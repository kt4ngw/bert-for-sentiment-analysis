1,Wow When I went to this film at the Toronto film festival I had no idea what I was in for This movie takes you on an emotional rollercoaster in the best sense of the term Sigourney Weaver was better than Ive seen from her in years Emile Hirsch was great and Jeff Daniels broke my heart I can see how this wont be every persons cup of tea as at times it deals with some pretty harsh things that can happen to a family Dont get me wrong  its really funny too  at my screening the audience burst out in applause after laughing over and over again I just think if youre open to examining your own life Imaginary Heroes will sincerely touch you I cant wait until it comes out in theaters
1,Most families will recognise similarities between their own family and that created through brilliant acting by Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon Natalie creates an on screen image that justifies her as one of the best actresses in America and one worthy of a Golden Globe Nomination The control of her emotions are so in tact that at any point in the movie she can tap into them and release an unforgettable scene Susan is also amazing in this movie as yet again she chose a role that is so different to any other and carries it through with true professionalism Any Natalie fan wouldve seen the film based on her past successes but you should also see it for the emotions that are released during the film It is a truly humbling experience
1,Got the chance to see this at a friends house today and was impressed with what it achieved on such a small budget Not that this ever bothered me anyway since I love low budget scifi like Dr Who Blakes 7 and Dark Star Hell even Outland wasnt a big budget affair so whilst money helps it takes more than throwing cash at things to make them good The story is straightforward at first with a group of mercenaries paid to escort a prisoner through space Their ship is attacked and they are forced to land on the nearest planet They then discover the prisoner has made it too hes a stone cold nut case and thats only the start of their problems The effects except for the gunfights are minimalistic and add to the film without overwhelming it Computer effects look a bit dodgy at times but serve their purpose well and add to the story lending a futuristic feel to the proceedings Films like I Robot could have benefited from this approach instead of being largely style over substance and substituting special effects for a plot like all too many of Hollywoods offerings Whilst none of the actors get Oscar material its tightly scripted and shot and at an hour and ten minutes doesnt outstay its welcome The characters dont get fleshed out much but then they didnt in Predator either which it resembles in feel Big man Mike Mitchell is a good stand in for Arnie and is a good combination of brains and brawn Some people may be annoyed at the lack of explanation towards the end but I like it Unlike a lot of films and shows which leave things unexplained it is not so obscure that you cant get a handle on it at all and Id like to see a sequel where the nature of the aliens is explored further A cracking little film from an enterprising team done on the cheap but a fun way to pass an hour If this is what they can do on a shoestring Id like to see what they would do with a bit more cash and hope the film industry and the talentless armchair critics dont knock all the creativity out of them first Recommended
1,Its a short movie for such immense feelings The last 20 or so minutes are among the most intense in the recent years of the industry Huston John is dying and only love can make the difference The actors work in the long evening scene is absolutely marvellous
1,I agree with with of the messages on here that the book is not like the movie I read the book as a sophomore in high school in Sumter SC I instantly fell in love with the book and eagerly awaited the release of the mini series As much as I liked the movie and thought it was very well done I was disappointed that the movie did not follow the book I was glad the Orry was not killed off like he was in Love and War or NS II Having grown up in SC and graduating from University of SC I fell in love with southern history because of this mini series and book I had the honor of meeting John Jakes at a symposium in 1988 at USC I stayed around afterwards and meet MrJakes Unfortunately I did not get to ask him a question But meeting him was honor enough I majored in accounting but got my minor in Southern Studies In addition I patterned a lot of my mannerisms after Orry Main Orry and myself are very much alike I feel I was born 150 years too late I am a southern gentleman and very proud of this Well I fell in love with 2 women in the movieGenie Francis and Wendy Kilbourne Man did I have the hots for Wendy I never quite could find a real life version of her I hope one day too
1,It kept me on the edge of my seat True the story has a few plot holes but the sheer tension of it the way the director just keeps challenging the premise is simply fascinating José Coronado and Adriana Ozores are two of Spains best actors see La vida mancha and Héctor and here they appear as a happy uppermiddle class couple Beneath it all the truth is that all of Coronados life is a lie Hes not an economist never went to college or does not work in Spains Central Bank Reserve as everybody else believes We get a few insights as to how he kept up appearances or manage to do it and while not very plausible it is still somehow believable The innerworkings of the scam are shown intermittently but it is credible because Coronado is a source of selfassurance and assertiveness He not only believes in the scam he also believes in the film premise and therefore he carries it Sure it tests belief that a wife would not know the inner workings of a marriages finances for almost 10 years but again since hes supposedly a brilliant economist It has been said in a nationalistic tone that the movie is not distinctively Spanish as if that were a litmus test for good film True no castanets or odd cabbies in this one just a taut thriller Youll want to know how this story ends once you start watching
1,This is such an exciting documentary it was by far one of the most fun films Ive ever seen I highly recommend it to anyone Its such a fun look at different musical styles exciting people at the crossroads between modern and traditional that is Istanbul and great cinematography that captures beautiful scenes in Istanbul and Thrace Watching the film made me want to book a flight for Istanbul right away Great footage of Ceza a Turkish rapper  Also his sister Ayben rapping  she is awesome Priceless performances by amazing Turkish musicians Orhan Gencebay Sezen Aksu Muzeyyen Senar The gorgeous voice of Aynur singing in Kurdish And amazing clarinet and signing of a romany gypsy group from Thrace Last but not least Istanbul bands mixing Turkish music and rock as well as trance music  Baba Zula Orient Expressions Duman and others
1,George Cuckor known as a director of women couldnt have hoped for two more talented and beautiful women for his last film Itself a remake of Bette Davis campy Old Acquaintance written by John Van Druten this film is definitely dated but still delightful Bergen and Bisset sparkle as best friends who compete at everything but manage to remain friends Liz Hamilton Bisset is a serious writer intellectual and elegant She meets her lifelong best friend Merry Noel at an exclusive girls school and they begin a lifetime of not always friendly competition Later in their lives when Liz is a promising but blocked writer of serious fiction Merry decides to try her hand at writing which infuriates her pal because of Merrys casual approach to the craft she herself takes perhaps a little too seriously  Much to Lizs chagrin Merrys trashy novels hit pay dirt and ultimately her old friend Liz is judging her novel for the National Book Award Bergen steals the show as the haughty writer of steamy bestsellers who schemes to bring together the broken pieces of her life in conjunction with her final literary triumph but alas things are never that simple The supporting cast includes David Selby whom you might remember as the tragic Quentin Collins from Dark Shadows Hart Bochner and of course a deliciously young and mercurial Meg Ryan in her first film role since leaving the soaps  Rich and Famous is catty campy witty and wise It culminates in a New Years fiasco that stresses the enduring nature of true friendship and I never let a year go by without watching it on New Years Eve Watch it and youll see why
1,I just got this movie for Christmas and have already added it to my favorites list A cute and simple story which makes a beautiful movie Who could not love Uncle Felix or not have their mouth water at the sound of all that food Definite points go to Sydney Greenstreet for his performance of Alexander Yardley and also to Reginald Gardiner who played John Sloane the impossibly boring fiancee Truly a gem to be watched every Christmas
1,I have never been as surprised by a film that was this old Only The Treasure of the Sierra Madre holds up this well performancewise As someone that has seen heroin addiction firsthand I was shocked at how realistic this film was Frank Sinatras performance is completely uncompromising realistic and heart wrenching Otto Premingers direction is perfect for the film with long takes and a very mobile camera Kim Novaks performance is good as is Eleanor Parkers In fact the entire supporting cast works very well with understated performances as befitting this films style The documentary style is part of what keeps this film up to date Highly recommended 80 out of 10
1,Based upon the novel The Dismissal by Ermanno Rea in essence the storys about the slow friendship that develops between an Italian maintenance technician Vincenzo Buonavolonta Sergio Castellitto who can be seen as the villainous King in Prince Caspian and was the lead in Bella Martha and a Chinese translator Liu Hua Ling Tai They set off actually on the wrong foot with the former chastising the latter for her inaccurate and slow translations of what he wanted to tell a Chinese delegate who had bought equipment that is faulty Vincenzo wants to do the right thing which is rare in these days and that is to tell the prospective buyers upfront the faults as well as the intricacies that their purchase would bring and given that hes disturbed by the fact that the deal still went ahead he takes time off to craft a component that would set things right But that also means to travel to China in search of the elusive machine which proves to be well hidden and seemingly having vanished without a trace With the initial reluctant help of Liu Hua they set off in this treasure hunt from city to city which brings us to lesser seen sights of China away from the Beijings and the Shanghais to cities like Wuhan with industrial like backdrops such as steel mills and nuclear plants with their smoke stacks dotting the scenery The mighty Yangtze River also makes an appearance Along the way the usual trappings of such travelogue styled movies come into play such as the learning of culture ideals food and basically the understanding that the world is without strangers if only one makes an effort to try and connect While hints of some romance between the two leads are suggested it rarely made itself to be a moot point until perhaps late in the movie hey opposites attract no Besides the major industrial plants and factories We get to see various cottage industry like seamstresses working in sweat shop like environments and I believe Cotton too along with noodle making As a film it provided me the travelling opportunity without leaving my seat to observe and credit to it for not passing judgement from a moral high ground on exploitation and the likes And kudos too for the movie to engage in dialogue based on the characters native tongues rather than and I shall not name names here some other movie  crosscultural collaborations where dialogue is forceddubbed and came off unnatural and truly irksome Some might deem the supporting characters to be too kind too always opening their arms and doors to a foreigner but I would like to imagine that maybe in the more rural areas people in general tend to be more sincere friendly and basically not get caught up in the rat race to trample on others or be trampled upon If theres a message to take away from the movie besides the fact that I mentioned that the world is without strangers is a reminder to myself that some of the stuff I deem important may not be so to others Importance is something one places upon something else and its basis really depends on how we define the boundaries we set So given our finite lifetime I think I should lighten up a bit more live and let live and sometimes bask in the illusion that ignorance could be bliss
1,Possibly the best John Travolta role ever Saturday Night Fever was a great movie  role but a LONG time ago I cant think of many of his movies or roles Ive even liked and its easy to think of rotten ones He can do meanies like in Pulp Fiction but he makes the perfect funky angel and its hard to imagine anyone doing a better equally slobby job with it Plot summaries are available everywhere but the plot isnt the point Just go for the ride and enjoy the cleverness of the little funnies along the way There is nothing to dislike about this movie unless one is searching for something profound I wish there were more movies like this We need a break from deep or awesome or grisly or complex or hysterical
1,I channel surfed past this many times mainly because the synopsis sounded so cheesy so Love American Style However it turned out to be quite good very well done The two standout features are the dialog and acting Great cast The premise is actually well executed and there arent too many weak moments I guess what I was most amazed by was how often you thought the wheels are going to come off the cart and instead the cart just banks the turns so to speak and the movie keeps flying There are some nice little subplots particularly the relationship that develops between the character played by former Conan sidekick Andy Richter Also want to mention that the music accompanying it was good
1,In a wordmagical And SO incredibly real Vijay Raaz is so incredibly raw so incredibly vulnerable that you just want his characters to succeed in whatever he does And he plays Hari Om impeccably from his absolutely perfect Bollywood eshtyle to his awkward shy manner with a first kiss He is a truly gifted actor and I wouldnt hesitate to see him in anything because he brings it all to life and gives it a soul Camille Natta is absolutely gorgeous It took some time for me to warm up to her possibly because she plays the role of an ignorant but fascinated tourist so well Her transition really became her and she molded into her role very well Even the man you love to hate her boyfriend Benoit was wonderful though you never really like him for the scum that he plays JeanMarie Lamour enacts a perfect cad The script so real I found myself turning to my friend repeatedly throughout the film to say thats exactly what happens in India they nailed it Very real very raw VERY bittersweet but you certainly leave the theater feeling fulfilled Music by Nitin Sawhney is wonderful and goes perfectly with the constantly changing moods But Vijay RaazI find myself constantly coming back to him because he is what MAKES this movie He is the hero the most charming disarming rickshaw driver you will ever encounter hes magical A lovely real sweet incredibly talented actor who I cannot wait to see shine and succeed in Bollywood Hollywood or anywhere
1,This show was so exhausting to watch and theres only two numbers Drowned World Substitute For Love and Paradise Not For Me were you can sit down and just contemplate it all The opening of this show will go down in history as the most visually thrilling as Madonna enters the stage via a gigantic Swarovski crystal ball that comes down from the ceiling and the huge screens from behind it show images of horses galloping Horses play a role in this show due to Madonna falling off one The infamous scene of Madonna on the crucifix is in this show as a huge screen counts to 12 million the number of how many African children are orphaned due to Aids At the end a website address comes up for anyone interested in donating We then go into the theme of the environment and again images of politics and religion are shown Theres an interlude and then the show starts again to the music of I Love New York and Ray of Light this part of the show is one of my favorites with the dancers doing there funny hand movements Towards the end theres the Music number with the song Disco Inferno mixed in with the song and the dancers make more of there presence known The ending again is full of energy as the show wraps up to the tunes of Lucky Star and Hung Up and hundreds of golden balloons fall from the ceiling at the end the message Have you confessed comes up The DVD is worth buying and when it came out the soundtrack for the show was added as a bonus Jonas Akerlund did a great job with the footage for this show keeping it consistent with the style of the tour
1,This is one of the best TV productions of a musical ever I have heard the Merman cast album the Angela Lansbury album I have seen Tyne Daly live and Ive seen the Rosalind Russell movie countless times I think Bette is if not the best then tied with the best She captures not just the bravura but also the pathos of Mama Rose I was never a Natalie Wood fan so I really enjoyed Cynthia Gibb in what is arguably her best role Everything from the costumes to the sets to the supporting performances is wonderful The three strippers led by the alwaysdependable Christine Ebersole are hard to top There was supposed to be a TV production of Mame a few years back with Cher but I think Bette would be the best bet pun intended for Auntie Mame
1,This is a great flick It is funny for everyone even adults We got Jason VoorheesLeatherface like killer in this along with other wacky characters Very funny flick for children of all ages Must of rented this every time we went to the video store Buster and Babs make a good pair and gotta love the duck He is probably my favorite character I was never big on the TV show but this movie just brings back so many great memories Must see for families fans of the show or anyone Enjoyable no matter how small or old you are RENT IT NOW AT YOUR LOCAL VIDEO STORE PS NEEDS A DVD RELEASE
1,Having just come home from my third viewing of The Curse Of The WereRabbit I decided to jump on IMDb and see what others thought I noticed a lot of Brits loved it while those in America just didnt get it That really doesnt come as any shock as America doesnt get what English is Wallace and Gromit are very English Middle class English in fact with a hint of eccentricity throw in for good measure The film is a lot like our two heroes simple and unassuming It has a nice and gentle plot so the children dont get lost yet theres enough beef there to keep the adults amused too Theres some light innuendo which seems have to have offended the evangelic  oh noes drama but there is nothing more rude than a bottom for a brief moment When people get offended by a plasticine anus you know the worlds messed up One quick note to those all American so far that I have seen who think Chicken Run is a better film Chicken Run was made to pander to your sense of humour and I think it suffered because of it Curse of the Were Rabbit is witty English and intelligent Thomas The Tank Engines film was ruined because it was made to please the Americans and Im glad Nick Park did not let that happen to another Great British institution To sum up You can keep your Chicken Runs your Shreks your Madagasgas  that kind of crude crass slapstick comedy just doesnt compare to the wit and grace that is Wallace and Gromit in Curse of the WereRabbit English to the core and long may Wallace and Gromit stay that way
1,I Would have to disagree strongly with the previous lame comment I watched this not expecting too much from it The Fact is that the cast were superb Especially The lead Teen Female The dark sides of them all came through all were messed up in an not obvious way There was an underlying current which ran through the movie of teenage angst and sexuality The serial killer role was played well also as you could feel he had gone through what they had as children What this movie is is a strong dramathriller Yes I would agree they dont do the obvious but you could relate with the messed up teenage heads they did what they did and it is believable Also a decent dark ending instead of which could have so easily been an opt out happy one The attention to detail in the movie was fantastic also I very good solid 7 out of 10 A little slow at times but lets a thinking person see where the characters are coming from
1,This is an unfortunately unrecognized classic The look is superb the design costumes etc are flawless the post battle scenes and the cavalry charge are both chilling and exciting The characters are vivid and really human Ardent is right and Fabrice Luchini as the lawyer Derville steals the movie with his clever pedantic rodentlike performance delighting in the ups and downs of others misfortunes Depardieu is good but perhaps too large a presence for this role Where the film really excels is the story and also its changes from Balzacs novella Those changes are editorial in that Balzac has lots of discussion on society and this film breaths with characters Nevertheless Yves Angelo has retained the key ingredient not just the missing man trying to regain his place in society but every character has to find their place in society the Comte Ferraud is trying to buy a peerage his wife Ardent comes from a lowly birth and when she was married to Colonel Chabert they achieved their position in the turbulence of postrevolutionary France Everyone has something to lose in terms of status and that makes for a good drama as their objectives are in conflict with each other It also feels very modern money is critical to buy status to reach power but someone can go down as quickly as they go up Derville enjoys the strategy he has seen the worst of people he says to Chabert when he takes the case This speechs original place is at the end of the novella as Balzac sums up the human comedy with huge irony
1,This movie is a very enjoyable homage to the Bogart and other detective films of old Robert Sacchi nails it as Bogie and Michelle Phillips is a truly timeless beauty as Gena Anastas  However the most noteworthy portion of this film involves the longest belly dancing scene ever produced in a Hollywood film One wellknown professional instructor commented that nothing else in cinema comes close for dance excitement  The scene which ends up being an important part of the plot occurs in a lushly beautiful Middle Eastern nightclub and is by all accounts mesmerizing The pulsating music the swirling veils and ringing finger cymbals freeflowing undulations and beautiful costumes  and a surprise twist involving the seductive Sybil Danning  build tension and excitement until the very end  The three talented and beautiful professional nightclub dancers are led by exotic brunette beauty Kamala Almanzar one of the US leading belly dancers since the mid1970s She was handpicked by famed Armenian musician Guy Chookoorian to travel with his orchestra on the road Guys ensemble is the live band that the dancers perform to in the scene If you watch the trailer on this site you will see a glimpse of Kamala playing the finger cymbals behind Sybil Danning  If youre not yet a fan of belly dancing you will be after watching this movie and if youre an aficionado it holds up very well after repeated viewing
1,A wonderful cast thrown into modern mystical romances for the intellectual grown ups Yes they too need a love story to stir those hidden urges without the Hollywood fluff This all under the masterful direction of Antonioni and Wenders who both love to pin his characters in exotic locations and have them dwarfed by the surroundings with long wide shots It is great to see that there is lust in the midlife crises sector
1,Until I saw this film life is beautiful was my favourite film of all time This film is everything a great film should be Great script unsurpassed acting and direction that neither approaches the sentimentalism the subject tempts nor leaves it without the emotional impact it demands This film contains the taste that could not come from Hollywood and lacks the pretencion that would come from France A wonderful movie even above the calibre I have come to expect when I see the handmade films logo come up I need not go into detail as the previous posts encompass everything why this movie has to be seen by everyone on this planet
1,SPOILER ALERT Dont read on unless youre prepared for some spoilers I think this film had a lot beneath its shell Besides the apparent connections with Oldboy and Parkwooks other films an incestuous relation in this one really disturbed me and also the subtle erotic theme that hung around all the vampiric physical action The main actor Kangho Song is terrific in the rôle of the priest Sanghyeon  coincidentally sang means blood in some languages  who truly loved Taeju played by OKbin Kim Their relationship reminds me a lot of that between Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek in Badlands where the girl appears psychopathic and the man is basically wrapped around her finger Their relationship is one thing but the girls mother is entirely different While moving she is stiff onedimensional and taut but paralysed she says all through not moving or through the wink of an eye Parkwook has really really mastered his cinematography in this film and owes a lot to Stanley Kubrick there are a whole lot of beautiful shots strewn throughout the film some for simple effects and some that require several glances and probably repeated views to fully catch The music is quite stock using mostly strings to accompany the main thespians monoreaction its a very good thing that the character is as withdrawn as he is While he does very little and loses at that he seems to instead be a person who thinks a lot While his loveinterest says and does a lot her actions display very little thought behind it In my humble opinion All in all a very disturbing film that is not made for action which isnt even in the same dimension as most things that are about vampires these days its magnificent and repellant at the same time
1,This late 50s French study of disaffected youth in their early 20s actuallygrown up but not yet settled down into the adult world probably missed the mark by a mile in terms of being an accurate depiction of 1958 French youth dont virtually ALL youth films made by adults do this The ones that dontRivers Edge comes to mind are rare indeed but directorwriter Marcel Carne of Les Enfants du Paradis fame is too accurate an observer of humanity to NOT provide an insightful view of the essence of these characters In a sense the details are not importantyou could change the details and set this film today and it would work just as wellbut the loneliness and insecurity and superficial passion and selfrighteous anger of the characters is captured well The young Pierre Brice and JeanPaul Belmondo are in supporting roles but leads Jacques Charrier Laurent Terzieff Pascale Petit and Andrea Parisy play the roles with subtlety and depth There is also a fine jazz score which you can get on the CD JAZZ IN PARISJAZZ  CINEMA VOL 2 Unlike some who have commented on the film I dont really see directorwriter Carne as sitting in judgment on these charactershe seems as though he is an objective observer to me Of course these middleclass characters may seem like people who are spoiled and have nothing to whine about to some workingclass viewers of the film and I think Carne is certainly aware of this For this American viewer I watched a dubbed fairly literally Id say version of this titled THE CHEATERS the film provides an interesting window into the France of the 1950s It also is selfconsciously poetic the scene on the ledge saving the cat is but one example of this and has intellectual aspirations in that charming way that only French films can get away withI can imagine the heavyhanded melodramatic shallow way this kind of material would have been handled by an American studio production and the sensationalistic moralistic suggestive way this kind of material would have been handled by American driveinexploitation filmmakers I feel that Marcel Carne has captured the essence of that period between say high school graduation and when by ones early 30s people have largely settled into a routine whatever that routine may be Those willing to watch the film with an open mind and not fire away at the many easy targets it offers should find a serious and valuable study of people in their early twenties And even if you dont want to do that you can go in the other room while the film is playing and simply enjoy the fine soundtrack with great 50s jazz and instrumental pop including the wonderful original score by an American Jazz at the Philharmonic group including Coleman Hawkins Dizzy Gillespie Stan Getz spelled goetz in the credits Roy Eldridge and Ray Brown
1,So its not an award winner so what Have you ever wanted to see a film that was just silly The Villain and this one could top the listMy husband says that Jekyll and Hyde Together Again is one of those movies that if youve been there and done that youll think this spoof on the 80s cocaine culture is a riot I think the whole film is just fun Nothing is sacred hospitals plastic surgery Howard Hughes There are ongoing gags that you have to watch for to appreciate To say that the film doesnt follow the book would be true but then a lot of really good films take liberties with the published word also I recommend this movie to all the old stoners among us We may be smarter now but we will still recognize and laugh at many folks we knew ourselves back in the old days
1,Russell T Davies has been tasked with recreating a slice of my childhood hiding behind the sofa watching scary monsters battle with Dr Who He and his crew are clearly all true devotees of the original series In much the same way as the Star Trek movies used their budget to make the Gene Rodenberrys original concept far more believable Russell T Davies has both money and the advantages of excellent CGI to create the best monsters ever I am sure that this series was made with a budget that anticipated both export and DVD sales and it really feels as if no expense was spared The accompanying series Dr Who Confidential shows the work that goes into each episode which is a really useful behind the scenes insight Interviews with the cast and writers help retell the story from each characters perspective and are far more useful than simply watching the whole programme over again How does David Tenant rank in the pantheon of his illustrious predecessors Time will tell but tonight seeing Billie Piper play alongside Elisabeth Sladen who was the Doctors companion in the 1970s confirm that she has both the acting ability screen presence and script to be the No 1
1,The Knowledge is a typical British comedy for the period To someone who is not familiar of the process of becoming a London cabby the film is bound to seem very average with a few laughs from a few old faces The Knowledge however comes into its own for Knowledge boys like myself or their wifes who know what these poor individuals are going through And find yourself comparing incidents of your own to that of the characters
1,Some Spoilers It took some 19 years for Bruce Campbell to finally put his masterpiece  Man with the Screaming Brain on the screen But Campbell had to alter his story by having it due to financial problems take place in Sofia Bulgaria not where he initially wanted it to be filmed in Los Angeles California In the film Burce Campbell plays US pharmaceutical tycoon Willian Cole who travels together with his spoiled rotten wife Jackie Antoinette Byronto the former Communist Republic of Bulgaria Its there that William wants to help finance Bulgarias almost nonexistent mass transportation system Its poor Williams misfortune to get involved with both Gypsy woman Tatoya Tamara Gorski and her exboyfriend Yegor Valdimir Kolev an exKGB taxi driver The two William  Yegor will unwittingly end up shearing their brains inside Williams skullbecause of Tatoyas jealousy and vindictiveness After Tatoya murders both William and Yegor their bodies are delivered to mad scientist Dr Ivan Ivanowitch Ivanov Stacy Keach by his loyal assistant Pavel Ted Raimi to have their brains experimented with Dr Ivanov has this theory in that two heads are better then one And now with the material William  Yegor available to him Dr Ivanov at last is finally going to prove it What Dr Ivanov is going to sadly find out is that by fusing the two heads or brains together their brain waves will overlap and cause them to not only malfunction but turn against each other William with Yegors right lobe fused into his damaged brain is out to find Tatoya and make her pay for the damage she caused both him and Yegor Yegor for his part is stuck in Williams head whos likes and dislikes in both food and drink are totally opposite to his own This causes a lot of tension and hostility between the two brains in them fighting for control of Williams body Things get even more screwed up when Jackie finding out that Tatoya murdered her husband William confront her in the dangerous and high crime section of Bravoda call Gypsy Town and ends up being murdered herself Brought back to Dr Ivanov by his assistant Pavel its determined with no body availableto plant Jackies brain inside of an experimental robot that Pavels been working on The operation is a rousing success but the only drawback is that Jackie with her brain inside the robot has to have her brain recharged every few hours Or like a real brain lacking oxygen shell die together with the robots batteries Combination 1930slike screwball comedy and horror flick with both William  Yegor turning the Bulgarian town of Bravoda upside down in trying to find Tatoya and make her pay with her life for the sad state of existence she put them both into  SPOILER ALERT Its Dr Ivanov who in fact saves the day by discovering how to keep the two brains from fighting and thus cooperating with each other This is done by him instead of fusing the brains together Dr Ivanov keep them independent by implanting a neutralizing cell wall in between the two uncooperative globs of gray matter
1,I think this film version of NORTHANGER ABBEY is actually quite good It certainly is amusing Well its not a masterpiece as PRIDE AND PREJUDICE 95 but theres very good stuff in it especially the City of Bath setting The Royal Crescent the Roman Baths the fascinating Georgian atmosphere That is excellent If you are a Bath fan like myself youll love watching this film The performances may sound a bit too melodramatic but Ive got the impression that this film like the novel itself is deliberately making fun of the popular tales of romance and terror and of the society of the period The only drawback is probably the female lead as I personally have another idea of Catherine Morlands physical appearance The music is also a bit unusual but I strangely find it acceptable despite its got nothing to do with the historical period portrayed Im wondering what would dear old Jane think
1,Lead actor Yuko Tanaka fulfills so much in the exceptionally meditative The Milkwoman a tranquil canvass on missed chances in the life of a 50something woman charting her routine with sincerely poignant motives Played out in the picturesque tranquil town of Nagasaki Akira Ogatas unconventional romantic film so to speak is less a straightout melodrama than a deliberate introspection of its characters surrender to their current lives as a result of a tragic past that forced them to a choice they did not call for Perfectly embodying the requisite worldweariness subjected to a spiritless routine Tanaka plays Minako Oba a middleaged woman who before her work shift at a supermarket takes it upon herself to deliver bottles of milk among the residents of the hilly Nagasaki One of the houses she constantly passes by to make such a delivery is that of Kaita Takanashi Ittoku Kishibe a local government employee caring for her terminally ill wife Akiko Nishina Minako and Kaita were high school sweethearts who courtesy of an ignominious event concerning their parents separated ways since then Opening his film with the foreboding narration of a young Minako vowing never to leave Nagasaki Ogata does as such with the narrative patiently sticking with Minako as he deftly aided by Tanakos understated yet highly effective performance follows her  whether shes having chitchat with her aunt Misako Watanabe on being single or when she jogs up and down the countless footsteps of their hilly town to distribute milk  as she and Kaita gradually overcome the hindrances that kept them apart for years Such unhurried development may not suit viewers weaned on fastpaced narratives but for the rest its a heartfelt introspection that affects powerfully and emphatically
1,I have nothing but praise for this movie and cast especially Ann Margaret But more importantly I have praise for my inlaws who were are the adoptive parents of Warren and Frank in real life I met most of the children at Warrens wedding in 1989 This is an amazing story and is even more incredible to me knowing the family and what everyone went through It is also enjoyable for me to see how my inlaws were portrayed in the movie It was pretty accurate My wife even enjoys seeing some little details such as a toaster that she remembered from her childhood Yes it is a hard movie to watch but so amazing and heartfelt The beauty of this story for me is how many of the children passed through my inlaws lives and as a result of marrying their daughterand having Warren as a brotherinlaw how many I have met in mine For the past 20 years this story has been a part of my life because of what my motherinlaw has shared with me That and knowing Warren For what it is worth Warren lives in California with his family He married his high school sweetheart who he reconnected with at his 20 year high school reunion There was a show in the 1980s called Thats Incredible They had a reunion of the family who also got to meet the cast of the show For anyones interest the DVD is available in Great Britain and Australia It is a tough video to come by here in the United States and I have not been able to find a DVD here yet
1,Being a freshman in college this movie reminded me of my relationship with my mom Of course my situation doesnt parrallel with Natalie Portman and Surandons situation but my mom and I have grown up with the typical mother and daughter fights There is always the mother telling you what to do or not being the kind of mother you want to be I was balling my eyes at the end of this movie Surandons reaction of her daughter going to the East coast miles away after all theyve been through reminded me of how I felt being from a small city in the West coast going to New York  The movie is meant for women who have children that are now all grown up It is very touching I was moved by the movie Every feeling out of the characters in this movie was utterly real you didnt get any phony sentimentality I was sitting through the credits at the screening of this movie alone wishing my mother was sitting next to me so I could hug her and thank her for everything This movie is a bit corny of course but everything is trully momentous Its all about what a mom can learn from her child and what a child learns from her mother 810
1,Guilt and redemption are two of the staple emotions and plot elements of the heavy powerful dramas that the Oscars love so much which is kind of funny since The Kite Runner was only nominated for Best Original Scorethe lack of nominations was perhaps unjust While most film adaptations of books or any other means are usually inferior to their literary counterparts and The Kite Runner is NOT an exception Marc Forsters film adaptation is a good one Most people are familiar with the story the book having been read by millions so I wont go into the plot except to say that the book stays pretty faithful to its source That being said if you dont know the plot see the movie or better yet read the book The best thing The Kite Runner has going for it other than its story is director Marc Forster Forster is a director with epic scope and unique vision that is perfectly utilized in bringing Khaled Hosseinis book to the screen A small part of me worried that he would use the same dreamy images that were included in one of Forsters earlier features Finding Neverland Dont get me wrong Finding Neverland is a wonderful film one of my favorites actually but the visual trickery he used in there doesnt have a place here Fortunately Forster understands that and the brilliance of his direction shows his versatility Though the lack of a Best Director nomination for his work here is not exactly a travesty I see a number of statuettes in store for him down the road Also of note is the screenplay adaptation It remains faithful to the source but it leaves room for Forsters vision to interpret the material The dialogue is not dumbed down and it along with Forsters direction moves at a solid pace Like Forster the lack of recognition at awards time for the screenplay was not an outrage but I wouldnt have complained if it was at least nominated The dividing line here between this film being great and outstanding lies with the acting Most of the performances are solid but there are some that dont quite make the cut and it hurts the film The most notable weak performance comes from Zekeria Ebrahimi who plays the young Amir Its not that its bad its just that its not as effective as it could be He just cant translate the guilt that consumes Amir to the audience In fact I think I might have been a little lost at this point in the movie at this point had I not read the book because of this He looks somber and at times resentful but we cant feel his emotions This is a difficult part to portray and for the most part young Ebrahimi holds his own which is especially surprising since this is his first film role The best performances come from Khalid Abdalla who plays the adult Amir and Shaun Toub who plays the wise Rahim Kahn Abdalla may not be a known name though he was in Paul Greengrasss United 93 but his work here is amazing Hes a quiet modest man and he emotes perfectly when needed to A lessercapable actor could have made the character of Rahim Khan into a cliché but Shaun Toub uses enough subtlety and care in his performance that he creates what the clichés are trying to portray Forgive me if I go on a rant here but this is something that I must address and that is the films PG13 rating The fact that this film received such a low rating is outrageous There is no justification for it Some could argue that the rating was bent because of the need for everyone to see it like the gore in Saving Private Ryan which some say should have earned the film an NC17 rating But that exception cannot be applied here The only purpose the scene serves is to tell the story Forster probably at the behest of the producers tried as hard as he could to tame the films most painful and disturbing scene to allow the film to sneak by with a PG13 rating but the subject material is too disturbing to be depicted in any way and get less than an R rating regardless of if how tasteful is may be portrayed Worse this editing robs the scene of much of its power and by trying it make it less disturbing to get the lower rating is insulting Furthermore some scenes of violence are incredibly disturbing as well In terms of how much time these scenes take of the movie it doesnt add to much but what is there is well deserving of an R rating at the very least The MPAA whose system of rating movies has always been corrupt has sunk to a new low by giving this film such a low rating But one shouldnt fault the film for this The film is a solid film that is wellworth seeing especially if they are fans of the book
1,Feels like an impressionistic film if there is such a thing The story is well told very poetic the characters well developed and well acted by the interpreters or interpreted by the actors  The film delights in its own sumptuous emotions at times and works well unless you hate such emotion in movies  not so in my case Its a very humanistic film The landscape and even the extraordinary situation of the displaced cook are very poetic in their own right Well done A good classic for any good film collection
1,My Father The Hero used to be my favorite movie when I was Younger Its about Andre a divorced french man who wants to take his beautiful daughter katharine heigl on a vacation hoping to get a little closer to her But of course Nicole isnt that easy to get along with she just started puberty im guessing She is angry and hurt that her father was never there for her and decides to give him a hard time One day at the beach Nicole meets handsome Ben and she makes up a wild story about her and her dad The whole island gets involved and the movie turns into a hilarious wild entertaining movie I would give My Father The Hero 810
1,This movie packs a punch There are a few every now and then that make me think deeply and disturb me a lot I could see myself in this same predicament  passively allowing things to happen around me not standing up for the right and decent thing just trying to avoid trouble How often do we avoid making waves or sticking our necks out How often does our inaction condone the evil actions of others We would never join them we tell ourselves we recognize that what they are doing is bad but do we do anything about it  Lawrence Newman William H Macey is a lowkey nerdy office worker who has paid off his home in Brooklyn NY in the waning days of World War II He rarely gets engaged in what is going on around him has never married rarely socializes just goes to work and cares for his invalid mother Then a series of events in his very white little neighborhood pull him out of his complacent shell into a maelstrom of events It starts as he witness from his bedroom window the rape of a Puerto Rican girl by the son of his neighbor Soon after he gets glasses because of poor vision As he is now better able to see he becomes less able to deal with the circumstances of his life The one bright spot is a new love in his life and he marries hoping to continue on in his normalcy Then the virulent antisemitism on that street catches him despite his credentials as a Presbyterian WASP As things spiral further out of control he discovers he must make an important decision  does he take a stand or does he simply go away I cannot how anybody can view this movie without being affected and having to think very much about themselves and what they really stand for Post war antisemitism is the setting here but there is injustice at all times and in all places It is for the individual to decide where he or she stands
1,The world is going to miss John Frankenheimer This was his first feature film and it was four years before he directed his second but dont let that dissuade you from seeking it out Frankenheimers direction is assured and he gets some compelling performances out of his cast Someone else has already pointed them out but I also want to talk up James Gregory and Whit Bissell in two key supporting roles Both would work for Frankenheimer again  Gregory most notably as the bumbling senator in The Manchurian Candidate  and they do good work for him here If the whole thing seems too simple in the end thats merely because Frankenheimer and writer Robert Dozier chose to tell a simple story and they do it well Keep a lookout for it  Turner Classic Movies just might show it again
1,Luc Bessons first work is also his first foray in science fiction a genre to which he will return fourteen years later with the Fifth Element 1997 Even if this film was strongly influenced by Hollywood cinema it is still highly enjoyable Back in 1983 le Dernier Combat reveals Bessons own approach of science fiction He takes back a threadbare topic and his efforts are discernible to make a stylish work Shot in widescreen and black and white a disaster has destroyed virtually all the population from earth and we will never know what was this disaster and why men cant talk any more Some barbarian hordes were formed In parallel a man Pierre Jolivet lives on his own and arrives in an unrecognizable Paris where he is received by a doctor Jean Bouise There are no words in Bessons work The characters actions and the progression of the events go through looks and gestures Although the starting point and the backdrop are unnerving the film has never the look of a despondent one It seems that the man and the doctor try to reproduce gestures and actions linked to mankind before the disaster The film opens with the man having sex with an inflatable doll Later the doctor tries to make him speak through a machine and he is a painter in his spare time Its all the more intriguing as these paintings seem to come from the prehistoric times Following this reasoning one could argue that the bearded giant Jean Reno embodies evil and a threat to the efforts deployed by the man and the doctor to regain what finally made a human being Ditto for the gang of baddies at the beginning of the film The pessimistic whiff that such a film could convey isnt really at the fore and gives way to a glimmer of hope Personally the film could have gained with no music at all except the one the man can hear with his cassette recorder Luc Besson was to make better and still entrancing films like this one he also boosted Pierre Jolivets career as a director who will leave a patchy work behind him in the future Force Majeure 1989 Simple Mortel 1991 ma Petite Entreprise 1999 or Filles Uniques 2003
1,This is my favorite Mel Brooks movie because it was the first one I ever saw I was in the fourth grade when it came out and I watched it all the time I saw The Producers second and then Blazing Saddles This is a sentimental favorite because it was my first Mel Brooks movie
1,This film makes several nods to various science fiction films The prologue reminds me of the one for the original theatrical version of THX1138 the trailer for BUCK ROGERS here it was clips from some early Japanese SF TV show Then the opening shot of the city in 2345 has the dragon blip flying overhead with a billboard reminding one immediately of BLADERUNNER The BLADERUNNER aspect comes even more pronounced when we meet the hero who is called a Replicant He is blond haired and is called Ryo a homage to Roy Batty Rutger Hauers character in BLADERUNNER A battle scene soon ensues which reminds one immediately of THE MATRIX The government forcing the population to take drugs is like THX1138 and the chief enforcer while looks like a cross between Elvis and Dan Ackroyd turns out to be a robot very much like the TERMINATOR The end battle reminds one of TERMINATOR 2 and the end result is hilarious Probably not one of the best SF films out there but is enjoyable certainly a lot more enjoyable than tripe like BATTLEFIELD EARTH
1,This depiction of forlorn Japanese forces in the Philipines is a tour de force in the utter meaninglessness of war It is an effective representation of Japanese pacifist views after WW II In the movie Japanese soldiers have been left to fend for themselves in the jungles of the Philipines Faced with impending starvation they resort to cannibalism and gradually lose what little humanity they have left To call this film depressing would be something of an understatement The viewer is left with an utterly despairing sense of lifes lost value in modern combat The final scene is almost too nihilistic but the film is a worthy statement nonetheless Highly recommended
1,spoiler In 1993 AfricanAmerican directoractor Mario Van Peebles followed up the tremendously popular urbanaction film New Jack City with Posse The film was cowritten and directed by Van Peebles who also stars as the main character Jessie Lee Plot The film begins at the turn of the 20th century when the United States was embroiled in the SpanishAmerican war Apparently a time when the US justice system could send convicts into military service Jessie Lee finds himself an unwilling enlisted man serving with an allblack cavalry troop in Cuba Some of his compatriots include Little J Stephen Baldwin fasttalking Weezie Charles Lane and the toweringbutsimple Obobo Tiny Lister They find a hidden chest of gold on a reconnaissance run and decide to keep it However the ambitious bigoted Colonel Graham Zane finds out about the gold and is apparently willing to kill Jessie Lee and company for it A shootout between the Grahams forces and Jessie Lees leaves the colonel blind in one eye and his forces retreat Jessie Lees ragtag crew manage to smuggle themselves and the gold back to New Orleans but it turns out that Graham isnt far behind Jessie Lee and his allies are forced to go on the run heading west to a town called Freemanville Apparently Freemanville was founded by blacks in the years following the Civil War Jessie Lees father King David was the charismatic preacher who cofounded the town However as is revealed in intermittent flashbacks King David was soon brutally murdered by a white mob in a parallel of the Ku Klux Klan terror campaigns that began around the same time Jessie Lee and company eventually find their way to Freemanville only to find that the townsfolk arent exactly glad to see himespecially when Sheriff Bates Richard Jordan of a nearby white township makes it clear that he wants Jessie Lee and his partnersdead or alive Carver Blair Underwood is the sheriff and de facto mayor of Freemanvilleand his own agenda may not square with having Jessie Lee around Analysis The action sequences are all very credible and Mario Van Peebles turns in a good performance as the brooding hero In the aftermath of the success of New Jack City it was almost expected Van Peebles would helm a sequel or at least a similar urbanaction followup Instead Van Peebles looked 100 years into the past creating a mostlyblack Western effectively updating the blackthemed Westerns of the 1970s and continuing the legacy of largelyforgotten blackthemed cowboy films from the early 20th century Unlike New Jack City the film was independently financed and originally released through GramercyPolygram Entertainment Allegedly execs at the major studios balked when Van Peebles pitched Posse to them Some of the more curious casting at the time involved rappers Big Daddy Kane and Tone Loc as Father Time and Angel respectively In certain interviews Mario Van Peebles has said that he often likes to cast against type in the years since the trend of casting rap singers in nonmusical films would become almost commonplace Keen viewers will notice several cameos by various entertainment personalities Blackaction film veterans like Isaac Hayes Truck Turner Pam Grier Foxy Brown and Larry Cook The Spook who Sat by the Door show up as does standup legend Nipsey Russell not to mention TV producer Stephen J Cannell who hired the junior Van Peebles to star in Sonny Spoon years earlier The film is bookended with Woody Strode Spartacus in a key role
1,Russian actress TATIANA SAMOILOVA reminds me so much of the young Audrey Hepburn and the camera in THE CRANES ARE FLYING seems to love her just as much She is the focal point of a bittersweet war romance against the background of World War II in Moscow The film is almost poetic in its gorgeous BW cinematography which was the main reason for watching the film in the first place since I had never heard of it and decided to give it a try when it aired on TCM Its a very moving love story about a girls deep love for a man who is suddenly swept away by his role as a soldier drafted in wartime Russia Shes unable to forget the memory of her romantic attachment to him but inexplicably marries someone else who has forced himself on her a pianist who soon realizes that she still loves the soldier she hopes to hear from Their marriage is a troubled one because she cant let go of her remembrance of a happier time with her soldier sweetheart By the end of the story she accepts the idea that hes never going to return and is able to face reality and cope with the situation Theres a very poignant final scene at a train station where arriving soldiers are greeting their loved ones and the tearful girl shares the joy of the returning soldiers by giving some flowers from her bouquet to the joyous families The stylish and striking camerawork is what carries the film as well as the honestly played story Tastefully done but perhaps the English subtitles didnt tell the whole tale because some of the plot elements seemed a bit blurred to me as if they had been glossed over Summing up Easy to see why it won awards at the Cannes Film Festival Reminded me in style of another great Russian film BALLAD OF A SOLDIER
1,stuey unger was a card playing legend he was quoted in an interview as saying Some day I suppose its possible for someone to be a better No Limit Holdem player than me I doubt it but it could happen But I swear to you I dont see how anyone could ever play gin better than me theres a gin rummy scene in this movie that is so amazing you could have plopped it in XMen as a showcase for a superheros mutant power thats how incredible this man was i have a few minor problems with this movie as dark as this movie was stueys real life was darker poker pro todd brunson said During the last World Series of poker Bob Stupak Mike Sexton and I had a drink and talked about Stu Mike told us how he could barely talk hadnt showered in weeks and how his fingers were burned black by a crack pipe in the film michael imperioli looked far too healthy to be stu unger in the final years of his life when stuey won his last wsop he looked like a skeleton but lets face it this production lacked both the time and the deniro to make that kind of transformation my other problem was that i wish there was more poker playing with actual hands and situations sure it might have bored the average non poker enthusiast but it would have been nice for the hardcores too bad the movie wasnt 6 hours or so longer i watched the movie with 3 non poker players and they all thoroughly enjoyed it just like you dont have to be a former member of the colonial army to enjoy Gibsons the patriot you dont have to be a poker player to see this gem cant wait for the DVD 8 out of 10
1,I had always heard about this great miniseries but viewed it for the first time this week July of 2007 I can see why it started the careers of so many young actors The story is intriguing and gives wonderful insights into the period before and during the Civil War I cared about the characters and how their lives evolved during this period Some of them were stereotypes but they still helped me see how people thought during the 1800s Many historical facts were thrown into the story and it was interesting to see history books come to life The costumes and sets were gorgeous I thoroughly enjoyed watching both parts I and II Part III is a disappointment
1,Ok maybe Posse cant compare to other popular cowboywestern movies But thats because it didnt have the FUNDING those movies had Obviously whenever you want to produce a story such as this one focusing on African American historical involvement and NO servants and mammies are not historical involvement Hollywood isnt going to be too supportive And believe me they werent The producers and actors sacrificed a lot of out of pocket expenses to make Posse just so that the story could be told I think that alone is commendable Posse may not be Oscar material and they dont like Black media too much either but it is a start It is entertaining and it introduces us to the black cowboy a character most of us are unfamiliar with
1,Ive watched this movie on a fairly regular basis for most of my life and it never gets old For all the snide remarks and insults mostly from David Spade Tommy Boy has a giant heart And thats what keeps this movie funny after all these years Tommy Callahan Chris Farley is the son of Big Tom Callahan Brian Dennehy master car parts salesman and has ridden on that all his life But after his died dies on his wedding day Tommy learns that the company is in debt and about to be bought by Ray Zalinsky Dan Akroyd the owner of a huge car parts company So in order to save the company Tommy has to go on the road to sell the companys new brake pads Along for the ride though not by choice is Richard Hayden David Spade a former classmate of Tommys who was Big Toms righthand man The movie rides on the chemistry between the two SNL stars and reallife best friends Chris Farley and David Spade The duo has enough comic energy going between them to power the world Its the big dumb guy versus the smart little guy It works and some of their scenes are unforgettably funny Farley and Spade are actually decent dramatic actors as well Although the film is primarily a comedy it has its fair share of drama but Spade and especially Farley are just as good there as when theyre making the audience laugh Forgive me but I have to talk about Chris Farley a little more I read his biography The Chris Farley Show A Biography in Three Acts for anyone who cares and understanding who Chris was in real life made this movie more special to me Chris Farley was a genuinely good person who struggled and ultimately failed to conquer his addictions Although this was the first movie he had a major role in it is his best film It really showed who he was and just how much talent he had Knowing Chriss story adds another layer to this movie although it doesnt make it any less funny Farley and Spade are matched with a good on screen cast Rob Lowe is suitably slimy as Tommys new brother and Bo Derek is solid as his stepmother Brian Dennehy is great as Big Tom Dennehy makes it easy to believe that theyre father in son Big Tom is just as crazy as his son although hes smarter and more mature Dan Akroyd gives one of his best performances as Zalinsky giving Tommy the hard truth behind advertising Julie Warner is also good as Tommys love interest Michelle For me Peter Segal is one of the great comedy directors He keeps the pace quick and energetic but most importantly he knows how to make comedy funny He doesnt belabor the jokes and he understands that funny actors know what theyre doing and he allows them to do it But Segal goes a step further He gives Tommy Boy a friendly almost nostalgic tone that both tugs the heartstrings genuinely and tickles the funnybone Critics didnt like Tommy Boy Shame on them A movie doesnt have to be super sophisticated or subversively intellectual to be funny God forbid Farley and Spade were forced to do muted comedy a la The Office This is a great movie and one of my alltime favorites
1,Saw the movie last night wo knowing anything about it nothing else out seemed interesting and I had a Buffalo connection to this movie  UB grad It was a very enjoyable movie Liked the pace it picks up after a slow beginning and story Well written plot and good character development and relationships Highly recommend it to anyone who likes to see movies that have interesting stories Found myself talking about this movie afterwards over a few beers  most discussions dont last more than a few minutes
1,Unfortunately Ive never seen the full version of this movie I did see the 87minute version twice back in the 1950s Even more floridly directed than is the norm with Julien Duvivier this is a wonderfully outoftheordinary piece replete with sweeping tracking shots through over and into Andrejews magnificently atmospheric sets Beautifully lit too by photographer André Thomas Black Jack is nothing if not a connoisseurs delight Reinforcing this imaginative visual style is a script that allows a roster of our favorite actors including Agnes Moorehead and Marcel Dalio some brilliantly bizarre fullblooded characterizations George Sanders gives a polished performance whilst an eccentric millionairess who turns out to be a rival racketeer is admirably played by Agnes Moorehead Also realizing the most from her role Patricia Roc The film was made on locations in Spain in 1949
1,This movie is BRILLIANT I dont remember this movie even BEING in theaters so thinking it was a straight to DVD I have fairly low expectations even though I am a big fan of Mike Judge It has some of the same kind of comic future satire as Brazil and Demolition Man but taken to the next level Then I saw the cast Luke Wilson Maya Rudolph and Dax Shepard who were all brilliant in their roles Needless to say this movie won me over in the first 5 minutes where it shows aboveaverage people having fewer children and the poorest stupidest trashiest people having lots of ignorant children and how this is leading to a kind of reverse evolution It takes that concept and then shows where we are headed with this pollution of the gene pool Sadly I dont think it will take the 500 years as depicted but probably only about 50 I already see the shocking rise of mild retardation in the general populace media and culture People who like classical music and art are ridiculed instead of respected The lowest common denominator seems to rule especially in Hollywood and on TV eg Jackass the Movie and any reality show where they make you eat something disgusting or humiliate yourself for money All of the politicalsocial satire aside this movie is also just LAUGH OUT LOUD funny And I dont say that lightly few movies make me actually LOL but this one did A lot of the best jokes are wordsight gags in the background so you really have to pay attention to get some of them I even had to pause and zoom in for a few of them like when Joe got his government ID and for hair it said yes and for eyes it also said yes Also the prison has engraved on the front House for Particular Individuals since the cops in the movie much like real life cops call everyone individuals instead of people etc Again this was on the screen for just a momentthis is one of those movies you can watch again and again and dissect it to get through the layers of funny Also I normally watch movies with the subtitles on and that clued me in to some jokes that might pass by your ears in the dialog mix for instance the police constantly talk about people excaping instead of escaping and there are many other mispronunciations that just cracked me up But again I might not have picked up on them just by the dialog mixed with musicsound effects it is very subtle but still hilarious Additionally the special effects were REALLY GOOD for a scifisocial satire I could go on and on but overall I think this is one of those movies that if you DONT think its funny its probably making fun of YOU I plan on recommending this to many many people
1,The Falcon and the Snowman is the true story of two collegeage rich kids from LA who become spies for the Soviet Union One played by Penn is already a drug smuggler up to his eyeballs in trouble The other played by Hutton lands a position at an aerospace firm where his job is to man a topsecret cable facility There he learns of some of the dirty tricks employed by the CIA on foreigners that America doesnt like Dont forget that the movie is set the early 70s the time of Vietnam and Watergate Appalled at what hes learned the Hutton character decides to betray his country and convinces his buddy to join him Neither of them is long on brains it is not long before theyre way in over their heads with no way out This is not a thriller and is rather slowly paced If this is not a problem for you then it is well worth the rental
1,Better than average World War IIera whodunit featuring Warner Baxter as a former gangster who suffered amnesia and has been reborn as a psychiatrist now known as Robert Ordway who helps both the police and criminals who want to go straight Crime Doctors Courage is the fourth in the series of ten and also involves a victim who might have some mental problems The link to courage is not particularly clear This entry revolves around the death of fortune hunter Gordon Carson whose two previous wives have under mysterious circumstances and who in turn dies in a locked room under conditions that resemble suicide but Dr Ordway labels murder Hillary Brooke plays the part of widow Kathleen Carson who is involved with Anthony Caruso  a mysterious Spanish dancer whose act includes his sister that disappears on stage As a mystery novelist Jerome Cowan is a good supporting actor as is Lloyd Corrigan as an aficionado in crime Spooky houses with creaking doors caskets in the cellar and suspects that are never seen in daylight add to the air of suspense The set for the dance sequence is quite elaborate and the ballet music very good Direction production design and photography stand out The exterior shots and costumes suggest more affluence rather than normally found in the average B detective thriller Strongly recommended
1,First off let it be known that I came into this movie not for the music actually I find it repugnant Really I was interested in the psychology of the punk subculture On this point the documentary did fairly well One disagreeable aspect was the numerous scenes in which songs are played and the hypedup band and belligerent crowd are shown running amok If youve seen the first such scene youve seen them all This superfluity is party made up for by printing lyrics for some of the songs With these the audience is able to somewhat connect mentally with the band The lyrics are of far more interest than the jumble of sounds projecting from the speakers I dont know why all the lyrics were not printed Scenes without lyrics slow ironic eh given the many references to the speed of the music the flow of the movie Also insightful were the interviews with fans and bands though there is a letdown when the latter bands interviews prove to be not nearly as enthralling or humorous as the first two Overall a good movie that Im glad I saw Ill check out the followups if I ever get a chance Favorite quote He tried to hide the fact that he couldnt play by rubbing peanut butter over himself and breaking glass  Broad punk generalization Though their disgracefulness lack of vocabulary and hygiene and druginduced obliviousness is often hilarious in the end it is understood that punks are just pathetic juveniles who rebel just for the sake of rebellion as seen through sophomoric lyrics and naive attempts to philosophize and politicize disregarding Black Flag who are slightly less misguided than their peers
1,This is probably one of the best Portuguese movies I ever saw I absolutely enjoyed the plot because by the way the story was developing you would get more involved on how their world was really upsidedown There is just only one part that doesnt really seem to fit in the movie which is the girls strip It does not add anything important to the story it looks like its just there for a men entertaining purpose The ending is a bit unexpected though at the same time somewhat expected If you dont understand then follow me after so many strange occurrences the viewer is so used to oddities that ending the movie with totally unexpected relationships Like Mimoso and Susana sounds totally natural after seeing the rest of the movie But most of all Sorte Nula is a movie that makes you think hard trying to solve the mysterious occourings laugh your head off with their unlucky lives and mess with your perception of what can happen in just a few minutes when you turn your back away from something for all that I rate it 810
1,A gritty Australian film with all the elements for success Two Hands represents the ability of Australian film makers and actors to produce topquality popular material The film has a fresh angle and uniquely incorporates drama suspense and comedy I found this film thoroughly enjoyable on so many different levels  but can also appreciate that it might not be everyones cup of tea The film carries a distinct Aussie humour as it portrays the seedy underworld of Sydney and explores the lives of a young man Ledger and young woman Byrne swept up in the local crime scene Two Hands deals with the theme of good and evil both on an interpersonal and personal level and looks at the issue of consequences for our actions The camera work is snazzy and the dialogue humorous With Bryan Brown who plays Pando and Heath Ledger as Jimmy battling it out onscreen in the most bizarre situations  this Aussie film is certainly not short of acting talent This subtle actioncomedy has become somewhat of a cult favourite and one of mine also
1,I was mighty impressed with Nurse Betty all the way through It has a great ensemble of characters an origional plot and an ending I shoulda seen coming but didnt and pulls at your heart strings If theres any one thing about this movie that got me the most it was Morgan Freeman and Chris Rocks interaction These two are great and it warms my heart to see Rock isnt going to do crappy Big Hollywood fare like Lethal Weapon 4 for the rest of his life Freeman is as always the man really there shouldnt be any need to critique his work anymore Hell Kiss the Girls was watchable with him in it Renee Zellwegger does the best she can with her role and Kinnear is good as her obession Sweet movie with a nice touch of gratuitous violence in it to satisfy the bloodlust of the male 9 outa 10 
1,Michelle Pfeiffer stars as a mob widow who seeks a normal life but has her hands full with the new boss and an undercover agent A lighthearted Demme film with some good laughs and Pfeiffer in a comical role that she has fun withon a scale of one to ten8
1,This is one of my favorite James bond in games because The missions are fun to play they have lots of action in them they can be hard that makes them fun to do the weapons you use are good The way James bond look in this James bond games is pretty you can see pierce brosnan in him which is cool and all the other characters in this game look like the actors that played them in the movie There is no way that you cant have a good time playing this game i loved itAlso the game follows the movie pretty much maybe a few added thing but it pretty much follows the movie Also the this James bond game has pretty good graphics for Nintendo 64 and to bad there was no voice over actors in this game but who care as long as the game is fun to play Overall score  out of 
1,hi Blade is an sensational action movie  the hero Wesley Snipes and the villain have done justice to their roles The movies action sequences are better then Matrix  Wesley Snipes is one the best action heroes ever If u like actionvampire movies  this is the ONE the theme is pretty good considering the fact that so many vampire movies have been made beforeBut these is the best of them Enjoy the Ride
1,I bought this movie just to see Bam because i was really loving him but after seeing this i dont like him much I mean his acting was good and everything i guess but whenever it showed the totally unnecessary skate scenes i was just saying to myself Alright we know youre a professional skateboarder now can we get back to Ryan Dunn Dunn Rake and Brandon really made the movie in my perspective I noticed that Jenn Rivell obviously and Missy Rothstein were both in Haggard but who Bam was dating at the time Anyways i actually enjoyed Haggard and i think its really like no other movie ive ever seen Its sort of in its own category
1,With its rerelease by ADV Films Ive had a chance to watch The Giant Majin for the first time without the deep cuts and unkind words of a late night Horror Chiller Theaters Guess what Its a pretty damn good movie The sets are authentic the acting in subdued and believable and the giant Majin is stately powerful and unstopable I loved the subtle fantasy touches the enchanted wood luck charm etc and the potrayal of the god as a little less than good This movie is begging for a remake in the new century
1,I absolutely hate the idea of made for television films  For me TVMs usually involve Jane Seymour or Jaclyn Smith as the mother of a sick child who is dying of a difficult to treat disease all done in such a sugary manner that the audience doesnt need tissues it needs insulin  So when DEADLY VOYAGE a made for TV film by the BBC and HBO based on a true story I vaguely remembered from a couple of years previously turned up on the TV schedules I sat down waiting to be bored senseless  I was surprised No strike that last sentence  I wasnt surprised I was shocked  Here is a TVM that grips you tighter than a great white shark  in fact DEADLY VOYAGE doesnt deserve to be relegated to the TV schedules it should have been made and distributed by a top Hollywood film company due its absolutely terrifying premise and whats more its  unlike PAPILLON and SLEEPERS  completely true  For those who dont know the story  POSSIBLE SPOILERS AS TO PLOT  sometime in the early 90s a bunch of Africans stowed away on an Ukrainian freight ship bound for France in order to work there Of course it was an attempt at illegal immigration but the crew of the freighter had already been fined for allowing illegal immigrants onto their ship from a previous journey and not wanting to get into anymore trouble with maritime and immigration authorities the crew murder the Africans after discovering them hiding in the hold All except one African  Kingsley Ofusu  who manages to escape from the firing squad but who must try and survive aboard the ship  but the problem is the crew are hunting him and France is still several days voyage away  Just typing the above paragraph reminds of how good DEADLY VOYAGE is  What a remarkable story  and once again it is  unlike many stories that claim to be  totally true  Its very well written  directed and acted  especially by Sean Pertwee  Why isnt that guy a big name star    and most of all its a tense claustrophobic disturbing thriller that I can still remember vividly six years after seeing it for the one and only time  I look forward to seeing again  But youve got to ask yourself how can a TVM be better than most of the Hollywood action blockbusters that came out round about the same time  Oh hold on  Ive just had a disturbing thought about Jerry Bruickhiemer doing a remake with Tony Scott directing and with Denzil Washington playing Kingsley  Brad Pitt playing Pertwees role  massive artistic licence taken with events etc Lets keep DEADLY VOYAGE a superlative TVM rather than a poor blockbuster
1,taking into consideration the Chan films that would follow this isnt bad Plenty of stereotypes beginning with the Black man in the beginning and when the police captain orders that every Hindu in town by roundedup A parade of stereotypical characters enter the scene including Shemp of the Three Stooges Charlie seems to move quickly around the city going from Sutton Pl to the W Village in a flashThe ending is silly An obvious toy airplane is used as it climbs through the sky and then nose dives Ed Wood couldnt have done it better The final scene is absurd as the murderer will obviously incriminate himself in his attempt to quiet the one person who knows his identity Overall it is worth watching
1,This is an enjoyable project that is not a film as the title suggests Good performance by Nadia Dajani who reenacts the role of Grace I follows the reenactment of what happens to Mike and Grace in New York City She leaves but he wants to get in contact with her This project is his way of trying to getting in touch with her I saw it on IFC I have heard that it will be released on DVD as well I do like this trend of more independent projects This is an example of a good project I hope that he finds her Take a look and be entertained KirbyEF
1,HBO created this show for purposes of making us see the most realistic view of prison possible and they did a hell of a job Oz was created by the creators of Homicide who wanted to show a raw version of prison This show is what launched the idea of every other HBO Original Program such as The Sopranos Sex and the City The Wire Arliss Deadwood and Six Feet Under amongst others Oz is the nickname for the Oswald State Penetentiary a fictional prison in some US state which is never stated Though with the accents crime scenes and racial distribution NY is assumed The main prison unit looked at on the show is Emerald City a seemingly ideal prison unit with more privlages than others thought out by a liberal unit manager named Tim McManus Overall this show shows us what it is really like if one wishes to survive in prison There are about 10 gangs shown on Oz First we have the Muslims a group of blacks who wish to destroy the injustices of the criminal justice system and help improve living conditions for blacks everywhere They are led by Kareem Said a black militant minister who wishes to destroy everything racist about the judicial system As a group they are not so much antiwhite but rather antiinjustice Our second group of blacks is the Homeboys who are essentially the street blacks who wish to keep all the bad ghetto behaviors up and run the drug trade Their leadership varies mainly because they are always losing members due to violence In this group one character who is acted terrifically is Simon Adebisi Adebisi is an African inmate who is essentially the most frighteningly evil character alive This gang as a whole gets side help from the Irish at times and is always in conflict with the Latinos and Sicilians for drug distribution purposes Being that Oz is mostly black the Homeboys have the most soldiers of any gang inside The Latinos and Sicilians like the Homeboys have varying leadership due to violent deaths that occur throughout the show The Sicilians pretty much have the most substantial say in how any illegal activity gets conducted in Oz The Latinos make their presence known so that they can at least be coasting well if they are not in control Unlike the Homeboys however these gangs do not have as much internal battle for power and are usually more stable when it comes to drug usage The Irish who are mentioned above are a smaller gang led by a manipulative and snakelike Ryan OReily OReily always manages to stay in good graces with all the drug powers and manages to manipulate things in his way whenever he wants They are in no illegal control but they are at least on good terms with all those who are Amongst the whiter inmates we have the Bikers and Aryans The Bikers are merely a bunch of tattooed drug users who help the Aryans out most of the time The Aryans are the most hated and hateful gang to most any viewer of Oz They are led by Vern Schillinger who is amongst the most racist sickest and sadistic characters one will ever see Both gangs control nothing illegal they just merely let the darker skinned inmates see that they are a substantial threat to anyone who thinks all white inmates are soft We also have the Others The Others is a gang of outsider prisoners who are not necessarily a problem to any other inmate In this group we see Tobias Beecher a lawyer who accidentally killed a young girl whose life is forever altered by prison We also see Augustus Hill a black man bound to a wheelchair for killing a police officer who narrates the show and introduces the audience to every inmate The characters crimes are shown as they are introduced and Augustus lets us know how long they will be in prison Finally amongst gangs there are the Christians and Gays The Christians merely stay religious to keep from going mental and the Gays are a bunch of crossdressers who are often raped by other inmates This show gets in depth on a lot of issues dealing with the criminal justice system and is more explicit than any movie about prison Since language is unedited we here more racial epithets and cuss words than we would on any other TV show Augustus Hills commentary provides a good way for us to truly understand each and every issue involved with Oz This show as good as it is is not at all for the light to medium hearted It explicitly shows drug use and distribution by any means possible prison rape murders fatal stabbings and general gore than anything anyone else has seen In my opinion it is the most influential and greatest show ever created but I can see at the same time why other people would be disturbed by this show If you are at all interested by shows and movies about prison Oz is a must see
1,I saw this film as a kid about 30 years ago and I havent forgotten it to this day I couldnt say whether its a good picture But in those days I instantly fell in love with Jean Simmons The memories concentrate on the very erotic feel of the movie but I still remember the plot Simmons was very young then and there is another film that gave me the same feeling David Leans GREAT EXPECTATIONS And again it was the young Jean Simmons Its a pity that BLUE LAGOON is not available on video Id like to correct my memories
1,Though its a Christmas movie Christmas in Connecticut could have been done any time of year as its the story of a soldier who spends what is to be an idyllic time with a Martha Stewart type Thats what he thinks In reality the lady in question portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck has a popular magazine column about life on a farm with her husband and baby She has no farm no husband and no baby nor are the many recipes she publishes hers They belong to the restaurant owner nearby When her nononsense editor Sydney Greenstreet insists that she entertain soldier Dennis Morgan she enlists the aid of her boyfriend to use his farm and she transports herself and the restaurateur there Theres even a babywell actually theres more than one Chaos ensues and the charade becomes increasingly difficult to play out especially when Stanwyck falls in love with Morgan This is such a wonderful movie and even if youre gravely depressed Christmas in Connecticut can lift you right out of it Barbara Stanwyck is wonderful as the career woman turned homemaker Despite not being as flashy as Crawford or Davis she was nevertheless able to do what any role called for  she could be cheap elegant warm nasty cold andor sexy and she makes it look easy On top of that she is always attractive and alluring Dennis Morgan is a handsome and charming solider as an added bonus he gets to use his Irish tenor Fiancé Reginald Gardner is all business and you can tell hes not quite right for Stanwyck SZ Sakall as the fake unclereal chef is hilarious especially as he prays Stanwyck can flip a pancake before an audience I can imagine the impact this delightful film had at the tail end of World War II It must have been a real beacon for the better times to come
1,This movie caught me by surprise For years I have avoided many of Harold Lloyds sound pictures as well as those of Keaton because they have a generally welldeserved reputation for being lousy compared to the silent films because the basic formula has been lost However when I saw this film I was pleasantly surprised to find I actually liked itonce I accepted it really was not a Harold Lloyd film despite him starring in it This is because although it is nothing like the style of his earlier films it IS highly original and Lloyd isnt bad playing a totally different type of character As I mentioned above the formula of the old films is almost completely missing here Lloyd does not do the old familiar stunt work the romance is quite unlike his early screen romances and the plot is just plain weird Instead of the usual roles he is the son of a Chinese missionary who returns to America for the first time since he was a small boy Because of this though he looks like an American except for his white suit and explorers helmet he thinks and acts a lot like someone who is Chinese In many ways hes very naive about America and is like an innocent among wolves Early on he meets a man who turns out to be a local party boss This boss ALWAYS produces a losing candidate for the mayoral racebecause he is bought and paid for by the corrupt mayor to produce a token candidate who has NO CHANCE of winning Well the old geezer who they traditionally run for office just died and he decides to run the naive Lloydhe hasnt a prayer of winning Well the unthinkable happens and Lloyd wins This and Lloyds decision to clean up the town greatly upsets the old political machine and they stop at nothing to destroy honest Lloyd Just when it appears Lloyd is headed to jail on a trumped up corruption charge he creates a scheme that is 100 impossible and very illegal to get signed confessions from the crooks However despite this it is incredibly funny and a great ending So my advice is at the end just suspend disbelief and enjoy An important note This movie is definitely NOT politically correct The word Chink is used repeatedly I found it offensive but considering the times I ignored it as you should too If however you are someone who CANT and like being angry I suggest you never watch movies anywayas you are bound to become offended again and again
1,Years ago when I first read John Irvings The World According to Garp I was astounded that most of the younger adults with whom I had contact didnt like the book when I loved it I began to understand that it was an age and experience thing I experienced somewhat of a déjà vu when reading some of the comments on this site that were clearly written by younger viewers Fully enjoying Separate Lies is surely an age and experience thing In this film the viewer sees a seemingly happy upper middle class couple  he a successful lawyer  she the perfect wife of a successful lawyer They have a townhouse in London and a home in the country Alls well until there enters the villain in the guise of the son of the richest man in the village This guy appears to be a cad from the word Go He is disdainful of everyone and everything including his own children In the traditional form of nice guys finishing last the lawyers wife engages in an affair with the bounder You see the lawyer really is a nice guy but with the marriage killing trait of an organized perfectionist Even though he truly loves her he is boring his wife to death The bad boy is far more exciting All of this is entangled with the hitandrun death of a man in the village in which all the facts point to the cad being the driver of the vehicle Its easy to determine that this movie doesnt build to a happy ending however it does lead to a very satisfying ending in that the man and his wife learn and grow from their experiences and probably will be able to conduct their personal lives in a more successful manner Three excellent actors play the main characters in this film and it is there performances that make the whole thing a pleasure to watch Tom Wilkinson is perfect as the husband His portrayal shows us a kind man who has so much control over his emotions that he has lost touch with the world Emily Watson shows us a woman who has become so trapped in the role of perfect wife that she has almost lost her knowledge of passion That passion is reborn by the character deftly played by Rupert Everett If you have reached that point in life in which you understand that everyone has feet of clay and that everyone  even with the gifts of intelligence and opportunities  makes many many wrong decisions then you will probably enjoy watching these excellent actors creating the lives of three such people This is a beautifully acted and directed adult film about realistic adults
1,The English Patient is a love story set in Europe as World War II ends It is a wartime romance mystery epic like Hiroshima Mon Amour The Sweet Hereafter and After Life Anthony Minghella weaves extravagant beauty around a central character whose condition is grotesque and puts emotional barriers between the characters and the audience This adult love story is an intimate portrait in the tradition of Casablanca and Dr Zhivago The film sweeps gracefully attaining a level of eroticism and emotional connection that many similar films had missed Told in flashback it is a masterpiece of intimate moment and spectacular largesse Ralph Fiennes plays the English patient Count Laszlo de Almasy a Hungarian cartographer of few words who works for the British government and is stationed in the North African desert Count Laszlo is the unidentified survivor of a plane crash turned over to the Allies taken into custody by a medical convoy in Italy and essentially left to die in peace in an isolated monastery in Tuscany under the care of an inspiring pretty nurse who injects him with morphine and reads to him a book considered his great treasure and his one surviving possession Hana seeks to stimulate his touching memories wrapped up in his head released in lost pieces from his disturbed mind Fiennes gives a haunted pained performance playing the young man whose veneer of charm cannot plainly cover his hearts capacity for passion He makes us sympathize with the character in showing selfdoubt and weakness As a badly burned man he has only cherished memories His joy and heartbreak are completely clear and visible in his eyes He remembers falling under the spell of an attractive English married woman He remembers the way this turns him from a harsh abrupt wanderer into a man willing to betray everything for love His tragic love affair forms the heart of the motion picture Kristin Scott Thomas matches Fiennes work with a radiant sensuality She is captivating as the married European woman conveying the audience with the energy and enthusiasm for life that the Count finds irresistible Their different world despairing and hopeful menacing and resilient is simply beautiful With intense passion and intelligence this attractive blonde burns the screen as the different wife Juliette Binoche seems to shine as the FrenchCanadian nurse full of life and energy This vibrant young woman has a heart of gold kissing wounded soldiers but she thinks that she is a curse as anybody she ever loved tends to die on her Colin Firth is good as Katherines husband He is a British spy flying into the tough desert in a yellow biplane to take aerial maps of the whole North African continent He quickly becomes friend of the Count yet when he realizes that his wife has committed adultery his face reflected a peaceful fury William Dafoe plays a doubleagent spy who covers his anger with a strange charm He is a crippled war veteran who has a hidden agenda This cunning Canadian man seems to know of some dark secret in Almasys past He believes the English patient is partially responsible for the mutilation of his hands and is busy seeking revenge on everyone even remotely involved Naveen Andrews is Hanas ardent lover He is a handsome Sikh and an explosives expert with a dangerous job Theres a scene that is stuck in my head because it literally had me on the edge of my seat for what seemed an eternity In this particular scene the military sapper has to cut the wires on a bomb that has been hidden on a bridge Its on a timer and he only has a few minutes left The scene cuts back and forth between his tense face the wires and his dirty fingers as they try madly to figure out how to untangle and cut the wires without detonating the bomb  All the conventional elements of the genre are at peaks of excellence in The English Patient John Seales cinematography is breathtaking and Gabriel Yareds majestic music is dreamy and romantic This is a rich motion picture with ambition and style a fever dream lyrical and complex We are almost able to feel the heat of the desert the pain of the burnings the intimate flush of humanity that becomes the most haunting element of this epic love story
1,Crossing the Bridge the Sound of Istanbul received one of the most rapturous applause from the audience when it ended and very deservingly so I did not expect too much from a musical documentary but the movie proved to be much more than that It was also a visual documentary of Istanbul with stark contrasts of old and new western and eastern poor and rich modern and traditional Black and white photographs of old Istanbul by world famous Armenian photographer Ara Guler were exceptional But of course main theme was music and by God what a variety of it It was in a way similar to Bueno Vistas Social Club the love and the respect of the interviewer Alexander Hacke here replacing Ray Cooder for the musicians exuded from the screen and engulfed us all The music was mostly very interesting The jazz session by a group of Romany gypsies in a small Western Turkish town was mind blowing I will not be surprised if the travel agents start getting group booking requests for Kesan after the movie is released But I most loved Muzeyyen Senar who looked amazingly elegant in a sort of burlesque way and whilst tipping her Raki declared courageously My voice and I are 86 years old Well done Faith Akin I bet there are many more Turkish musicians who are feeling left out Go for Volume II please
1,Not high art not even exceptionally innovative but a thoroughly enjoyable movie Funny fresh intelligent  there are still people out there who dont need millions of dollars to hide that theyre out of ideas When you compare this to your average Hollywood action flick youre comparing a homemade meal with a big mac
1,My wife and I saw this when we were 17 The only good thing my father ever did get us in This is our movie and the music is our songs Michelles song is our song Yeah nowadays its a crime to show naked children on the screen but we were screwing at 16 why not these kids The movie is rich boy impregnates poor girl then rich dad steals him away from her at the end after she gives birth under impoverished conditions She is left alone with child It is a love story and a growing up story The music is fantastic and the story is one any person could relate to May be someday this will be released on DVD
1,Gargle with old razor blades Can I help it if Im not cousin Basil I think the pianos out of tune Ginger Grey This is your little snookums Laughs throughout the entire 20 minute short as the boys spoof gold diggers and opera singers They even manage to show us how to properly demonstrate to some attractive ladies how to handle both a rifle and a bear trap Wonder how many times they rehearsed the scene with the phone booth Adding Christine McIntyre and Emil Sitka 2 frequent collaborators to the mix makes it even better Only Vernon Dent is missing The Stooges did some great individual scenes but this was their best overall
1,If Western Union isnt exactly the real story of the construction of the Transcontinental Telegraph it certainly does capture the spirit and dedication of the people involved with the project Dean Jagger is the man in charge and one fine day hes thrown from a horse and sustains some fractured ribs An outlaw on the run Randolph Scott finds Jagger and is ready to steal his horse but changes his mind and brings Jagger to help Later on hes hired by Western Union and works for Jagger Jagger also hires a young easterner played by Robert Young whos an engineer Young is doing one of his few loan out films away from MGM for 20th Century Fox Both Young and Scott become friends but rivals for Jaggers sister Virginia Gilmore Western Union has plenty of action enough to satisfy any western fans The telegraph crew has to deal with outlaws Indians and your garden variety labor troubles Slim Summerville as the timid cook and Victor Killian as the frontier character assigned to guard him have some of the funniest scenes They both provide some good comic relief  Fritz Lang got good performances from his cast and kept the film moving briskly along Western Union is solid western entertainment
1,Brought Philip Larkin to life in a way that is worthy of the greatest performances of all time and not just the ones that are measured by popularity It shows a stark portrayal of Larkins life as the greatest unrecognized poet of his era  which is exactly how he would have wanted it such was his disdain for cankers and medallions It dramatically exposes the raw beauty in the intense sadness of Philips observations of our relationship with our own mortality and lays it our in a way that seems to have missed even the great philosophers for anyone interested in profound observations of our relationship with life love and death this is a must
1,This film is what most of the industry has forgotten how to make FAMILY entertainment meaning something which is enjoyable to people of all ages This particular Wallace  Gromit can be enjoyed by everyone from toddlers who like the colors and cute bunnies to their grandparents who understand the adult references  This film has direction as good as any Ive ever seen and I mean that literally It is also packed with tiny bits of humor and each scene has so many humorous details in the background that Im going to have to buy it if only in order to read all the signs and handbills in W  Gs world  I plan to see this movie at least twice more in theaters then buy it on DVD You too should see it
1,I recently got THE SEVENUPS on video and I must say it was a very enjoyable movie Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco are great as the cop and crook respectively and a young Richard Lynch is great as psycho henchman Moon The late Bill Hickman is pretty good as his associate Bo and sets up a brilliant car chase sequence which will have you on the edge of your seats The other three members of the SevenUps team are pretty bland but thats only to be expected Im glad that a lot of people on this site have supported this movie I think it should be a film that should be released on DVD and not just forgotten I certainly enjoyed every minute of it The final scene between the two leads is excellent as the bad guy must face the consequences of his actions THE SEVENUPS does not disappoint
1,Not all movies are Oscar worthy but lets face it sometimes these types of movies are more fun to watch and leave a longer and lasting impression This one left me smiling and happy and I couldnt wait to hug my own son Anyone who has had a pet no matter what type knows what it feels like to lose one I believe most people would identify with Buddy almost losing his best friend who he raised from birth Bruce Willis was great as the tycoon turned nice guy and Joey Lauren Adams was convincing as a good mother The little boy who played Buddy had a cherub face and his sister and friend Edgar played terrific backup roles Liked the movie a lot and it was something the whole family could enjoy Thanks
1,As a cuspprebabyboomerborn in 1944 IN Los Angeles thereby having the dubious distinction of having been alive while Hitler was still actively involved in his Last Great Offensive but also with our President Roosevelt still actively fighting the offensivethis was one of the most important first films of my young life Having the opportunity to see it in rerelease several years after the 1946 opening a common studio custom in those years answered even to my very young mindohso many questions I hadbeing surrounded by our returning Vet heroes Ensconced in all the many of William Wylers equanimity of subtle multiplotsintentionally NOT surrounding mini or sub plotsin all their colors and shades of intensitydid more than anything else I can recall to provide to me some semblance of reason and rational explanation of what had been going on all around mein REAL life My personal experience perchance being a new and different angle when looking at this classic film
1,It was a terrific movie I like to watch it again and again The actors were awesome The movie kept me on the edge of my seat I would recommend this movie to anyone I wish Lifetime would put this movie on DVD I would most definitely purchase a copy This movie just proves that you should be very careful about who you get hooked up with You may think you know someone but you never know My daughter watched the movie with me She thought it was great All I know is I will watch this movie every time Lifetime airs it Its the kind of movie that keeps you glued to the tvI wish Lifetime would redo the movie but use the same actors and bring it to the big screen
1,Im from Ireland and I thought this film had the odd minute or two where accents where a little off but no worse than any Brad Pitt or other American doing the accent Furthermore I have rarely seen any British actor handle an American or Canadian accent except for Colin Farrel in Minority Report This film is a little film and it was entertaining No it wasnt a Blockbuster Hollywood production but frankly Im sick of that shite I laughed more than a few times and had a good time It was definitely worth the rental The main character is a spoof on other hard British gangsters At least thats the way I saw it If you go in expecting a 100 million dollar production youll be disappointed Enjoy it for what it is a small entertaining film
1,A few years ago I saw this remake of the sixties classic with the Mini Coopers for the first time and I remember liking it a lot Now about two years later it was shown on television and I just wanted to know whether I would still like it as much as when I saw it in the cinema Well the answer is yes The movie is about a team of robbers that will do one final job in Venice Italy The plan is flawless and the execution perfect They escape and wont have to work for the rest of their lives But there is one problem they didnt take into account Someone within their own ranks doesnt like to split the loot but wants to keep it all for himself even when that means he will have to kill the rest of the crew But all but one survive and they are out for revenge One year later in Los Angeles this time the surviving team members create a smart and devious plan to steal back the gold and get their revenge on the traitor The story on itself is of course not very original since this is a remake of the original 1969 movie but it has plenty of goodies to offer to make you forget about that This is a typical heist  action movie but it certainly is one of the better ones in its kind The action is very nice the landscapes and Venice are real eyecandy the story is OK and the special effects are stunning Even the acting is very good something which youll not often see in an action movie I must admit that I really liked what I saw and I give this movie a well deserved 7510
1,Okay Heres the thing Ive read through the comments of other viewers  some trashing the film and some saying its the funniest darkest blackest comedy ever made Whiffs of Tarantino etc Well not exactly But guess what Its still an enjoyable and ultimately funny film Not brilliant not trash Liv Tyler gives a great performance and you absolutely cannot take your eyes off her Shes a woman with very strong decorating ideasMatt Dillon a greatly underrated and underused actor is wonderful as ever He always manages to stride that delicate line between scruff and soul and he pulls off the comedy beautifully Ditto John Goodman though the religious overtones probably funny in the script really dont work Paul Reiser is very good  definitely better than he was on TV The usually unbearable Michael Douglas is actually great in this role As for his coif well see the film Between this and Wonder Boys youre actually reminded of the fact that Douglas can act The movie will make you laugh in parts Okay not exactly bellylaughing but definitely in the ImamusedImveryamused category If youre renting this expecting to see another Pulp Fiction forget it But if want something kinda hip and kinda fun this is a damned good choice
1,Ok when I rented this several years ago I had the worst expectations Yes the acting isnt great and the picture itself looks dated but as I sat there a strange thing happened I started to like it The action is great and there are few scenes that make you jump Brion James maybe one of the greatest Bgrade actors next to Bruce Campbell is great as always The story isnt bad either Now I wouldnt rush out and buy it but you wont waste your time at least watching this good bgrade post apocalyptic western
1,NORTHFORK is above all a masterpiece of widescreen cinematography For this alone the film is well worth ones time The stark wide open plains and badlands of eastern Montana are captured in the spare muted earth tones of autumn or early spring The gigantic grey cement Fort Peck Dam is the films protagonist The film comments both subtly and not so subtly on about a dozen issues of Western Landscape The dialogue can be trying at times yet the images and concepts are powerful enough to lift the film The 1950s period works so well here and is executed so well I think that the passing years will be kind to this film
1,BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience In the tradition of all good animal centered thrillers ie Jaws The Edge the original Cat People the directors know that restraint and what isnt shown are the best ways to pack a punch The performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous If you are after a Bgrade gore fest croc romp forget Black Water but if you want a clever suspenseful ride that will have you fearing the water and wondering what the hell would I do if i was up that tree then its a must see
1,Overall the Dads Army movie is very funny although the humour isnt quite as catchy and sparkly as in the TV and radio series So where does this leave us the viewers If youve never seen Dads Army then the movie is a good way of bringing yourself up to speed and getting hooked on the mad world of Walmington oS The downside is that you might not get it because as I said the humour in the movie is a bit on the stolid side For Dads Army buffs the movie holds nothing new as the story is more or less a cutup of the TV series but its a unique chance of seeing your favourites in high def as compared to the shitty quality of the BBC video recordings The movie also features what must be the lamest holdup sequence in the history of the universe I cant make up my mind if thats a positive or a negative though
1,As a great fan of the Hammer Studios and enthusiastic watcher of their Gothic Horror films I wonder what took me so long to start watching their TVseries Hammer House of Horror which only ran for one season in 1980 Now that Ive seen the first four episodes of the show I can say that it easily satisfies my expectations so far While this first episode Witching Time is maybe not the most imaginative Horror story ever told and doesnt quite deliver the marvelous Gothic atmosphere that I love Hammers films from the 50s to the 70s for it doubtlessly does accomplish to tell a surprisingly spooky tale and create some genuine creepiness within fifty minutes Film score composer David Winter Jon Finch is tormented by the 17th century witch Lucinda Patricia Quinn While he story may be simple but for a running time of less than an hour it is effective and delivers many creepy moments Northern Irish actress Patricia Quinn who is probably best known for her role in The Rocky Horror Picture Show 1975 as well as the fantastic Monty Python comedy Monty Pythons Meaning of Life 1983 is wonderfully malicious in her role which fits her like a glove Jon Finch is also quite good as David and while Prunella Gee who plays his adulterous actress wife may not be the best actress ever she is definitely nice to look at The episode is accompanied by a nice score which plays along well with the atmosphere Overall Witching Time is a very entertaining episode with several truly creepy moments and decent opener to the series
1,and this movie easily exceeded my expectations The fact that it is written and directed by Peter Dalle led me to believe it was in style with other films Im used to and bored with seeing him in Anyway I grudgingly went along to see this flick and that Im glad for This stuff has humour and depth 9 out of 10 See it
1,The story is quite slow at the beginning except few interesting humour that come along the way but some of the plot still empty The science on how the kid entered the 21st century is still a mystery except at the end of the movie we have been shown of how Other than that everything looks ok
1,The film is excellent One of the most noteworthy things about it is that Flynns performance is superb This is worth stressing as he was often derided as an actor by Bette Davis et al I remember the scene where Flynn gets Arthur Kennedy drunk in order to take him to his doom at the Battle of the Little Big Horn The cold calculating look on Flynns face as he does so is extraordinary  much better than the much vaunted Spencer Tracy or many other stars could have done The other thing to note is the excellent performance by George P Huntley Jr as Lt Queens Own Butler It is baffling why he stopped making films shortly afterwards  one would have thought that he would have been set up for years after as a character actor
1,While the songs and dance numbers in general arent as strong as many would have them be the films storyline and message are still there and ring out loudly above the simple 70sstyle musical numbers  Keeping in mind that this film was made after the Hollywood Musical had nearly died out with few exceptions being rock musicals the audiences that went to see it new didnt appreciate the fact that it was a brave attempt at something that hadnt been done to date Audiences that see it today will tend to judge it against the films and musicals of today and perhaps the huge allstar casts of musicals gone past But to do that to this film or any for that matter is an injustice to the film itself There are some good musical moments in the film The first is that of Bobby Van Mr Van took his role of Harry Lovett just after closing a 2 year Tony nominated for best actor run of the Broadway revival No No Nanette He is a songanddanceman from way back and honestly the only one in the cast that was truly talented and experienced for musicals He never misses a step in his Question Me An Answer and rightly so  he was totally at home as Harry Other pleasant numbers are done by Olivia Hussey when she welcomes the new visitors and while the lyrics are weak James Shigeta shows his strong voice in the Family song as well as a nicely done staging of the full piece View the film for what it is  a fantasy about a place where you never grow old hidden in the ice and snow covered mountains of Tibet found by a group of unsuspecting modernday people wrapped up in the strife of any modern culture Take this and compare it to reality and you get a film that falls short of a goal But  take this film for the message of love and peace and tranquility and brotherly love and you get a warm and refreshing message and a positive one at that To some this film may seem corny to others a welcomed release from the hectic pace of reality To the first try to not judge and just enjoy the message To the second you have discovered the secret of ShangriLa
1,I never heard of Mishima before I watched this film and although parts of it are a little tedious I still find myself drawn to watch it when it is repeated on the box At the beginning of the film we are told about a celebrated Japanese writer behaves like a lunatic and commits seppuku in public As the film progresses you are gently inducted into twisted logic of Mishimas mind The stages of his life are are presented in four chapters Each chapter itself is a blend of two contrasting narratives the first continues the story with scenes from Mishimas life and appear in black and white The second narrative is an adaptation of scenes from a novel and these are staged like a play and filmed in vivid colours There is a different novel staged in each chapter Between each chapter the narrative returns to the present as Mishima proceeds towards his eventual ritual suicide This means that the drama and tension is maintained until the end I suspect that many people will find this film to be boring pretentious and arthouse I respect that this is not a film for people who want action and a strong story line If on the other hand you are the kind of person who relishes the opportunity to penetrate the mind a bizarre man while watching his life story told in collage of beautiful pictures set to music by Philip Glass you will love it I loved it 
1,I really refused to see this movie I refused to go with the school and I refused to go with my parents Just by looking at the trailer it looked stupid to me anyway One of my friends wanted to take me to the movies that day and he offered me 2 choices The Dukes Of Hazzard or Wallace And Gromit The Curse Of The WereRabbit It took me 17 minutes to decide Time was running out I had to choose It came up on the screen Few as in a few tickets left By the time we had to line up and get our ticket only one of us could go in I desperately wanted Nicholas to go in to see it But he forced me I crossed my arms and was very moody and disappointed that I was going in to see this childishness I walked in sat in the only seat that was available and prepared for the movie must say I was very surprised that I sat through that MASTERPIECE It was amazing I dont know what I was complaining about The Clay Animation was by far the most best ive ever seen in my life The story was brilliant About a rabbit disrupting and crashing a carnival that had been planned for over 500 years Basically Anti Pest Control are protecting the people who are competing in the Vegetable Competition Anti Pesto known as Wallace And Gromit Who are in charge of this business try to keep all the rabbits away from the Vegetable carnival I wont say anymore Its just too good to tell Ill admit that the whole idea of a WereRabbit is abit unbelievable and abit childish but Nick Park adds substance to it which what makes everyone love it I mean there wont be a 10 foot rabbit on the loose and there definitely wont be 8 foot werewolves as said in  Dog Soldiers Then again WereRabbits and WereWolves arent actual creatures But either way it worked out very well  The jokes also were more grown up The kids wont get some of the jokes It goes way above their heads It had a lot of British jokes in there If you love British humor this is the movie for you I also loved the cast and the voices Everything about the movie is so incredibly well done The direction and pacing was absolutelyFANTASTIC I recommend this to fans of the old Wallace And Gromit shorts And no I havent seen them yet and I recommend it to fans who liked Shrek and Shrek 2 and most importantly I recommend it to the people who love Clay Animation Cracking good movie 1010
1,The film is really good it doesnt use violence or sex etc to sell itself like other films but instead just uses a really decent plotbased on the original by Michael Caine and some great actors to make a fun action packed film which i thoroughly enjoyed One thing which made me enjoy this film even more was that it had some actors which i really like such as Edward Nortonwho i last saw in 26th hour which i enjoyed also Jason Stathamtransporter enjoyed that also and Seth Green who i think is great his role as Shawn Fannings roommate dubbed The Napster is hilarious and his hacking skills play a great part in the main heist which centres around a large traffic jam in LA The car chases are really decent and the high tech equipment used by the thieves is interesting and very impressive I havent seen the original so i cant really compare the too but i liked this a lot and would highly recommend this film to everyone it isnt a film where you need to like that specific genre it will suit everyone i felt good after this movie it had a really good ending and was overall really fun to watch I give it 810 Go watch it

1,Its easy to kill a monster but its hard to kill a human being Set in St Thomas Housing Project and Angola Prison in New Orleans Dead Man Walking is the true story of Helen Prejean Susan Sarandon a Louisiana nun Sister who befriended Matthew Poncelet Sean Penn a murderer and a rapist bound for a lethal injection machine for killing a teenage couple Sister Helen agrees to help the convict and to remain with him till the endan act never before attempted by a woman  At their first meeting Poncelet swears to the nun that his accomplice was the one who shot both of the kids and pleads her help for a new trial in order to convince the pardon board hearing to spare his life  The film challenges the audience to actually give some thought to the human consequences of the death penalty but gives voice to angry bereaved parents whose kids were shot stabbed raped and left in the woods to die alone  As Poncelets execution looms closer and closer his character is seen deceptively complex harboring doubts about the rightness of what they were doing to him In one moment we hear him sensitive asking for a lie detector test to let his mother know that he is innocent in another we see him furious playing the victim blaming the government drugs blacks the kids for being there Poncelet never understood that he has robbed the Percys and the Delacroixs so much giving them nothing but sorrow They are never going to see their children again never going to hold them to love them to laugh with them  In the scenes leading up to his execution the deathrow inmate drops his terrible facade and reveals his identity Luckily both Sarandon and Penn are here exceptionalcarrying out successfully an exquisite tangible harmony of souls When Sarandon was looking at Penn she was projecting compassionate eyes brimming with tears She asks him to visualize her as he dies I want the last thing you see in this world to be the face of lovein that moment we truly believed that shell be the face of love for him
1,I just discovered this film and love it Just the right mix of fast moving story entertaining characters hilarious moments but not overloaded with stupid jokes and fun performances by Kelsey Grammar Harry Dean Stanton Ron Schneider Rip Torn and more Buckman is especially good and I really enjoyed watching the guy who played Stapanick I also find it interesting that they used a real submarine the Pampanito for the running on top scenes and emulated it almost exactly for their sets The set decoration is really impressive if you do a digital tour of the Pampanito online and then compare it to scenes in the movie They did an excellent job on this film What a light entertaining and truly enjoyable movie
1,A mix of 70s drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line As Ive often said about this flick  if you dont get it  youre way lame Classic lines such as parapharsed Ive got this erection and it wont go away no matter how many times I do it Youre a nurse what can you give me for it Nurse replies all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring Great sound trackThe classic Hydes got nothing to hide Stays surprisingly close to the original plot  not that the original stays in the way of a joke Havent met anyone with an IQ over 115 that doesnt find it hysterical 
1,This Western was set in 1861 and had to do with the creation of the first transcontinental wireless lines that were laid by Western Union While nice guy Dean Jagger sporting lots of hair did his best to get this done there was a bad guy just waiting to undo this for his own selfish reasons So its up to either Randolph Scott or Robert Young to save the day This is certainly one of the better 1940s Westerns I have seen and it nearly garnered an 8it was that good However for the life of me I have no idea why Fritz Lang was assigned to direct this filmafter all he knew nothing about Westerns His forte was dramaand I guess this movie is a drama of sortsjust set in the old West Strange yes but it seemed to work out okay though I wonder how this great German director felt about being given this job As for the rest of the film its exceptionalwith vivid color great location shooting and very good acting As usual Randolph Scott put in another relaxed and realistic performance I was surprised though with Robert Young being also cast in the film but it was a good casting decisionhe was supposed to be a Harvardeducated Easterner When I saw Barton MacLane was also in the film I pretty much assumed hed be the baddie and my thoughts were well founded since he made a career out of playing jerks As for the script it seemed pretty ordinary for the most part but the final showdown between Scott and Barton MacLane was a lot better than Id hopedmaking this movie ending on a very high note
1,A beautiful filmJohn Garfields character is a distant relative of Les Miserabless Jean Valjean while detective Rains recalls Victor Hugos Javertthe ruthless arm of law Like in many films noirsthe city epitomizes evil whereas the country and the nature represents sanctuaryredemptionand a second chance for those whose life seems forever doomedBut even in the luminous daylightdanger may appear suddenlyas the excellent scene at the reservoir showsJohn Garfield an actor whoas Leonard Maltin points outshould be rediscoveredIve never been disappointed by any of his films except for his supporting part in gentlemans agreement  but it was not his faultgives a heartfelt sensitive performance and the audience sides with him as soon as he is unjustly accused the first sequence shows a rather unkind hypocrite personbut all his trials redeem him and how do we feel for him during the last scenes with detective RainsColorful characters grandma and the kids  add a lot of joie de vivre which is necessary Humor is also present in the strip poker game as the Dead End brats fleece a rich kid I recommend this movie
1,It would be unwise to judge that that either narrative or documentary to be more authentic than the other Both formats have an underlying form of fiction and are never a true reflection of reality as producers seek to reconstruct and narrate stories in their perspectives As both formats usually leaves some issues undiscussed due to complexities of subplots and screen time it denies viewers the opportunity to open up debates and to further investigate and construct the real truth Adding to the viewers inability to evaluate sources eg comparisons with written history and the logics behind arguments history may be open to distortion through narrative and documentary To most people documentary may be seen more truthful as it usually involves actual participants testimonies and reallife footages However these visuals are selected and edited to be arranged in a way that allows producers to present their version of realism to the viewers In The Real Buddy Holly Story Paul McCartney seeks to establish the Buddy Holly as remembered by family and friends and how Buddy had influence the rest of the music world The testimonies may have been distorted as memories may not be accurate and emotions have evolved to make a legend out of Buddy The documentary did make corrections to the film version and cover other events such as there were 3 members of Crickets and that Buddys music was actually heard outside of USA at that time he had to embark on a world tour However it did not go into deep discussion about what happened to Buddys wife after his death Criticism andor negative discussions may have been left out of the documentary as the producers seek to present a Buddy that the world should have remembered Eventually we dont manage to construct the whole truth as we only restrict ourselves to the past realties that the documentary tells us Personally I prefer a narrative film because it provides rich visual imageries which helps us to reconnect with the collective memory of that era It gives the audiences a more constructive structure of the story and this leads to better memory retention for the audiences when they retell the story There is also an element of flexibility which allows filmmakers to express their thoughts and views on certain issues In The Buddy Holly Story racial issues were highlighted and viewers can certainly relate to these issues with respect to current situations Moviegoers consistently seek to revisit certain emotions when watching a film and using these emotions audiences can choose to make personal connections with the applied meanings that a filmmaker wants to deliver In most stories people are more likely to selectively remember the struggles the inspirations and the way the story ends Through The Buddy Holly Story we do remember the struggles Buddy and the Crickets had how Maria had been a source of encouragement and that Buddy Holly was a great performer until the day he dies
1,On the whole one wishes this was a better film but it has enough flashes of intense power to make it worth while Peck made this film during the same period that he made The Gunfighter before he apparently decided he was a monument rather than an actor A pity He was a fine actor perfectly willing to tackle characters that were not very likable and to do them extremely well The character he plays here is driven and when necessary ruthless Given the mission the character has been assigned and the men with which to do it those characteristics are essential Without being a spoiler think of this film as an early grittier example of The Dirty Dozen genre  The dialog in this film is a bit ham handed but it is atmospheric and intense and definitely tells a story worth telling It contains good work by all the character actors and even Barbara Payton turns in a credible performance This one isnt often shown on television so your local video store may be the only place to find a copy Go ahead Devote an evening to it It is worth your time
1,Brian Keith as Cole Wlikerson and Richard Jaeckel as Wade Matlock make excellent villains They just love intimidating the locals in the most brutal way possible and sneer sexily at any suggestion that there might be a more humane way to achieve their ends Its a pity that goodygoody Glenn Ford gets in their way
1,Ive been looking forward to seeing this film ever since I first caught the trailer and Im so glad now that I have Its truly a wonderful film The actors are superb the writing is fresh and real the whole thing was just spoton I love James McAvoy in this and I cant wait to see him in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe movie this December Romola Garai is wonderful too Be sure to check her out in I Capture the Castle or Nicholas Nickleby two of my favorite films Overall I think I liked this movie because it didnt chicken out Its a difficult subject matter to tell a story about in that youre very likely to offend a lot of people or mess up and make it into some overlysentimentalsugarysweet love fest But they avoided doing that completely and instead made a film thats real honest and touching yes but never overthetop Very well done Amazingly well done Go out and see it and youll know exactly what I mean
1,I have just seen this delightful classic again after many years the next to last film directed by Henry Cornelius who died three years later at the age of only 45 the same age at which the films male star Larry Harvey was also to die in 1973 Three future directors were in the crew Jack Clayton Associate Producer Guy Green cinematographer and Clive Donner editor This film is based upon the autobiographical story Goodbye to Berlin by the wellknown British author Christopher Isherwood which was first turned into a play by John van Druten then made into this film then turned into a musical Cabaret and finally filmed as Cabaret which brought the amazing Liza Minelli to world attention with her voice which can shatter a glass at the distance of a mile Isherwood appears as a character in the film under his own name He was gay but in those days that was illegal and could land him in prison so he disguises his proclivities under the description of being what he calls a confirmed bachelor This is the key to his Platonic relationship with the wildly eccentric wacky promiscuous evercheerful and thoroughly unique character whom he calls Sally Bowles The portrait of Sally Bowles in this film is a tourdeforce by the young Julie Harris who sweeps every scene into a magical and captivating web of sparkling personal charm What a vehicle for an actress with plenty of charm of her own It is one of the great cinematic performances of the 1950s Isherwood is played to perfection by the young Lawrence Harvey in a finelyjudged performance which never allows the comedy to go over the edge and even the moments of farce bordering on slapstick remain somehow almost believable Larry is so funny at portraying a wimpish hypochondriac What an irony considering the total lack of hypochondria shown by his bravery and stoicism in the last year of his life as he died from terminal stomach cancer and behaved with such dignity and lack of complaint I knew him well in the last three years or so and he was a generous warm and modest person He adored his little girl Domino now alas also tragically deadThis film was his finest early performance to be followed by his spectacular work in Room at the Top 1959 Summer and Smoke 1961 and The Manchurian Candidate 1962 Larry was often undervalued in his lifetime because he was too handsome was often cast as a cad and glamour boys are not always accepted as good actors but many of the finest actresses played opposite him and they were in no doubt of his abilities and he was a strong lead in many of the most important films of his time If he had lived beyond middle age he would have gone from strength to strength and become a grand old man of the screen Sitting in his house in Hampstead one day he gave me a glass of his usual white wine from a huge barrel which he had brought from some foreign cellar I said he always gave me such delicious wine what was it He proudly answered that it was a Sancerre which he had chosen himself at the vineyard in France and had shipped over specially He then added with extreme wistfulness You know Ive been waiting for four years for someone to comment on it and ask me what it is and you are the first person who has ever done so What mattered to him was to be recognised for having taste in wineand his more glamorous friends had denied him that satisfaction In this film Anton Diffring gives a touching early performance as an earnest young man later he was to have to play Nazi officers far too much poor fellow and the young Shelley Winters plays a rich German Jewish girl in her usual noisy but effective manner but it was not too difficult as she was a noisy Jewish girl herself anyway This film has such an air of joie de vivre about it that it is pure delight
1,This is a gem of a film Slapstick violence aplenty Simon pegg and Green Spew A suspicious looking power plant and an incontrollable motorbike add to this stonker  If you havent seen this I can highly recommend it maybe not quite as good as bottom but not far short If you have never seen a man impaled by the nose on two hooks then what are you waiting for buy this film I didnt even see the twist at the end coming when it turns out that Ritchie and Eddie are both ghosts Feeb  1 boiled egg
1,I really like the show As a part of Greek Life I can say that some things are overexaggerated but overall its still pretty damn funny Rusty is a likable lead character his roommate is HILARIOUS and the entire cast is entertaining in their own rights I like that it focuses on individual situations as well as interpersonal relations with the organizations This show covers it all and they do it without cursing or anything else that bad how else could it be on ABC Family My favorites are Cappie of course Rustys roommate and pretty much all of Kappa Tau This show is a great launch pad for them and Im excited to see what doors this opens  Please renew this show next summer ABC Family Like I said love love LOVE it
1,Some TV programs continue into embarrassment my beloved XFiles comes to mind Ive been a fan of Dennis Farina since Crime Story another late lamented show Buddy Faro never had a chance The series had a good premise and great actors Its really really a shame
1,This small John Ford western with no stars but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces It has a documentarylike feel to it as it traces the journey West of a party of Mormons and it may be the most authentic looking of all Fords films its on par with The Sun Shines Bright which he made a couple of years later There is a plot of sorts a group of bank robbers join the wagon train at one point but the films dramatic highlights are almost incidental The splendid performances of Fords stock company Ben Johnson Harry Carey Jr Ward Bond Jane Darwell etc adds considerably to the films authenticity while the nearest the film gets to a fullbodied star performance is Joanne Drus Denver Dru was a much finer actress than she was ever given credit for as were Bond and Johnson who at least was finally awarded with the recognition of an Oscar for his work in The Last Picture Show As he said himself It couldnt have happened to a nicer fella Add Bert Glennons superb location photography and you have a genuine piece of Americana that couldnt have some from anyone other than Ford This is a film that truly honors Americas pioneers and is full of sentiment and feeling
1,No real plot no character development no Scorceselevel direction but seriously were you really expecting any of this The only thing that matters is that this flick is absolutely hilarious nearly on the same level as Borat Sure the ending drags a bit but if Borats cameo didnt crack you up you must be the worst batty boy in the history of batty boys Sacha Baron Cohen is possibly the greatest comedian ALIVE and here he gets more laughs than Jude Law on a nude beach I dare you not to laugh If you can pull the tenfoot pole out of your behind for an hour and a half and just enjoy some well timed and extremely stupid jokes in a stupid story about a stupid character see this stupid movie Youll be glad you did Keep it real
1,If youre interested in learning about the real side of spying this movie is for you Unlike 007 movies this shows how things really go down in the world of espionage Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn both give outstanding performances in this notsowellknown film Certainly worth watching
1,As Muppet movies go this is easily and clearly the best It features loads of cameos by big named comedic stars of the age a solid script and some great Disneyesque songs and blends them together in a culmination of the best display of Hensons talent The story is basic and the jokes are manyleveled in order to amuse both the adults and the kids to which this was marketed without exposing them to ideologies their parents may not find desirable This is simply fun but it is also a well made well written beautifully endearing classic It rates an 8910 from the Fiend 
1,Never posted anything here before but after watching Noroi I just felt that I had to write down my thoughts about it Firstly do not compare this to Blair Witch this movie deserves far better than that Simply put Noroi is probably one of the best horror movies I have ever seen and I have seen a lot I really liked how the movie presents itself not as a standard horror flick but as a documentary filmed by a reporter i think named Kobayashi and his cameraman Without spoiling to much about the plot I can say it that it starts with Kobayashi doing research on a series of seemingly unrelated events that turns out to be connected to something far more darker and sinister While the story might not be that original in itself what really hooked me with Noroi was the incredibly eerie atmosphere If youre looking for cheap scares and seatjumping scenes this movie might not be for you This movie is all about the mood it presents with haunting images and a general feeling of foreboding suspense The documentary style filming just makes it farm more believable This is also helped a lot by the acting which is superb although not perfect for the general part of the movie Far better than in most other movies in this type of genre Well enough ranting from me I highly recommend Noroi to everyone it is suspenseful creepy well acted and the first movie that has scared me in ages
1,This is a low budget stop motion monster movie from Brett A Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell Piper and it delivers just what Id expect from such a production lighthearted though cheesy dialogue some cute actresses and lots of stop motion critters Thats why Ive given the film 10 out of 10  because it delivers what I expected it to deliver and a bit more Brett doesnt pennypinch when it comes to putting his critters on screen He hurls lots of bugs at his cast for the finale And anyway I LOVE stop motion monsters which compared to CGI critters in bigger budgeted movies just seem to be that much fun to watch
1,On first viewing this movie seems to be some kind of fairy tale about a beautiful and significantly white horse once seen never forgotten However viewed strictly within the context of the story the implication is that to survive in the immediate postCivil War America one had to have a horse and not any old horse but a truly great one And Eagles Wing is such a horse But for a man to be worthy of such a horse is another matter Who should own it The Native American or the AWOL soldier The story throughout pits primitivism against civilisation As has been said by other commentators it is ironic that it took an English director to perceive this fact and then develop this simple theme into a western like no other youre ever likely to see again The film is basically about this beast and the savage harshness of the environment and the people who scrape a living from it The photography and the soundtrack are exquisite Martin Sheens performance is a revelation This film released in the same year as Sheens other great performance as Willard in Apocalypse Now hints at his abilities which somehow were never given such a free rein again Mores the pity A comparison of the two stories throws up the surprising similarities between them  not least that both films chart a mans journey into his soul in order to find redemption Whereas Willard is redeemed I will leave it to the viewer to decide if Pike is eventually The ending is fabulous in the true sense of the word and very moving be warned Altogether this is an extraordinary film
1,I really enjoy this movie The first time it was on Turner Classic Movies All the actors did very well but Brynner steals the show again like always  he is so sexyThis is one of the movie that you do see Brynners emotions Actually this movie this is the first I ever seen him laugh because he plays very strong largerthanlife and serious roles in other movies In this movie you see both a masculine tough and sensitive side of Brynner Brynner seems to be a ladiesman in this movieThat is amazing how Brynner eats the glass cup and speaks in his Russian tongue it drives me crazy in love I dont understand when both Brynner and Kerr  they both have very good chemistry stars in a movie together and then Brynner always die at the end it kind of reminds you The King and I in a way
1,This Fox spectacle was a big hit when released in 1954 Sumptiously produced with great music and sets intriguing cast it moves slowly but interestingly Edmund Purdom is strikingly handsome as an Egyptian who becomes a renowned doctor juggling three stunning women a handmaiden Jean Simmons who passively adores him temptress Bella Darvi who eludes him and a pharoahs sister Gene Tieney who wants him as HER pharoah The movies popularity has not waned since being reshown on AMC preferably in widescreen Purdom is particulary great his character apparently striking out with the women and ending up never married and a thinker Darvi is amazing and tantalizing in her femme fatale role Victor Mature Michael Wilding Peter Ustinov costar Check it out
1,During my teens or should I say prime time I was eating up all kinds of SF novels every day of the week It was in the Sixties and Seventies when TV was not such a important leisure time killer like today one night in the mid seventies I watched the movie on TV I think it was ARD and I was stunned I was impressed in a way that I can almost remember each scene even today Nowadays I observe my kids playing the SIMS or something like that and I think we are close to what that Fassbender Movie expressed I also would highly appreciate if I could buy this movie on a DVD But in vain I tried almost everything to get a hint where The movie MATRIX cannot touch by far the quality and the state of art of this movie And by the way by now we do not have a glue if we were a superior reality or just one of a couple simulation models Probably after our death we definitely will know
1,I have to say that some of the other reviews of this film I have read show very little understanding of it or the original TV series it stemmed from Dads Army was a sitcom and therefore had humour and so is bound to have put a smile on the face of the dire situation However the series carried very many serious messages such as the episode Branded about the bigotry and ignorance that was attached to conscientious objectors The film was faithful to the series and was simply like an extended episode So Im afraid the reviewer who claimed that Columbia improved the humour was quite wrong and lets face it  the BBC sitcoms of this period beat anything that came out of America hands down Also comments referring to propaganda were also way off the mark The Homeguard were people considered unfit for frontline service who still wished to serve They were very brave men who knew they were sentenced to death as soon as they signed up as Hitler announced that anyone who did so would be executed if and when Britain was invaded Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to set the record straight as it is always good to actually speak and comment on what has been seen rather making it up as you go along I find
1,i watched all of the doctor who episodes that my local PBS station played while growing upgot introduced to the doctor by way of John Pertweeas well as camera copies of doctor who sent to America by UK fans to their US counterparts i had a great time w the show but it never seemed to take itself seriously  i mean as seriously as a scifi show about a time traveler could be i went to the CONs did the costume bit doctor56 and Tegan were my costume characters loved it then it all came to a sudden halt program politics and lack of interest and funding turned doctor who into a 25year old antique that drifted into the ethos when i heard that the scifi channel had picked up the new doctor my first thought was cool now my 11 year old son can see what ive been babbling on about all these years and know what the heck a TARDIS is i have several phone boxes and TARDISes of various sizes around the housei didnt expect the excellent quality of story character development and fx i was to say the least  pleased for the first time i found a doctor that wasnt a curmudgeon a clown a fop a triphead a pussy or a jerk Christopher Eccleston is by far the most believable doctor to datenow now calm down tom baker fans dont get me wrong i loved almost every doctor and his quirks but Christopher gave something to the doctor that hed never had before  real word believability im just sad that he decided against another season ill try out David Tennant as i would any other doctor but now the bar has risen bad wolf rules 2008 update  i love David tennant his mod persona is something that my generation remembers my sons generation can deal with and fashion gestapo can relax hes a little more human than christopher but not as humas as other former doctors i miss rose i dig martha and what were they thinking with donna noble its still the best ride on TV
1, The Best Bit  When the dull mobster Nicholas Turturro calls out to the runaway Matthew Modine Shane  Come Back Shane  and when the older wise guy asks him What Are You Doing  he replays simply Enjoying My Time  Actually like me at the moment    The Most Creepy Part  Ive been wondering all the time of watching  where did I see that girl before  where  where  Till I found out while the closing credits OHH MY GOD  Shes Elizabeth Berkley  From the showgirls fiasco  But I just couldnt recognize her with her clothes on  To tell you the truth I felt a brief tremor Shes really cute and nice but maybe Hollywood had no mercy at all    The Most Sexy Bit  When Berkley says Do You Mean The Stuff Which Gives You A Boner    The Most Dull Thing  The retarded assistant after a day and a night in the back of the car is still alive and healthy at the end  moreover the Mexican smuggler took 3 bullets at the same car  and hes not dead either    The Most Ugly Thing  All of those murdered people as well as the numerous F ward to a boring extent    The Most Beautiful Thing  The crazy clever script with all the funny characters and the tumultuous situations the acting looked sweet also especially from Paul Rodriguez who stole the show for as he had the best dialogue Also    The Most Disappointing Thing  Although the direction didnt mess about the storys wittiness at all but in the same time it didnt give it a unique touch a matchless signature some kind of insane hilarity like the one in the story itself However maybe the low production wronged it well  And of course the easy tasteless music which could be like that because of cheap production too    The Most Confusing Part  Matthew Modine is a talented guy but what did he do exactly to be out of Hollywoods A list of stars  What could possibly be the thing he made or didnt make  to end up in light independent jest like The Shipment    The Most Absent Scene  Where did Jose the Mexican smuggler go at last  I thought that well see him again at the end smuggling once more as the surviving little criminal who in a brief gimmick like this could materialize the continuous disorder of such a world   The Most Question I had After The End  When well see The Shipment  2  As Im so eager to see that fine small comic hurlyburly atmosphere again   These were my own answers If you interested in giving answers of your own for this questionnaire please EMail me
1,Niagara Niagara is a stunning and heartbreaking story about the two outsiders Seth and Marcy Robin Tunney gives a fantastic performance as Marcy suffering from Tourettes Sydrome getting sicker and sicker as the movie progresses This movie is not very optimistic and its very hard emotional but at the same time very romantic Its hard to explain but see it and find out for yourself Its definitely worth it
1,This is one of the oddest movies I have watched in a long while Usually if they are this strange I bail out early and rarely regret it Luckily I held on for this one While I cant say that this is a great movie it isnt I can say that watching it is rather like a good acid trip  only a few really awful moments and the rest filled with did I really just see that wonderment Lots of laugh out loud moments A great cast of characters with Meredith Eaton outstanding as the dwarf daughterinlaw with an attitude Keep an open mind
1,Having finally been able to get the DVD of this 1997 HBO film is at down to watch it By the time I finished it the old saying those who can not learn from the past are doomed to relive it was echoing in the mind First shown four years after the first bombing of the twin towers and four years before the events of 911 Path To Paradise reveals the series of close encounters blunders and official indecisions that led to the first bombing of the twin towers and the lessons we should have learned from them Path To Paradise features a nice cast of believable actors Peter Gallagher and Marcia Gay Harden lead the cast as FBI agents John Anticev and Nancy Floyd who face not only the threats of terrorism but the lack of official interest from their superiors along with their NYPD counterpart Lou Napoli Paul Guilfoyle Art Malik Andreas Katsulas Shaun Toub and Tony Gillan are among those who plan and carry out the attack all of whom play their roles not as potential clichés but as real living people and make the film all the better for it Of special mention is Ned Eisenberg as Emad Salem the man whom if it had not been for skeptical FBI officials could have potentially informed on the plot The film is also well produced Despite being made for cable this film doesnt feel like a lowbudget film at all with its production values particularly in its sets and New York City locations The films fascinating cinematography gives the film an almost documentary style at times When all of these elements are combined with the script it all helps to give the film a sense of reality which makes the events taking place all the more disturbing The most disturbing thing about he film is its script The events of the film are true minus some dramatic license which is always necessary and in hindsight are made even more shocking then they must have been when the film was first shown twelve years ago The film reveals just how a group of men were able to smuggle a bomb into the World Trade Center They did so thanks to the lack of Arabic translators government agencies failing to pass information to each other the FBI ignoring leads from a source and police departments being unable to pick up on clues Worse then investigators inabilities to connect dots is the fact that many of these same things not only allowed the 911 attacks to take place but in some cases such as the lack of translators are issues that continue even today Even more chilling is the ending which really did happen and looks all too prophetic today Path To Paradise is a film that should be essential viewing today The film is not only well acted and produced but teaches us a lesson we should have learned sooner The lesson of the film That those who can not learn from the past are doomed to relive it If you can find this film then watch it and learn from it
1,Sui generis Folks Im not going to lie to you Merhige is a one or two hit wonder but what a film it almost excuses SUSPECT ZERO Im also not going to pretend to understand it completely half of what makes it what it is is trying to second guess what the hell they are doing on the screen because of the chiaroscuro Richard Corliss says It is as if a druidical cult had reenacted for real three Bible stories  creation the Nativity and Jesus torture and death on Golgotha Thats not a bad description but there seems to be more to it than the seemingly onetoone religious correspondences Theres an environmental theme right up near the surface  note that toward the end after the barrenness of the landscape there are large pipes not unlike those on a construction site Oh no hes going to say look at how people are raping mother nature One rarely sees a dead metaphor in action and with this much hyperbole but to see it acted out is way grislier than language implies And yeah if you just want something to sync with a death metal soundtrack it does have the requisite atrocities But as for myself and others like me its an important art film that should merit a Criterion collection release Ranks right up there with Murnaus FAUST  Ray
1,My Young Auntie is unique in a lot of ways First this is Hui YaHungs Kara Hui first action film Second She was actually doing the fight scenes after having a surgery done to her a few days before filming Third this movie is off the chain The movie starts out with Wang Lung Wei trying to take the inheritance from his brother His brother then has Kara to marry him so Wang cant take the treasure The story is pretty good leading everything to its rightful place In comes the action what can I say that hasnt already been said for movies like this or Disciples of the 36th Chambers The Victim or even the Magnificent Butcher The fight scenes are what sales movie and this one wont have any problem doing so Liu Chia Liang and Wang Lung Wei engaged in a fight that you have to see to believe Why have these two men not fought each other more is beyond me I dont want to spoil anything really but you have to see My Young Auntie to get the full blast of excitement My only gripe is that Yuen Tak was not used as broad as he was used in 3 Evil Masters or even Invincible Pole Fighter 8 Diagram Pole Fighter to excellent must see movies 9210
1,Its always interesting to catch a line in a film that winds up being somewhat prophetic for the future of an actor In this case I was intrigued by Edward G Robinsons statement to Barbara Stanwyck  I promised you the Valley as he discusses the lone hold outs to his attempt to control all the land in Logasa Ten years later Stanwyck would star as the matriarch of the Barkley Family on The Big Valley Somehow I thought she might have looked older in the earlier picture I guess all those bright gowns and fancy riding outfits have a way of bringing out ones youthful side As for my summary line above thats Lee Wilkisons appraisal of John Parrish Glenn Ford one of those hold outs mentioned earlier shortly after Parrish uses his knowledge of military tactics to take out a number of Wilkison hands after they raid his ranch and torch his home I liked the way the film explored his character starting with the way he dealt with foreman Wade Matlock Richard Jaeckel in a calculated showdown The set up for the ambush was also a clever maneuver diametrically opposed to the strategy of rushing the bad guys head on with both sides fighting it out to the last man standing For that Parrish also had something to say  Never meet the enemy on his terms The Violent Men is a good title for this film and was probably at the head of its class in the mid 1950s though by todays standards doesnt come close to the blood letting one will find in a Tombstone or Open Range where the bullets exact a nasty savagery But its shaped by fine performances from the principals with a sub plot exploring infidelity that seemed almost ironic considering it was Stanwycks character who was cheating
1,Every time this movie used to reair on late night TV in the late 70s and early 80s I would always make time to sit in front of the TV and watch it To see the lovely Kate Jackson handsome Richard Long the great Polly Bergen whom Ive never seen anywhere else except for this TV movie the endearing Tom Bosley and another great whom Ive never seen outside this movie Celeste Holme This is truly the love boat on a cruise to murder and mayhem and boy was it ever good And every time I would watch it I would always forget who the real murderer was As expected someone here is already criticizing the movie as if that really is a big help to anyone This is a great TV movie and worth watching each and every time I cant say that about half the movies Ive seen this month If you ever get a chance to watch it on TV someday which isnt likely watch it In light of The Girl Most Likely To finally coming out this year on DVD maybe theres hope for a DVD release of Death Cruise
1,There are so many 10 Best lists which could easily fit The Dead  Best Screen Drunk Best Literary Adaptation Best Use Of Music Not Specifically Written for the Film Best Use of Poetry Best Screen Speech Best Ensemble Cast and finally perhaps Best Film Ever Made This was John Hustons last and greatest film adapted by his son Tony from James Joyces short story and set on the evening of the Feast of the Epiphany in the Dublin of 1904 It is confined largely to one setting the home of the Morkan sisters and not a great deal happens in conventional dramatic terms They entertain their guests there is singing dancing recitations and much small talk but watching this film you cant imagine anywhere else you would rather be than in this company Finally of course it is about much much more It is about love loss and regret those stable mainstays of great drama In the films closing scenes the tenor Bartell DArcy Frank Patterson sings a song The Lass of Aughrim which conjures up in the mind of Gretta Anjelica Huston wife of Gabriel Donal McCann the ghost of her first and probably greatest love a boy who died in all certainty of a broken heart at the age of seventeen and suddenly Gabriel realises he has never really known his wife and that he has not been the great love of her life after all Emotionally these scenes are incredibly powerful firstly as Gretta recounts the circumstances of her lovers death and then as the voice in Gabriels head sums up his own feelings This is great cinema the monologues superbly delivered by Huston and McCann But then all the performances are extraordinary This is ensemble playing of the highest order and while it would be invidious to single out one performer above another has the screen ever given us a more likable genial or convincing drunk than Donal Donnelly or has poetry ever been delivered with such passion that Sean McClory the IRA man in The Quiet Man brings to his reading of Lady Gregorys translation of Donal Og here Added poignancy is to be had of course from the knowledge that Huston himself was close to death when he made this film which seems to me the culmination of his lifes work Death may well be its central theme but viewing this film is a lifeenhancing experience
1,The inspiration for this film was the fact that American Gangsters are well dresses but the Aussies well when you might kill a guy as soon as look at the blighter then you can dress as badly as you want and people wont criticize you Jimmy is fighter an illegal boxer sometimes bouncer and is offered work by Pando the local gangster boss in the cross That is Australias notorious Kings Cross District not the Cross of London fame as many a British backpacker finds out the hard way Due to feelings of love he stuffs up a job loses a lot of money and has to get it to Pando before Pando and his heavies can kill him Lots of dark humour interesting action revelations about the Australias underside and human nature It is very centred in the Australian nature and explores the nature of Australian criminals versus the American and British ones One problem is that each of the elements of the story dont have enough substance and depth but it is a painting with broad strokes that covers a lot of area not covered previously so as an overall package it is worthwhile Team it up with Chopper and Dirty Deeds for your Aussie Crime fest or Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Millers Crossing for an International falling short of the criminal gangs fest By the way Bryan Brown is a great actor who has just done a huge number of really bad movies Here is one of his great movies
1,I actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule And amazingly I found it really original I have commented on other Colombian films before and I agree that Colombian movies tend to have a similar scheme and always try to make reference to the average vulgar peopleespecially trying to make jokes out of the continuous cursing But lets face it the language used in this film is not especially exaggerated Unfortunately this is how real people speak The storyline and the pacing are brilliant and it could be extrapolated to any country in the world The acting was great and the script is to me one of the best ones ever produced in Colombian soil I think that anyone around the globe can get a good one hour and a half of entertainment with a beautifully well directed bluffing black humor comedy It kind of reminded me of films like snatch and others of the sort I highly recommend it and hope it can be viewed by more people since Colombian movies seem to have started to be more internationally focused since last year
1,A sleeper I had never even heard of this movie until I was channel jumping one night Ive been a police officer myself for 25 years and thought this was a true to life movie Nonpolice critics are rating the movie purely from a critics point of view and not from a police officers point of view This is real
1,That this film flopped at the box office and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today is a great pity  yet somehow rather appropriate The commercial suicide the Monkees committed by making this film is mirrored by the metaphorical suicide they commit onscreen To destroy so brutally their carefully constructed image as a wholesome American alternative to the Beatles is courageous to the point of rashness as is the admission of being no more than pawns in the entertainment industry trapped in the movie literally in their own artificiality The Monkees television series was not that conventional but HEAD is utterly plotlessalthough in the end there is actually some kind of circular logic to it all Unrestrained by a genuine storyline the surreal sequence of events is by turns hilarious and rather disturbing The greatest irony is that the Monkees effectively signed their death warrant as a commercial force at a time when they were reaching their artistic peak Their exploration into psychedelia reached its zenith with the soundtrack to HEAD all the songs are memorably woven into the film which is one of the landmarks albums of the sixties The Monkees began to disintegrate after the box office failure of this movie but HEAD serves as a noble legacy
1,This is my all time favorite Looney Tunes cartoon Its a common plot Daffy Duck tries to convince Elmer Fudd that it is really rabbit season and shoot Bugs But your can never outsmart that rabbit In addition to usual cartoon comedy this cartoon is supported by great word play that will keep you rolling on the floor
1,I dont usually comment on films since I am in the movie distribution business but I have to say that this is one of my favorite films of all time The acting is fantastic and the script is even better There were no cheesy speeches or exploitation of handicapped people to try and make this movie more Hollywood James McAvoy is such an outstanding actor I could not look away from him if I tried I was impressed with Steven Robertson as well I cannot believe this is his first real film Brenda Fricker plays a small role but as usual she is outstanding This is a movie for everyone to see just how lucky we all are If you like Awakenings and Mask you will enjoy this story You owe it to yourself to check this film out
1,Nurse Betty is really an interesting movie I guess we all know someone who is so convinced that the characters in a soap opera are real that you cant explain them with any means that these are just actors and not real persons Nurse Betty isnt a nurse at all In real life she is an ordinary housewife who works at a diner To escape from her awful husband and the problems in her miserable life she has become a very dedicated fan of a soap opera After she witnessed her husband being murdered she goes into some kind of a shock and she loses all grip on reality She thinks shes in love with one of the characters from the soap opera a doctor and decides that shell visit him and start a family with him The hit men however think that she knows too much and go after her to kill her As I already said the subject is quite recognizable if you leave the professional hit men and the murder out of it and the movie was funny The story was well directed and the actors did a fine job It had everything I always want to see when watching a comedy I give it a 7510
1,I think that this movie is actually entertaining although it lacks some features essential for this kinda films First of all when Doug and Chappy start their mission they take off with F16B and during the combat scenes they are piloting F16A The second thing I dislike of this film is the everrepeating F16 rolling to its right to escape from missileswhy chaff and flares havent been shown in any movie yet Third of all once you see the F16 almost empty of ammo it appears again plenty of missiles the models used to simulate the destroyed aircraft aint good either However I think that using IAI Kfir as opponent planes was really good far better than the F5 shown in Top Gun but this movie isnt as good as that masterpiece A funny movie I love planes and Ive seen it more than 3 times
1,IN THE LINE OF FIRE in my opinion is an excellent suspenseful and edgeofyourseat actiondramathriller I thought that Agent Horrigan Clint Eastwood and Agent Raines Rene Russo looked good in the attire they wore at the presidential dinner As for Leary John Malkovich he was a sick man who loved to toy with Frank by phone He looked good in the tuxedo he wore near the end of the film though One thing that surprised me was the growing attraction between Agent Horrigan and Agent Raines Before I wrap this up Id like to say that the entire cast and crew did an outstanding job I loved the setting and I couldnt get enough of it Now in conclusion to all you Clint Eastwood fans who havent seen this excellent suspenseful and edgeofyourseat actiondramathriller I highly recommend it
1,Theres a good running bit about the price tag of a silk negligee The bimbo in the office shows off the bargain she got for 22 closeup of tag Later Mary Astor finds the tag in the bosss bedroom proof that bimbo slept with him Still later Mary Astor is about to have an affair with Ricardo Cortez looks at the price tag of HER silk negligee 14 and is reminded of how disgusted she was about the bimbo as well as the fact that shes spent 8 less than the most obvious woman shes ever met It sounds an obvious morality turn but it was well done The film would be stronger if Robert Ames character had been played by a more powerful actor hes too lowkey for a selfmade salesman and he spends most of the film with his face turned away from the camera and if Ricardo Cortez had been given more to do than smile ironically Both male leads are bland and forgettable and are hindered by the pancake male makeup so popular in this films era However the Mary Astor character is interesting appealing and believable Behind Closed Doors is well worth seeing
1,After a long run in the West End this charming film recast Margaret Rutherford as the Headmistress Miss Whitchurch in this financially successful adaptation made in 1950 All interior shots took place at Riverside studios in Hammersmith London The exterior scenes were filmed on location at a public girls school near Liss in Hampshire During the 12  week shoot both Margaret Rutherford and Joyce Grenfell were staying in a hotel nearby and would often visit the school during the evenings where they would happily enjoy the company of the real school mistresses Although the films script contains only two original lines from the original play the leads and supporting actors are in fine form and you can only feel sympathetic for their predicament especially in the final scenes
1,Claudine was one of the very first movies that gave positive role models for both Black men and women I appreciated this movie even more as I got older This movie shows that men didnt always turn away from responsibility An excellent movie Id always recommend for anyone who appreciates a good inner city love story
1,this movie may not have seemed like much to some people but it had everything i look for in a comedy fall down funny moments accompanied by a moment or two of seriously moving scenes great actors and pretty much everything a good movie is supposed to be like despite David spade playing his usual snobby character he made this role into an unusual performance which i dont think he had ever exceeded until he hit the screen with Joe dirt regardless of whether or not some people were not Chris Farley fans i saw this film when it came out and my friends and i still talk about it 11 years later this movie was what finally told me that Chris Farley was the real deal he is the best comedian i have seen in my life in the words of some he could be clumsy clever funny serious crazy sober and moving or depressing at the same time not the same words but the message is all that counts one of the true great actors of our time and one of the true great comedys of all time along with good acting good story hilarious moments serious scenes that at times brought me to tears this movie stands atop the hordes as a movie that marked the beginning of a brief reign at the top of the comedy world by the late great Chris Farley no actor before or since has captured my interests in a movie since because no actor before or since has put so much into his movies this movie is worth the time if you havent taken the time to see it do so the next time you rent a movie
1,The French Babbette appears at the modest house of two Danish sisters wet cold and alone Fleeing revolution in Paris she seeks refuge in an obscure religious community on the windswept Jutland coast Unbeknownst to those who so generously take her in she is a great chef an artist of food Babette gives herself to her adopted community through thrift productivity and shared faith She leaves only when she wins the French lottery10000 francs She returns laden with exotic cargo the makings of a single meal commemorating the birthday of the sisters father the communitys founder This meal looms darkly in the minds of the pleasuredenying faithful but its subtleties are translated by an aging military officer who as a young man in Paris learned to appreciate the sensory experience unfolding here The meal is the films climax a communion of love in the transitory artistry of foodunaffectedly uplifting about art love and the meaning of life
1,A movie visually graceful but interesting is mainly the plot The film depicts a zigzag progress of exploring the main actors innermost feeling Max who has lived in New York for two years and intend to marry a girl he met there comes back to Paris and unexpectedly meets his exgirlfriend whom he still fancies very much but finally finds out the one he loves the most in fact is her best friend Nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well The three women Max has met symbolize something we must pursue although possibly having no clear picture about the underlying motivations His fiancee is the one he needs rather than the one he loves and thus completely no loyalty we can see She gives him also no love but only stability True love also cannot be found in his relation with the exgirlfriend Merely a fantasy for him to escape  many things very romantic he has done for her but almost nothing seems amenable The one who really animates Maxs life in fact is her best friend The equilibrium achieved at the end is not identical to the initial equilibrium because Max has understand much more about his innermost feeling The nonlinear structure makes the progress of searching look more complicated Not equally ingenious as Pulp Fiction but things seem much more natural in The Apartment Max is not the only character who undergoes a transformation and in fact interesting is also the description to Romane Bohringer The good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful A good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing  
1,Just watched Conrack for the first time Although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired it is a very touching and heartwarming study of a mans evolution to overcome his youth and upbringing in a prejudiced south and a teachers creativity in connecting with students despite different backgrounds and difficult circumstances As an educator seeing a teacher adapt to his students and prepare them for all of the challenges life has to offer not just the lessons found in textbooks is a valuable concept of which we all need to be reminded The thread concerning the Vietnam war rings true even today Well worth a look
1,This movie has an outstanding acting by Marilia Pêra and a stunning dicretcion by the argentine Hector Babenco This is in my opinion the best Brazilian movie ever made The movie was filmed with child from the favelas  the brazilian ghetos The children werent actors and were casted by Babenco in the city of Rio de Janeiro The story is about the criminal children that are arrested in the correctional prison that looks much worse than Alcatraz The children are constantly raped and beaten by the policeman Unfortunately this is not purely fiction in Brazil it does happen till today A must see for those who like violent movies But take your mother off the room because it is a hard movie
1,A film about the relationship between a man and leopard thats very reminiscent of The English Patient even down to a scene similar to when Ralph Fiennes character carries the body of his lover across a desertrock cliff In A Passion in the Desert the main character carries the body of the leopard across a desertrock cliff but in the opposite direction calculated decision or unconscious contrast Historically expanded from a very short Balzac story the film is not perfect but a treat no less Final shot will haunt me for weeks 8 of 10
1,I saw Bon voyage 2 days ago and I found it an excellent production The film is supposed to entertain and it does It emulates the style of the American screwball comedies of the 30s but Von voyage is more refined Adjani and Depardieu are simply excellent in their roles The plot is simple The film starts with people involved in many situations that apparently should have nothing to do between them It is very funny how those situations become linked during the film It is good to see a French film with this kind of sense of humor I find it principally a film in which love is the main theme Peter Coyote as the German spy in France shows once more to be an excellent actor too
1,For Greta Garbos first talking picture MGM wisely chose Eugene ONeills Pultizer Prize winning 1921 play ANNA Christie  Also wisely the producers backed Garbo up with not one but two members of the Original Broadway Cast George Marion as Annas father Chris and James T Mack as Johnny the Priest  transmuted to Johnny the Harp for films so as not to offend  This little change is interesting Like too many films accused by those who want MOVIES to be MOVIES and ignore their origins of being little more than filmed stage plays the problem is not the play but the movie makers who wouldnt be more faithful to the property By diluting a great cinematic stage work so it wouldnt offend anyone or opening it up because they COULD too many lose the very qualities which made the piece worth filming in the first place  Fortunately the respect the studio had for both ONeill and Garbo allowed ANNA Christie to survive the normally destructive process admirably in Frances Marions generally sensitive screen adaptation Wonder of wonders Marion even allows the POINT of the scene where Garbos Anna reveals her past on the farm to the man she badly wants to marry and the father who sent her there in tact What the League of Decency must have thought of that  The source plays greatest problem has always been that Chriss friend Marthy tends to walk away with the first act and then disappears from the last two so that Anna can take stage  the two sides of the genuinely good woman men dont always recognize  The perfectly cast Marie Dressler who had cut her teeth on the Broadway stage as well before going to Hollywood is the perfect balance for Garbos Anna in this area as well and the fast moving film at only 90 minutes doesnt allow us too much time to miss her  one of the few benefits from atmosphere being shown rather than eloquently described in the original  AND screenwriter Marion is wise enough to stray from ONeill to bring Dressler back for a touching scene two thirds of the way through the film that will remind many of Julie Lavernes second act appearance in SHOW BOAT  Anna and Marthys early scene together on screen 16 minutes into the film taking each others measure and setting up all the tension of the rest of the story is among the most affecting scenes in the entire piece Not to be missed  ANNA Christie is great tragic play and a good film drama Its hard to imagine that a latter day remake which would almost certainly lose the grit and atmosphere of this 1930 remake it was first filmed without sound in 1923  also with George Marions original Broadway Chris could improve on this excellent filming  The internal scenes hew closest to the play but the exteriors shouldnt be missed by anyone with an eye to atmosphere While the background screen work is not to modern technical standards the backgrounds give a better glimpse than most films of the era of the actual world in which the screen play is set especially in the New York harbor Nearly all Garbos naturalistic performances of the sound era have held up superbly only the too often parodied death scene from CAMILLE 7 years later will occasionally draw snickers because of the heavy handed direction and the parodies but this ANNA Christie together with the variety of her 1932 films MATA HARI and GRAND HOTEL and the sublime Lubitsch touch on her 1939 comedy NINOTCHKA Garbo laughs surely stand as her best ONeill fans who are taken with this play at the edge of his lauded sea plays should track down the fine World War II shaped film released in the year before the US entered the conflict THE LONG VOYAGE HOME 1940 It is almost as skillfully drawn from those sea plays as this one is from ANNA Christie and features a youngish John Wayne in one of his rare nonWesterns supporting a fine cast of veteran actors showing him the way
1,I think Samuel Goldwyn was trying to accomplish two things in this film First the film is a homage to Jascha Heifetz considered to be the best violin virtuoso of the past century Secondly having brought to the screen the Dead End kids with his film of the same title and seeing them sign with Warner Brothers he was trying to create a second gang of appealing urchins  Though the film was good there certainly was no demand that the kids from this film be reteamed for another feature  Leader of the gang is Gene Reynolds who at one time played the violin but now leads a street gang of disreputable urchins His stepfather Arthur Hohl breaks the violin his late father gave young Reynolds and threatens to send him to reform school over the feeble protests of his mother Marjorie Main Young Reynolds happens to stumble onto a music school run by the old music maestro himself Walter Brennan and his daughter Andrea Leeds They take him in but they have their financial problems with a lot of creditors led by Porter Hall This film is mostly to be seen today because its a chance for classical music lovers to see and hear Jascha Heifetz who as you gather is the solution one way or another to everybodys problems Joel McCrea is in this film also but has a rather colorless part as Andrea Leeds boyfriend  Besides Heifetz one thing the film does do is touch on albeit gingerly on the topic of child abuse and battered spouses Arthur Hohl is one mean man and Marjorie Main is very clearly a much battered wife The kids in the cast do well Reynolds Tommy Kelly Terry Kilburn and a young girl under the name of Jacqueline Nash who grew up and performed as Gale Sherwood nightclub partner to Nelson Eddy She had a nice soprano even as a child But its Heifetz you see the show for
1,Thank goodness for the Coen Brothers Their success has brought them bigger budgetsbut hasnt rid them of their creativity I had planned on seeing another movie but it was sold out so I went to this one instead By the time it began I had forgotten what movie I was there to see I was surprised in more ways than one This movie is hilarious but they dont make any cheap jokes just to get the laughs The writing is brilliant and delivered with great skill by George Clooney after this nobody can say hes just a pretty face and the rest of the cast It can be appreciated on many levels whether you remember the Odyssey or not I cant remember the last time I saw a movie that was this clever Ive seen others I would describe as beautiful intriguing funny and charming all of which also describe Oh Brother but this movie reminded me of older seinfeld episodes where all the subplots came together in the end You can feel that their journey is building up to something but you cant tell what And the Coen brothers do not fail us the end is certainly not disappointing Its surprising and ties up all the loose ends neatly without wearing the story out
1,I thought this was a very good TV series and I would like to see it continue It really got interesting there at the end and I really want to see where it is going from there Some times we are to quick to kill a series without giving it a chance I think this one needs a chance to go on and I will definitely be waiting for it The ocean is one of the places that man knows so little about and I think that is a mystery in itself What is waiting for us beneath the waters of the world It is even said that man maybe crawled out or slivered out of the waters many millennium ago Is this a new evolution coming about Are we going to move down the food chain or fight for our position
1,It was good to see John Denver again though he passed several years ago I found this film to be very heartwarming and a great film to sit by the fire on a cold winters night recollecting what Christmas is all about The scenes of Georgetown Colorado were magnificent and make one want to move there immediately As I sit here in my own mountain seen in So California I loved the story and the plot I hope all who see this somewhat older film enjoy it as much as my mother and I did Merry Christmas A great film for all the family too see Enoy and tell others about it Thanks for the memories We need to have more films like this come out of Hollywood
1,This amusing sometimes poignant look at the Hollywood detective genre of the 1940s and 1950s stars Robert Sacci as an unnamed former cop who retires uses his life savings to pay for plastic surgery to transform his image into that of his idol Humphrey Bogart then sets up shop as a private eye under the name Sam Marlowe Robert Sacchi incidentally is one of the rare few Bogart impersonators who got the lisp exactly right more to the point the body and facial language are there For awhile Sams only client is his landlady who wants him to find her undersized boyfriend and his only conversational foil is his secretary simply called Dutchess Misty Rowe who in his own words looked like Marilyn Monroe and made about as much sense as Gracie Allen and has a passion for banana splits Then he encounters Elsa Olivia Hussey the plain sweet virginal daughter of a retired propsmaster who has been murdered for no discernible reason In the process of investigating the murder Sam shortly runs across the Gene Tierney lookalike daughter Michelle Phillips of Anastas an avaricious obscenely wealthy Greek shipping tycoon Victor Buono turning in a creditable Sidney Greenstreet his hapless longsuffering second wife Yvonne deCarlo who manages to play a variety of putupon emotions without saying a word his two smarmy henchmen Herbert Lom channelling Peter Lorre and Jay Robinson doing a reasonably accurate Lionel Atwill and Anastas vicious amoral MiddleEastern potentate Franco Nero who comes complete with a glamorus and bafflingly loyal mistress Sybil Danning all of whom would give anything to acquire the Eyes of Alexander two huge perfectly matched star sapphires When Elsa is murdered Marlowes interest in solving the case becomes personal and he sets out through a labyrinth of Los Angeles landmarks including the Hollywood Bowl the scatological and esoteric attractions of Hollywood Boulevard and Santa Catalina Island in pursuit of the rocks determined to get at them before either of the two wealthy competitors Throw in cameos by Mike Mazurki and assorted others the traditional dumbbutsympathetic ally on the police force and a plethora of nicely drawn character turns that provide dimension to practically all players and despite an unfortunate title song you have to my mind a thoroughly enjoyable movie experience
1,This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book brilliantly animated by UPAs finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon Later episodes in the series of which there were four in total were not actually based on original Dr Seuss material although all but the last continued to use his familiar rhyming style The three sequels were Gerald McBoing Boings Symphony 1953 How Now Boing Boing 1954 Gerald McBoing Boing On Planet Moo 1956  although he also appeared in a later episode of Mr Magoo
1,In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD Im expecting to see the My Mother the Car collection any day now this film has been unfairly neglected There are innumerable stupid comedies from the 60s as well as many other eras that have received at least a cursory DVD treatment This one wasnt even released on VHS to my knowledge despite the talents involved in the making Arthur Hiller Eli Wallach Anne Jackson Murray Shisgal notable later for cowriting Tootsie even Dustin Hoffman in his debut Its obviously a product of the sixties but so is just about everything else from that era All films reflect the tastes and customs of the times in which they are made This was released the same year as The Presidents Analyst another absurd masterpiece That film was finally released on DVD and has developed a cult following This film has many memorable bizarre goofy wacky moments Sure its painted in broad strokes and has silly gogo music throughout but thats part of its charm It creates its own absurd universe If whoever is in charge of DVD production for Columbia Pictures releases I believe Columbia released it takes polls for new releases this gets my vote
1,I saw this at the 2004 Stony Brook Film Festival in NY and it was very warmly received In this preWW2 film a pair of German rocket scientists are working on the Scottish Isle of Scarp as war looms on the horizon The characters encountered on the island are priceless in their creation and their portrayal Shauna MacDonald is particularly memorable After getting up to speed on the Scootish accents the viewer feel right at home with these folk who watch with amusement as the Germans work to link their isle with the mainland via a rocketbased mail delivery As implausible as it seems this film was based on an actual story All in all a memorable film that will stay with you for some time thanks to its casting its story or its scenery
1,Much more than ANY other film from that period Night of the Demons represents the brainless and hugely enjoyable horror pastiche Its undemanding fun with loads of nasty makeup effects gorgeous looking and horny teenagers and adorable clichéelements A group of party animals led by the alternative Angela goes to celebrate Halloween in an abandoned funeral home that carries an eerie urban legend It all starts out typical and innocent with dancing drinking and the occasional flirt between youngsters that cant keep their hormones under control but pretty soon a bloodthirsty demon possesses the hostess In the most ingenious ways youve ever seen the rest of the cast gets slaughtered viciously only to return as hideous creatures prowling for blood The thing that makes this film better than most cheesy 80s horror films is finds a good balance between lightheaded camp and atmospheric horror Some sequences really are creepy and the funeral house setting supplies Night of the Demons with an excellent tone Director Tenney makes great use of the set pieces coffins a crematorium endless dark hallways and his young enthusiast cast obviously love what theyre involved in The terrific makeup effects by a whole team of artists and designers are of course the obvious aspects to love and horror fanatics will absolutely love the large amount of severed limbs poked out eyes and crushed skulls The ultimate highlight however is Linnea Quigleys trick with the disappearing lipstick This nymphomaniac bimbo shoves an entire tube of lipstick in her nipple and continues her sexual murder spree Terrific Night of the Demons received two sequels during the 90s and although theyre still definitely worth checking out they focus more on comedy than chills
1,An absolute classic of 80s scare flix This one isnt like any other as it pits pintsize wildeyed psychotic youngsters with an urge to kill against all the grownups in town Bud from JUST ONE OF THE GUYS 80s gold again plays one of the killerkids and hes paired up with one of the little girls Jake Blues tries to purchase in the BLUES BROTHERS There is a third blond boy but he keeps disappearing from the movie for whatever reason The violence is hilarious at times and also surprisingly gruesome in spots The demonic gang of smiling kids though somehow possessed by extraplanetary means bear little resemblance to the droidish Children of the Damned who never thought to use pistols crossbows and shovels to kill those pesky adults Julie Brown not Downtown Julie Brownthe other one shows her rack like three times as she dances around in her bedroom This movie is a rarity that I cannot believe I missed growing up in the 80s This would have been my absolute favorite movie as a kid if I had seen it Where is the sequel the ending begs for This movie is just incredible Seek it out at all costs
1,In these modern times as subject known quite well to the director of the short film that this German count is going to talk about politically correct films are the leitmotiv of the modern young filmmakers projects Shoulder Arms directed by Herr Charlie Chaplin during WWI the film was released only a few weeks before the armistice is an obvious example of why the early cinema pioneers were a very bold people certainly To direct a humorous film inspired in the terrible bloody First World War was a complicated matter that only few directors with those dangerous and daring ideas could be allowed to do to venture upon such delicate enterprise and with success was reserved only to geniuses As this German count said Shoulder Arms was made during WWI that time in where definitely the whole world lost its innocence fortunately not the German fat heiresses of this aristocrat and it is a hilarious inventive social satire about that and any war The film it is full of great gags and entertaining film continuity for a story in where that tramp will live though risky and courageous adventures in the front whether a hero for the allies or not To mock the war trenches the unhealthiness the frontal attacks and the Germans how you dare by the way there are a lot of inaccuracies in the film  the German soldiers by that time had moustaches and longer beards not to mention that the Kaiser lacks many medals in his uniform in an elegant funny and delicate way it is even today a film miracle impossible of being surpassed Keeping in mind those terrible wartime circumstances the difficult task is only possible thanks to a lot of creativity and talent Obviously Herr Charlie Chaplin had very much of it And now if youll allow me I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must go back to the Schloss trenches Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien httpferdinandvongalitzienblogspotcom
1,After Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be just as dangerous as men there was obviously an open market for other movies to pick up and carry the torch and what more a lovely actress than Dorothy Provine from Its A Mad Mad Mad Mad World to play the role The downsize is that cute and blonde Provine may just be too sweet and innocent looking to step into Allison Hayes size 50 shoes This role really needed someone with an amount of smoldering sex appeal Provine is more the girl next door type She may have taken and done this role to prove she could be sexy but the material lets her down Lou Costello however proves he can do a movie without Bud Abbott feeding him lines and he even interjects a dramatic role in some of his scenes when he not turning to Gale Gordon as his front man for gags Gordon however establishes that all he can be is blustery perturbed and pushy much the same character he creates later on The Lucy Show Charles Lane also plays the same role in everything he does a straight man and his screen time is limited The special effects are convincing for the time but I would have liked Dorothy to have been a little more than cheesecake and dressing and at least have been allowed to become dangerous As the movies lead character she takes second billing to Costello who is in all of the movie with Dorothy several times vanishing like a subplot The whole movie put together just cant decide if its supposed to be science fiction a comedy or just a parody of the Allison Hayes classic Theres a lot of good scenes some very funny humor and some very ridiculous camp that affects the rest of the film Still I do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one If this movie had a chance to be remade today Id highly recommend Courtney Cox and Jason Alexander in the lead roles and allow me to completely rewrite the original script Courtney tops my lists of actresses who I believe could and should adequately play gorgeous giantesses although I have to admit that if either of the titanic beauties Allison or Dorothy came after me Id go quietly 
1,One of the best of the kitchensinks Fantastic views of London and invaluable snippets of working class life of the 60s Loachs eye seems to capture everything yet makes no judgment  a taste of things to come As with Kes Riffraff and Sweet Sixteen it serves as a cinematic social history of Britain Carol White is completely convincing you love her fancy her want to take care of her but hold your head at her selfdestructive decisions and still follow her in some vain hope Well backed up by Terence Stamp  fresh off The collector also catch The Hit  and a plethora of English faces  all looking very young  Pefectly set to Donovans dulcet tones Stamp sings Yellow is the color in a lovely scene ending with him saying  Getting better aint I   song also used in The rules of Attraction  I think  Watch Carol Whites screen mum getting ready to go out and get a bloke putting on her false eyelashes to the sound of Rosie on the radio  priceless A treasure for anyone who was around at the time and a reminder of how good life is now in England Incidentally Soderburgh used clips from Poor cow in The Limey
1, As a Harold Lloyd fan i agree with the other reviewers comments EXCEPT that I feel that Movie Crazy was his best sound film Cats Paw is a close second But this is just MY opinion This film is a hoot from beginning to end and in many scenes George Barbier the crook that gets him elected mayor almost steals the show Especially at the end of the film One wishes that Una Merkels character would be a bit more sympathetic to Harold especially as the film progresses Only in the last few minutes of the film do we find out her true feelings for him And even then there is no romance  kissing etc This is a MustSee film
1,Inspired casting charming and witty throughout Much like the currency in the opening moments of the film the story floats along magically until you are emotionally invested in its outcome The city of Buffalo has never looked better Kudos to the Burton Sisters and the entire cast for a job well done
1,Okay so there were the odd hole in the plot you could drive a zeppelin through but how well was the emotional stuff handled It would have been so easy to descend into cheesiness but the writer pulled it off The image of the ex female cyberman making crying noises as sheit saw her reflection after regaining her emotions is one that will stay with me forever Thats twice now the monsters have shown a soft side and been presented fleetingly sympathetically the previous being the last Dalek from series one but by Jove its worked Add to that the other exfemale who had been upgraded on the eve of her wedding and Jackie Tyler recognising her husband after she had become cyber and you have a permanent throat lump Keep it up
1,i´ve seen this piece of perfection  during the fantasy filmfest in berlin and when i went out of the cinema i felt like being drugged down i´ve seen a lot of films but there are just a few that i´d call perfect like koyaanisqatsi or fight clubsubconscious cruelty is definitely one of them half of the people went out of the screening in berlin and i can understand them absolutely this is not a movie for normal people with dreams and illusions a person that is living in hisher dreams day by day not wanting to see all the horror in our life and on our planet will be very shocked by this film if someone reads this now who has seen sc and also thinks it´s great just contact meso far i haven´t met anyone who shares my opinionit´d be cool this film earns 10 points out of 10 finally i´m really sorry for my bad englishi´m not a studied person und das ist auch gut so g
1,Thank god for this movie Its a document of talent that three decades later seems even more unique and rare in retrospect The music is just extraordinary packed with so much talent in writing performance arrangement and production that its absolutely infectious The lyrics and vocal arrangements are incredible The performances by underappreciated talents like Nell Carter and Ren Woods uplift my spirit every time I hear them While the film may be different from the stage version I prefer the soundtrack to the cast album which I find truly grating and underdeveloped Here the arrangements are filled out and expanded into dynamic pieces that couldnt have been produced in a stage setting But the music isnt the only thing extraordinary about this movie The juxtaposition of almost hyperrealist dialog scenes reminds me of Altman films intercut with exuberant musical and dance numbers really works All the talent in this moviedirecting writing photography editing music choreography casting acting costuming art directionmerge perfectly into one of the best musical films Ive seen I think its amazing how much we know about the characters in Hair based on very little information or plot Theyre not drawn as caricatures but as realistic and very human people We see little glimpses of where they come from but the portrait is completed by vignettes that draw the characters to the surface through accomplished acting directing and editing Theres an undercurrent theme of the misogyny of Berger and Hud which colors their characters by exposing their reckless machohippie ideology The scene of Bergers home life reveals important details about his psychology and the brief glimpse of Claudes home tells us volumes about his background through the simple realistic and genuine interaction between Claude and presumably his father I love the fashion in this movie It defiantly mixes sixties ideas with VERY seventies looks one does have to overlook Treat Williams hair extensions Its a document of how chic much of the lateseventies was contrary to the conventional wisdom that the era was all about bad taste Claudes beige knitted tie was a hot trend of 1979 and the hair and clothing of the singers and dancers particularly those in white during the Central Park scene mixes up the decades in a way that suggests the timelessness of the musicals themes These elements merge with Twyla Tharpes extraordinary stateoftheart choreography in a way that enhances the artistry of both Hairisnt a film that rewards cynicism If you come to it with expectations then youre most likely going to be held captive by artists who arent bound by your rules For me it opened my eyes and ears and spirit to an insightful and passionate musical dialog about war friendship and family that transcends its time and is still meaningful and relevant to me to this day
1,Michael Kehoe has accomplished quite a feat especially considering it is only his second start as writer producer AND director Generally first timers lack vision and direction when helming a major production but Dominion proves Mr Kehoe is going places in Hollywood Set with beautiful scenery Dominion boasts experienced cast members especially Thomerson  James who communicate Kehoes vast vision with exceptional clarity Few films can mix the slasherhorror genre with a genuine actionadventure feel but Dominion accomplished this completely This film certainly qualifies as one of the topnotch films in both of these categories If you are looking for fastpaced action with more than a modicum of suspense look no further I look forward to Kehoes future projects with great enthusiasm Well done
1,Fantastic Russian WWII movie Like most Russian WWII movies The Ascent is incredibly harrowing Its also dense in its symbolism The story follows two partisans Sotnikov and Rybak Boris Plotnikov and Vladimir Gostyukhin who go on a mission to search for food On their trip they are spotted by German soldiers who wound Sotnikov Sotnikov in turn kills one of the Germans which leads to trouble for the two partisans and everyone else they later run into The greatest success of the film is its vivid sense of place Russia is frozen and snowy and its hard not to feel that cold go straight to your own bones Shepitko keeps her shot close to the characters examining every crag of their faces It was probably not the choice but the film is framed 1331 which gives the film a sense of claustrophobia While the entire film is quite an achievement I did feel that the first half was stronger than the second My main complaint about the movie is that it develops into a very unsubtle Christian allegory by its climax I just dont think the symbolism adds much to the proceedings especially when I was already intrigued by the debate between the two partisans Its not quite fair I was weighing the pros and cons of their argument I began to lean toward the point of view of a certain character and then the director pops up and tells me that hes Judas Despite some heavyhandedness this is still a mustsee
1,This second fulllength Lone Ranger feature doesnt measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with enough rough and tumble action and moves along at a good clip The Ranger looks into a series of mysterious murders which have a sinister pattern to them with peaceful Indians being the victims of a gang of hooded killers There are more killings and violence usually associated with Lone Ranger adventures and the film has an undercurrent of racial insensitivity the comments of which are sprinkled throughout the screenplay The Ranger uses disguises as only he can to piece together clues and expose the outlaw band and bring them to justice Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels star in a colorful presentation that shows the desert and cactus country of old Tucson to good advantage The music score is good but the familiar William Tell Overture theme is nudged aside by vocals that are interesting but lack the flourish and beauty of the Rangers traditional theme
1,Ive seen various Hamlets and Ive taught the play As I watch Jacobi Im tempted to think that hes every bit as intelligent as Hamlet himself so alive is he to every nuance of this characters wit He deepens rather than solves every puzzle regarding Hamlets character He illuminates line after line word after word shining light into this sparkling mind At the same time however we cringe at the horror Hamlet feels at his betrayalfar more than with any other actorbecause Jacobi feels the pain more profoundly than anyone else And we shudder at Hamlets own betrayals because Jacobi is not afraid of the baseness to which Hamlet can descend In short Jacobi gives us Hamlet in full and Hamlet in full is the greatest character in literature Thats why Im satisfied that Jacobis Hamlet is the finest performance Ive seen by an actor
1,Chucky the murderous doll from Childs Play and 2 crappy sequels is dead But his exgirlfriend Tiffany Jennifer Tilly gets his remains and using Voodoo for Dummies revives him Then through circumstances too convoluted to get into SHE is killed and has her soul put into another doll Together they fall in love and kidnap a nice couple Nick Stabile Katherine Heigl to take them to Chucks coffin to get an amulet to make Chucky and Tiffany real people again A lot better than it sounds After the last two sequels to Childs Play both of which were horrible I was expecting the worst but this actually was lots of fun The movie doesnt take itself seriously for a second seriouslyhow could it and the lines and situations are actually quite funny Also there are a few VERY gory murders thrown in to satisfy us horror fans and the film never stops moving The movie also has a few things usually not found in a horror moviea gay best friend Gordon Michael Woolvett who is intelligent and not played for laughs and a sequence in which Stabile has his shirt off just to show his muscular body John Ritter has a nice cameo too as a sheriff The acting is goodStabile is young VERY handsome and likable Heigl doesnt have much to do but pulls it off and Brad Dourif the voice of Chucky and Tilly are hilarious as the murderous dolls My favorite part is when the dolls have sex dont ask and she asks for a rubber and he responds But Im MADE of rubber The special effects are good no lousy CGI here and this is one of the few horror films to mix humor and violence in an entertaining way Well worth seeing I give it a 9
1,Heres a wellmade war story nicely shot and wellacted The portraying of the Italian and German occupancy of Greek island Kefalonia is welldone John Hurt as Pelagias father and the island doctor is superb Nicolas Cage does a good job as the Captain from the title Penelope Cruz does a good job of being beautiful and batting her eyelashes at Cage Theres heroics and humor theres drama and romance and it is all set on an idyllic island Oddly enough a very similar or should I say almost identical storyline with the same characters going through the same series of events is told in a novel by the same title written by Louis de Bernieres This wonderful historical novel tells the story of beautiful Pelagia daughter of doctor Iannis and their life on Kefalonia during WWII Pelagias fiancee local fisherman Mandras enlists when the Italian Army invades northern Greece from Albania under false pretenses When the Axis finally prevails with a lot of help from the Germans a garrison of Italian soldiers is stationed on the island and Captain Corelli plays a big part in keeping the occupation a peaceful time As Mandras joins the partisans charming Corelli and his mandolin are quartered with the doctor and his beautiful daughter Of course this makes it a novel about love But it is also a war novel a summary of Greek history a tale of Communist uprising in postwar Greece a portrait of the madness of Mussolini and most importantly an ode to island life on Kefalonia Some of these elements return in the movie but in general it is an impossible book to film I am glad nobody ever tried The movie Captain Corellis Mandolin however is worth seeing Just make sure you read the book after you see the movie
1,Clint Eastwood scores big in this thriller from 1993Teamed with an absolute master of edge of your seat suspenseWolfgang Peterson Eastwood delivers as only he canAlsoJohn Malkovich goes on my list of most effective screen villains in the history of cinema as the demented assassinAs for Rene Russo as Clints love interestI think Kirk Douglas said it best when he saidreferring to his own careerI keep getting olderand my leading ladies keep getting youngerThis film is a very effective thriller with enough plot twists and surprises to keep you goingEastwood and Peterson should team together more often Top notch movie
1,After searching for 6 months I finally found this DVD All I can say is it was damn well worth the wait Rush in Rio may very well be the greatest rock DVD in existence Im not joking Its incredible All the fuss about the sound being crappy is true however it doesnt make the concert unwatchable I find it makes you feel like youre actually in Rio watching the concert from the audience Thats one of the reasons I love this DVD It makes you feel like youre actually there Also Geddy Alex and Neil have never been in better form Geddys vocals are flawless Alexs guitar playing is still incredible and Neil  absolutely no words to say The camera work on this concert was very good I must say They gave us a good look at everything that was going on onstage and in the audience Kudos to the cameramen Anyways enough of my raving Go watch Rush in Rio for yourself You will be amazed I guarantee it 1010
1,I was recommended this film as one of the best love stories ever told And as I am huge fan of love I bought the tickets and sat myself in the theatre After 90 minutes I left the theatre with nothing but disappointment and the theme song as the only positive thing of the film I was appalled at the story itself that two people can love each other but be so afraid as to never act it I just couldnt go passed the language barrier and the cultural barrier The second time I ran into it I was in a different mood no longer had any expectation  and had more patience more relaxed mind to see the film and as soon as I opened my eyes I discovered the love the beauty of the film I went beyond the language and the love story and saw the acting not even for a moment did I ever felt like they were acting and the cinematography The first time I heard a definition of what a film is I was told that it should be a chain of perfectly balanced photographs shots and this is the film to match the description Almost every shot has an idea behind it and combined with the music and the light effects the result is just a masterpiece And a masterpiece is just something that you must have in your collection of films
1,It seems a lot of Europeans and Americans see Indian movies for the wrong reason I see some people are complaining that this movie did not have any dance sequence A class apart from their Hindi counterparts Bengali movies tend to be more realistic Rituparno Ghosh is one of the best young directors in India being widely known for his choice of subjects for the movies and the strength of his scripts Chokher bali is a perfect example A faithful adaptation of the Nobel laureate Tagores novel dealing with the pursuit of sexual pleasure of a Bengali widow the director gives a new dimension to the much acclaimed and controversial work
1,Holy Schnikey This Movie rocks The duo of Chris Farley and David Spade are great together My Favorite parts are Fat Guy in a little coat Oh my gosh Room service and more scenes that will be remembered for years to come This movie has a huge cult following I wonder why which proves that even eleven years after Chris Farleys tragic death and he still is popular He plays Tommy which will make you laugh every time you still watch it He is a great comedian and is missed Mr spade reminds me of Dan Akyroid while Chris Farley reminds me of John Belushi They done more than 2 movies together This Movie is a must buy and should be in every Snl fans collection
1,Talkshow with Spike Feresten is one of those shows that will definitely polarize audiences Either you like it or you dont Personally I find most of the bits hilarious but it does have some huh moments  Staples like Idiot Paparazzi are always good for a laugh but my alltime favorite bit has to be the oneoff Hollywood Douchebag Comedy for Stoners is the only regular bit that generally leaves me confused which is part of the point Spike and his team of writers manage to churn out loads of fresh comedy time after time so the show never feels stale Ferestens brand of humor may not be for everyone but its definitely worth trying The masses have spoken We like this show and want more Please note I am not a friend of or affiliated in any way with Spike Feresten Talkshow with Spike Feresten staff or Fox network and affiliates Its just plain funny
1,The Egyptian is set during the reign of one of the most fascinating figures of the ancient world the Pharaoh Akhnaton who thirteen centuries before Christ attempted to introduce a monotheistic religion Atenism to ancient Egypt The main character however is not Akhnaton but rather the fictitious Sinuhe As a baby Sinuhe is found mysteriously floating in a basket on the river Nile and adopted by the physician Senmut and his wife When he grows to manhood he follows his adopted father into the medical profession initially working as his father did among the poor of the city but he comes to prominence after he and his friend the ambitious young soldier Horemheb save the Pharaohs life while on a hunting expedition in the desert Sinuhe is appointed Court physician but becomes obsessed with the Babylonian courtesan Nefer Sinuhe not only ruins himself in a vain attempt to win her love but is also disgraced when his neglect of his duties means that he is unable to save the life of Akhnatons daughter Sinuhe flees into exile where he achieves success as a healer in neighbouring countries but returns to Egypt when he learns of a Hittite plot to invade Although Akhnaton readily forgives him for his previous offences Sinuhe finds the country in turmoil The Pharaohs attempts to introduce a new religion have led to civil strife between his followers and those of the priests of the old polytheistic faith and he is too pacific by nature to take any steps to confront the Hittite threat Sinuhe becomes embroiled in a plot by Horemheb now the general of the Egyptian army and Akhnatons sister Princess Baketamon to overthrow the Pharaoh and replace him with a more effective monarch The films weaknesses arise mostly from its two romantic subplots In the course of the film Sinuhe is revealed as the longlost son of the previous Pharaoh and halfbrother to Akhnaton and Baketamon It might therefore surprise a modern audience that she should fall in love with him marriage between brothers and sisters were not necessarily considered as incestuous by the standards of Egyptian royalty but the standards of 1950s cinema audiences were generally less liberal on this point In any case the HoremhebBaketamonSinuhe love triangle is an unnecessary complication and detracts from Baketamons role in the film that of the voice of coldeyed cynical Realpolitik The Nefer subplot which takes up most of the first hour of the film is overwritten and excessively melodramatic Nefer is morally worthless but fascinating and the role needed an actress of great beauty and also great dramatic skill to make her credible especially as Nefer achieves the difficult task of winning Sinuhe away from a woman as lovely as Jean Simmons who plays Merit Sinuhes rival for her affections It is therefore unfortunate that the role went to an actress as comically inept as Bella Darvi whose only qualification was that she was the mistress of the producer Darryl F Zanuck Darvi was not only a wooden actress but also spoke with a thick foreign accent made even more incomprehensible by a lisp She was not even particularly attractive by comparison with the two legendary Hollywood beauties in the film Simmons and Gene Tierney who plays Baketamon The film is better when it concentrates on its main political and religious themes The other actors are better than Darvi although Peter Ustinov as Sinuhes servant Kaptah makes the same mistake as in Spartacus that of trying to bring comic relief into a film that does not need it His voice anyway was far too patrician for a comic servant role Edmund Purdom a littleknown British actor was thrust into the main role when Marlon Brando pulled out at the last minute but more than adequately fills the great mans shoes even though his style of acting was quite different He copes well with the challenge of showing the changes in Sinuhes character from unworldly idealist to lovesick fool to embittered cynic to the enlightened visionary of the final scenes Victor Mature was never the most expressive of actors but he is wellsuited to the role of Horemheb a practical downtoearth man of action He is better here than he was in his other epic from 1954 Demetrius and the Gladiators Simmons is luminously beautiful as Merit Michael Wilding hitherto best known to me as the second Mr Elizabeth Taylor plays Akhnaton as a wouldbe philosopherking who ends as a sort of holy fool His inability to make difficult decisions makes him an unsuitable ruler but he has a prophetic vision of peace and justice which lend him an air of moral greatness far beyond those who hope to replace him on the throne Although Aten had more in common with the Supreme Being of the Deists than with the Old Testament Jehovah or the Trinitarian Christian God there is a quite deliberate attempt to draw parallels between Atenism and Christianity In the film the Atenist symbol is the ankh doubtless chosen because of its resemblance to a cross but in reality it was a common Egyptian hieroglyph for life not unique to Atenism Akhnatons language often has a Biblical ring to it his comparison of himself to wind whistling in the desert recalls John the Baptists voice crying in the wilderness hence the title of this review Sinuhes finding in the river parallels the Old Testament story of Moses At the end of the film Sinuhe who has become the inheritor of the spirit of the dead Akhnaton achieves a moral greatness of his own The message of the film is that while we may need practical men of action like Horemheb we also need visionaries and thinkers who are prepared to ask the question why For all its faults The Egyptian is a film which is idealistic and humane in its approach to both religion and politics 710

1,only few can understand Lelands character and to do that u most likely are inborn to see both sides of lifeand to face this reality is very hard and can lead some few to bad actslike Lelands character doesbut for such sad and real reasons that his intentions were goodin the sense that the intention to save another from physical or mentalin this casepain over long time and it is really sad how mostly everyone in this movie makes mistakes in it but the one character to make one through good intentions is killed by it the lesson of this movie is for the unique person to seerealizeface and make right of the real life situation u see and to make rightor inspire one who can make right of a wrong situation but before thatu have to see both sides of something and rationalize it for the sake of long peaceand tranquility of all human lifeakaDont BE IGNORANT
1,Ive heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that Paris Hilton was in it as well didnt give Me the best impression of the film  then to be dragged to the cinema by a group of my friends and sit there expecting a pile of pants i was shocked to find that i was scared stiff all the way through the film  it was predictable yes but the build up of the deaths and the whole atmosphere of the film made it REALLY scary for me  i was watching through my fingers the whole way through So i say go watch it and decide for yourself and if the fact that its a scary film doesnt convince you to go watch it then it also has Chad Michael Murray in it which cant be bad to watch for a couple of hours eh
1,Why couldnt the end of the movie have been Sean Connerys men fighting the French instead of the Germans Ever since the French had occupied Algeria in 1830 the tribes from Morocco and those of Algeria were making raids on the French military and civilian settlements This movie could have been a continuous of that historical aspect where the French had seize the Rasuadli so his followers would not be raiding Algeria and then his followers would have attacked the French to free him The movie is still stereotypical of shootouts between the Germans and the Americans When the Americans shoot the Germans their guns even the pistols make loud noises create large bloody bullet wounds and their enemies are screaming after being shot When Germans shoot at the Americans their guns dont make large sounds do not create bloody wounds and their enemies make little or no sound after being shot In real life the American Krag rifle was the worst rifle America had ever produce until the early version of the M16 came along The Krag was hard to maintain not reliable and the rifle bolt was always jamming The German Mauser was one of the worlds finest rifles We were so impress by it during Spanish American war that we made a copy of it and call it the Springfield rifle Finally the people of Morocco must had a word for artillery since the French were using them in their raids against Morocco I didnt like it when they made the Rasuldai feel stupid that there was no word for artillery in the Moorican vocabulary Instead the Rasuadli stated that the Europeans had guns on wheels that make the ground shake
1,Im seldom partial to movies about smartassed teenagers who have problems with authority but Toy Soldiers has grown on me with repeated viewings This is as much a movie about Billy Tepper growing up and becoming an adult as anything else and I give credit to Sean Astin and writerdirector Daniel Petrie Jr that they dont make a big deal of that but let it just unfold and sneak up on you The camaraderie of Teppers friends their grief over Joeys death and their joy at their survival all are genuinely moving And I have to admit I take a certain patriotic and perhaps slightly reptilian glee when the US Army guys finally move in and righteously kick some narcoterrorist butt Oohrah General Kramer And the heroic Robert Folk score is the cherry on top Im sure I could find a hundred reasons not to like Toy Soldiers but as long as we dont take it TOO seriously I dont see the need This is one of the most entertaining bad movies in my pantheon
1,This film is so lovingly made you want to be part of it forever The flics are straight but not without malice the goods are transparent and evildoers are hardly there Even the cabaret are so naive theyll make you daydream with nostalgia in comparison to anything available on TV Blier is fine if a bit one sided Louis Jouvet is perfect you just cant have a better copper He has the best line My dad cleaned other peoples dirt and I do the same Susy Delair is unbearable but I guess in part its the songs wardrobe and hairdo Simone Renant on the contrary makes a great femme fatale if a bit silent I didnt realize she may be a lesbian as IMDb user dbdumonteil and others rightly suggest
1,This is probably one of the best French movies I had seen in a very long time This pastiche or parody of spy movies is very well made and is going to make you laugh from the beginning to the end Some references to todays world are very subtle The whole Maroccan context of the movie is to be understood in light of todays French cultureenvironment That said all the jokes and  seemingly  shocking remarks that could have been understood as such because of this context are permitted and accepted because this is a parody  I was told by my sisters who had already seen this movie that I should go too and assured me that I was going to have a great time and indeed I had If you liked the old 007 movies with Sean Connery and also like movies like Airplane or Hot Shots you will be delighted I just hope this movie is released on DVD in the US Wait and see
1,Awww I love this The Tale of the Cat and the Moon doesnt really need an synopsis as thats what it is the cat chasing the moon to a Spanish poem Its the artistry thats interesting In fact there was this animated short called the Fan and the Flower that was an Academy Award winner last year 2005 yeah almost same thing which leads me to believe it might just be a rip off But this is a really good short with stark black  white shapes shifting and transitioning into beautiful motion and poetic seduction If you believe cats are poetry in motion see this and youll believe it more Also it has such a touching end PolarisDiB
1,This movie is good for entertainment purposes but it is not historically reliable If you are looking for a movie and thinking to yourself Oh I want to learn more about Custers life and his last stand do not rent They Died with Their Boots On But if you would like to watch a movie for the enjoyment of an older western film with a little bit of romance and just for a good story this is a fun movie to watch The story starts out with Custers Errol Flynn first day at West Point Everyone loves his charming personality which allows him to get away with most everything The movie follows his career from West Point and his many battles including his battle in the Civil War The movie ends with his last stand at Little Big Horn In between the battle scenes he finds love and marriage with Libby Olivia De Havilland Errol Flynn portrays the arrogant but suave George Armstrong Custer well Olivia De Havilland plays the cute sweet Libby very well especially in the flirting scene that Custer and Libby first meet Their chemistry on screen made you believe in their romance The acting in general was impressive especially the comedic role  although stereotypical of Callie played by Hattie McDaniel Her character will definitely make you laugh The heroic war music brought out the excitement of the battle scenes The beautiful costumes set the tone of the era The script at times was corny although the movie was still enjoyable to watch The directors portrayal of Custer was as a hero and history shows this is debatable Some will watch this movie and see Custer as a hero Others will watch this movie and learn hate him I give it a thumbs up for this 1942 western film
1,this is the best movie i have ever seen and i love it very much is is so sad and loving i could watch this movie over and over again when i first seen it on Disney channel i was like i would love to see this movie again i would love to watch this movie everyday and i recommend it to anyone this is really a good movie to anyone who has not seen this movie and is thinking about it they better go and see it because it is really good i love the part when the boy found out about the girl and from then on i was just all into this movie if i could watch two movies everyday it would be this one and beloved those are my two favorite movies i really love them
1,Ive read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark Ive noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical buddy film De Niro is in no way Murphys buddy throughout most of this movie In fact part of the comedy of this film is De Niros reluctance to be friends with anybody Murphy really shines in this one He is back at doing what he does best acting like a complete ham He is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show De Niro is perfect as the straight man who thinks the entire thing is stupid I thought the two of them had great chemistry and were a perfect casting choice Rene Russo is also great as the TV producer Of course she loves everything Murphy does and tries so hard along with Murhpy to get DeNiro going too A lot of reviewers have touched on the hilarious scene with William Shatner reprising his role as TJ Hooker to train Murhpy  De Niro how to act like cops But my favorite scene involves Murphy in the confessional hoping he could get a Wesly SnipesLike cop to team up with instead of De Niro Man that was hilarious Comedies often depend on your personal tastes Sure you could poke holes in the plot most often you can with a comedy I was psyched to see the pairing of Murphy and De NiroI think it brought out the best in Murphy which was nice to see him at the top of his game again I can only imagine it was a great honor for Murphy to be paired with the great De Niro Rating 8 of 10 stars
1,What a movie I have always liked the Asian style of shooting and this movie does not disappoint at all Photography is breathtaking ranging from amazing landscapes to whirls of colours The main actor is really realistic in representing the painter whose paintings are astonishing The ending is also very well chosen very poetic The only remark is that they should have maybe shown a bit more deeply the connection between his inspiration and his abuse of alcohol and women But altogether this is an excellent film
1,Being a fan of Saint Etienne and the City of London I was very excited to see this movie on the list of the Vancouver International Film Festival This movie has great shots an absolutely excellent soundtrack and interesting insights into a not so well known London The movie is held completely in dark colours which I personally dont like too much Furthermore the narration was a little too British and the comments sometimes got a little flat Other than that there are some great comments by Londoners and excellent shots FINISTERRE doesnt glorify London by showing all the great attractions of the city but rather gives deep insights in what London is really like From the East end to the vibrant centre with its music scene as well as the special little retreats for Londoners All in all Great Soundtrack Nice shots great insights Narration Tiering to watch at times Very dark picture Worth watching I give it a 710
1,The 2005 edition of the Royal Rumble came live from the Save Mart Centre in Fresno California The two top Championships of the WWE were being defended The Undertaker was battling Heidenreich in a Casket match Shawn Michaels was taking on Edge in a grudge match that had been building up since last October and of course the every man for himself over the top rope Royal Rumble match itself Who was going to take the price this year Chris Benoit Edge Eddie Guerrero Edge John Cena Batista Edge Shawn Michaels There was no shortage of contenders It was Batista that picked up the popular victory in the main event battle but not without controversy or should I say a botched finish Batista and John Cena were the final two men in the ring Batista was supposed to dump the young Smackdown star over the top rope but it all went wrong and they both went toppling to the floor The referees acted on their feet as we had an armraising contest similar to that of Bret hart and Lex Luger back in 1994 This brought out the chairman of the board Vinnie Mac walked down to the ring the way only he can but injured himself badly getting into the ring It was unusual to see Vince McMahon sitting legs out telling the two men to restart the match Batista then did was he was supposed to do first time round and dumped Cena to the floor sealing his own future with a Championship match at WrestleMania 21 The undercard for this years Royal Rumble had a very solid line up with many of WWEs biggest stars competing in matches Each brand had two big matches each Raw opened the night with the match between Shawn Michaels and Edge This was a good technical contest Back and fourth all the way until Edge got the pinfall This was a smart booking decision and kept Edge as a contender to the World Heavyweight Championship The second match of the night was the feud ending Casket match between The Undertaker and Heidenreich The match was not a classic but then again have their been any classic Casket matches It was entertaining Especially when Snitsky got involved and then Kane popped out the casket to a great pop The Undertaker surprised no one when he got the win slamming the lid on Heidenreich and this mediocre feud The first of the two Championship matches of the night was John Bradshaw Layfields defence of the WWE Championship in a triple Threat match against both Kurt Angle and the Big Show This match was very good Again not a classic but entertaining none the less JBL took the win after pinning Kurt Angle His celebration was short lived however when backstage teddy Long informed him at No Way Out he would defend the WWE Championship in a Barbed Wire Steel cage match against Big Show Not a very nice way to spend a Sunday night And of course there is no show without Punch Punch of course being reigning World Heavyweight Champion Triple H His rematch from Unforgiven 2004 with Randy Orton was lot better than the original encounter Its a pity because they just dont seem to click to well in the ring and this would be an excellent feud if they did Orton played the concussion role very well and went down in defeat to The Game So the first big one of 2005 was a good one It achieved its goals Feuds ended and new ones began We were now officially on the road to WrestleMania 21
1,The answerNo sadly not Though miller and the sweep has to be hailed as a most whimsical cinematic treatThe drama suspenseromance and the unidentified crowd at the end all add to the films complex storyline which must have been too much for the audiences of 1898 A enlightening experience one for all the family
1,As a former Erasmus student I enjoyed this film very much It was so realistic and funny It really picked up the spirit that exists among Erasmus students I hope many other students will follow this experience too However I wonder if this movie is all that interesting to watch for people with no international experience But at least one of my friends who has never gone on Erasmus also enjoyed it very much I give it 9 out of 10
1,I just saw Everything is Illuminated at the Telluride Film Festival This is a truly remarkable film Very emotional funny at times and heartwarming Bring your handkerchiefs For those of you who enjoy a movie that brings tears to your eyes Im reminded of the endings of Babettes Feast and The Notebook The stories were completely different but had that same emotional power to bring tears to my eyes just as this film did No spoilers here The summary is as IMDb describes a young mans journey to the Ukraine to follow his roots and find the village where his father grew up The dialog is in English and Ukrainian and Russian too I believe This allows for some wonderfully linguisticallybased moments as one character interprets more or less faithfully for the English speaker in the group depending on the circumstances The scenery is wonderful and the musical score is a treat with wonderful Eastern European influences Be sure you stay through the credits for the final tune This is Lieve Schreibers directorial debut and is well done I give this film a 9 one of the best films Ive seen in a long time I recommend it highly
1,Now lissen you guys I LOVED THIS FILM though not quite as much as FAREWELL TO THE KING another beloved John Milius epic It was fun a lot more than if it were based on a Tennessee Williams drama Its a great yarn with a whiff of political correctness I love this film for its beautiful photography its humor and its attenuated criticism of the Bad Guys Berbers and the REAL Bad Guys the spear carriers for the acquisitive civilized world with their repeating rifles artillery and large gunboats out there in the harbor  The standout scene is the Berber encampment with bluegray smoke from the cooking fires rising into the chill desert air It is visually eloquent highly evocative Set in 1904 Morocco WIND features a helpless American woman Candace Bergen who is taken hostage by a dashing albeit immodest Berber bandit Sean Connerythe very model ofa Scottish Muslim nomad The exciting story is based on a few historical facts The photography is Milius beautiful punctuated by Jerry Goldsmiths outstanding score Mrs Pedicaris and the Raisuli conduct protracted foreplay and bounce around in the desert between oases Even though the Raisuli proudly traces his lineage back to the apes he is a perfect gentleman  he even lets her keep her head after she beats him at chess A Marine detachment storms the Bashaws palace putting out the fires of competing hegemonies with gasoline Dont mess with the Corps Abdul  There are many entertaining stereotypes Despicable Sultan  resembles a dissipated ferret Definitely not a Liberal Cruel German Officer  a large bellicose Dachshund sporting a monocle He gallantly chooses to fight the Raisuli with swords instead of gunning him down in the manner of Indiana Jones Noblesse oblige by way of Von Clausewitz Dashing Marine Officer  kicks the crap out of the Bashaw of Tangiers army and storms his palace while chewing tobacco His speech is mildly aphasic The Bashaw begged him not to breathe on him The Berbers  a horde of groveling sycophants led by a charming megalomaniac None of them take baths except perhaps in camel urine President Teddy Roosevelt is undeservedly portrayed as vacuous and preoccupied with guns toys and stuffed grizzly bears Beautiful American widow  gives the men a lesson in courage as do her two children She evidently has a huge supply of clean starched clothes and rarely has a hair out of place  The Raisuli sends Teddy Roosevelt a message thanking him for the gift of a Remington repeating rifle declaring MEESTER ROOSEVELT YOU ARE THE LION AND AIEE AM THE BREAKING WIND How true Please do not take my acerbic remarks to mean that I did not like the film I had almost as much fun writing this as watching da Pitcher
1,I enjoyed this movie okay it just could have been so much better I was expecting more action than what I gotwhich was more of a comedy than anything else Granted it was serious in parts and it had a good fight scene here and there for the most part it was more romance and comedy with some action and no horror at all Which is hard to do with a vampire movie A vampire hunter loses his partner and must train another his sister is going through a difficult break up but she is being pursued by a vampire of all things Granted this vampire is rather nice and not into sucking blood So that is all there is really to it except for a plot of another vampire after certain royal vampires so he can gain ultimate power Some of the problems with this movie is that its plot went here and there and the movie had a very uneven flow to it that and it seemed to shift genres a bit much too One minute action the next pure comedy However the girls were cute there is good action the comedy was worthy of a chuckle or two and Jackie Chan makes a rather energetic appearance or two This movie probably just needed more development in some areas such as the villain who is basically not really explored at all So for a movie with a few good fights and a chuckle or two this is rather goodthough why was it rated R I have seen stuff we have made that is PG13 that is a lot worse than this
1,At the beginning of this film which I found myself watching on IFC in the wee hours of the morning I was filled with a sense of claustrophobia and general discomfort The feeling of being trapped with no way to escape was so powerful that I didnt know if I wanted to continue watchingalthough it didnt really seem to me that I had much of a choice so compelling was the situation Gradually though that feeling of discomfort waned although it never really disappeared entirely and I felt drawn into Tessa  Bobbys predicaments and really just hoping against hope that they might get back together Really just a moving powerful story fit snugly into a tiny package I had no idea that Sarah Polley had anything to do with it until perusing her trivia so now I love it even more I definitely recommend it If your lucky enough to catch it on the Independent Film Channel sometime or wily enough to figure out some other way to view it
1,Stalingrad is a terrific movie well acted and directed and rather down to earth in its approach to the various bizarre aspects of warfare and its politics This is together with Das Boot one of the best war movies together with the Finnish Vinterkriget The Winter War in English I believe It depicts the ordeals of some of the German soldiers that fought  and died  in and around Stalingrad during World War 2 No big time heroics no over bearing emotional fuzziness only the fear of every day death in war The mood of the movie is similar to the one in Das Boot and that should give you some hints on what to expect I guess So if you enjoy realistic nonHollywoodish war movies Rent it buy it just make sure you see it Finally a film buffs note for some of the previous reviewers information I only want to add that Stalingrad isnt directed by Wolfgang Petersen who made Das Boot
1,LAppartement is I think a very purposeful Hitchcockian film The plot was rife with symbolism ie the white and red roses and plot twists which wrapped themselves up neatly The look was very Parisian and pulled you closer to the story I saw it in London and very much regret that it is not out on video in the states
1,its a good watch if u have time  deals with three friends who get into a needless bar fight and get into serious trouble they find themselves fighting some shadowy people and cant deal with very very disturbing portrayal of japan the arbitrariness of modern life some intense scenes but a bit of a potboiler the spoiler was that the plot is not too clear based on English sub titles obviously i dont know Japanese the only other Japanese movies ive seen were kurosawa who is a different and far loftier than this modern genre so cant really compare otherwise it compares better with most Hollywood blockbusters for story plot and buildup taptieg24
1,E Elias Merhiges existentialist experiment in the enduring is definitely one hell of a boring watch This is like something Alexander de Large was forced to watch in A Clockwork Orange But despite just how unwatchable this film really is it is a success If you are reading this and have not already seen the film then it is too late For me at least the payoff after 3 separate viewings with lots of break in between mind you was seeing the list of characters after the story was told Thats when the simple message hit home But i wonder if Merhige could have told a 5 minutes story in about 30 instead of 78 However seeing as how the cast of credits is displayed prominently on the front page for this movie the cat is already out of the bag and you surely will only appreciate this film if you appreciate existentialist film making from the early 20th century Even then you might puke 410 but i commend Merhige for crafted a piece of art even if it is unwatchable
1,I was 19 years old when I saw first saw this film in the theater I have a vivid memory of a different ending Not completely different but significantly I just watched the movie last night and I was wrong so I guess the following cant be called a spoiler since it never happened The ending I remember was that the boy was hiding in the house completely naked Frances Austen found him quite easily and after she confronted him she slowly sank to her knees and went down on him off camera Only his face was in the frame and it was pretty obvious he was letting it happen albeit against his will But nothing like this showed up in the movie Sandy Dennis was 32 years old when she made this movie Michael Burns was 22 In the movie he complains to his sister that Frances makes too big a deal about sex Yeah Well then so go to bed with her dude and get it over with WTF
1,Strong evidences and it clearly shows government coverups and lies Very convincing documentary A little bias but it hit hard on the government Im not very remorsed about the adults but the children its very sad Strong evidences and it clearly shows government coverups and lies Very convincing documentary A little bias but it hit hard on the government Im not very remorsed about the adults but the children its very sad Strong evidences and it clearly shows government coverups and lies Very convincing documentary A little bias but it hit hard on the government Im not very remorsed about the adults but the children its very sad
1,I recently was lucky enough to see The Kite Runner in a small theater surrounded by seasoned moviegoers who knew how to enjoy a masterpiece of such sophistication With all the controversy surrounding this films central scene these days I was expecting a piece both crude and violent But the way Mr Forster handled the delicate subject was touching and really deeply moving Even though the films credits indicated China as the main location for the shoot I could have sworn I was seeing Kabul throughout the scenes which are meant to be taking place in Afghanistan The acting by nonprofessionals as well as professional actors is excellent and the casting is magnificent So this is a movie I would see again and again because though it is undeniably sad in its subject the masterful way it has been made awakens a whole new hope in modern cinema
1,Because Mr Bean almost never speaks I heartily recommend using a DVD player with the teacher holding his finger over the pauseplay button At the end of any age groups lesson simply devote 5 minutes to pausing and playing the DVD encouraging students to shout out the answers to Whats this What will happen Whats happening Whats wrong or any other question that elicits responses from that lessons new vocabulary and grammar Because everyones looking at the TV normally shy students become vocal Because the DVD can be started or stopped at any point its a perfect filler for the awkward between times while students are leaving and arriving I tried other DVDs notably Tom  Jerry cartoons and Red Skelton DVDs but no others were as good as Mister Bean at holding students constant attention
1,Being a Wallace and Gromitfan I was looking forward for this fulllength movie Surprisingly I saw it at THE worldpremiere in Vlissingen NL at the Film by the Sea festival A wonderful feeling to be one of the first to see this very amusing and merry movie Its about Wallace and Gromit whom I believe dont need an introduction having their own pestcontrol company in the city which is hosting a giantvegetable contest in a few days Everyone including an eccentric baroness is hoping his or her giant carrot or melon will win the Golden carrot Unfortunately the town is plagued by lots of hungry rabbits This is where WG come in The have their own cracking contraptions to control these cute creatures in a human way Its a very funny and colorful story Anyone who liked the three proceeding short movies of WG which are more than great will love this fulllength movie Nick Park really delivered a wonderful and original result with a great sense for humor Like in Chicken Run it truly amazes me how he can capture so much story and emotions in just a few frames Job well done lad  Oh yeah The music was fantastic It really completes the ride Enjoy
1,I would hope so and how can I get involved This movie is a classic and ripe with laughs adventure and an all star 80s cast What happens when you get together a group of jocks and sororiety a group of debating nerds a band of misfits and couple of couselors A load of laughs that will have you begging for more David Naughton stars as Adam the leader of the yellow team a kind and hip college counselor who helps students with everything from getting the classes they want to first dates His nemesis is Harold the leader of the blue team played hilariously by Stephen Furst of Babylon 5 fame the no good loafing son of a wealthy former college jock with enough trophies to make any hall of famer jealous Pit these two against each other and throw in a red team a white team and a green team an unbelievable view at an observatory consequences of cheating at minature golf a super tour at the Pabst Blue Ribbon beer factory and a hateful old landlady among other adventures and you have all the makings of a night to remember Look for appearances by Michael J Fox Eddie Deezen and director Andy Tennant in one of the last movies he acted in before becoming a director and you have an all star hilarious cast The only down side to this movie was Debra Clingers performance as Laura She terribly overacted but the rest of the movie is so good she can simply be ignored I own this movie and can never watch it enough 
1,Honestly I dont really understand why there has been so much controversy about this show It embraces the elements of the original while expanding on them The storytelling has been updated and while some of the episodes seem to be a bit Fast that is a good thing Christopher Eccleston is perfect in the role Easily as good as Tom Baker Rose is one of the best companions on par with Sarah Jane Smith or Leela I like the concept that the timelords have been destroyed  No more politicking with the Doctor acting as president emeritus And it adds something to the character to be the only one left The SFX are outstanding  especially in comparison to the original Take it from me And I was a huge Dr Who geek  I actually took notes while watching the show all the way from Dr Number 1 to Dr Number 8 I tossed the horrible movie out of cannon personally this is the best sci fi show on TV right now possibly ever Watch it and buy the DVD
1,i first saw this short when i bought a random DVD of short films a while ago this is the only short on the DVD i liked but i dont just like it i love it if you spend any amount of time with me you will see it it is beautiful simple and passionate no bells no whistles  it could have been done with a sharpie but dont get me wrong the animation is elegant and insightful  this person clearly spent plenty of time with cats  but it is simply black and white and then there is writing and the music it is simply beautiful i eat chocolate drink wine and watch it over and over again nothing else matters i wait for Pedro Serrazina to come up with something else
1,He plays straight but with a quiet intensity that makes him one of the top cops in movie history Roy Scheider stars in a poor mans French Connection that has a little of the same gritty appeal FC is a better movie but I prefer watching this one because 1 I think Scheider is great and this is his best movie and 2 this has the best car chase EVER one that makes Bullitt look like a cable production thanks again to Bill Hickman who actually plays the driver It doesnt hurt that Tony LoBianco stops by again to play a baddie Please enjoy
1,Of course I am going to think it was a great movie I recognized several people I didnt see during filming also I was the one playing the guard about an hour into the movie in the death row exercise yard asking for a light for a cigarette I also changed this one scene They had originally had it set to go into the rec yard and straighten out the inmate and turn him around and walk him out The Director said It is taking to long what would you do Gower I said We need to go in and hook the arms and drag him out backwards That way your camera can stay on his face as we take him off set I also lived at this same prison as a young child as my father was the Assistant Warden of Security I am also a current employee with the Tennessee Deaprtment of Corrections as a supervisor at the Riverbend Maximum Security Institution Even though a lot of the movie was a joke the part I was in was reality enough Also in the bar scene the dancer kicking high in the air and leaving the stage was an actual stripper I use to work with at a club called The Classic Cat
1,This is a funny intelligent and in a sense realistic comedy about a 14yearold trying to live her first love while on vacation and also about the complex sometimes amusing sometimes touching relation between a divorced father and her growing daughter and about how far a women not only Nicole the teenager can go to get the man she loves I laughed a lot with this lively scenario that never drags
1,This film easily rivals the emotional strength the dramatic impact and the topnotch performances of 12 Angry Men I rented it on a whim and was amazed that I had not heard of it before I do not know if this was Emilio Estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in At Play In The Fields Of The Lord She is irritating and yet one can empathize with her at the same time There are some moments where I feel the plot slows a touch and the moments between Estevez and his exgirlfriend almost seem written for another film Estevez comes off as another character all together But those are minor complaints This film must be based on a true story or must have been written by someone who lived these experiences I rate it 8 out of a difficult 10 
1,I just want To say that this movie was excellent  I loved it from the beginning until the end  The acting was great The director did an amazing job and I would like to see it again Jennifer Tilly did a very good performance  The guy that interpreted his father Manny was another great actor BUT I CAN NOT RECALL HIS NAME  I cant wait for El Padrino II Damian Chapa looks so good and I think he is one of the most talented actors out there There is pleanty of Latin actors that do a great job like it is shown in this film Rent It Rent it  Rent it 
1,Victor Mature as a barely civilized and mostly out of control mountain man and trapper may be on the poster but Robert Preston as a failed Union colonel who led his men to get cut to ribbons by Confederate artillery at Shiloh and is sent to a fort in Oregon for his incompetence has the most interesting part married to a young and hard to recognize at first Anne Bancroft The uncivilized Mature lusts for the colonels wife giving the film an interesting and even dark subplot which goes so far as to reference coveting another mans wife at one point by James Whitmore who plays Matures older and wiser mountain man father figure Directed by Anthony Mann this film is lost among his more famous westerns with James Stewart but even so you really dont need the Indian menace to make this a film worth seeing although Preston gets to prove his bad judgement as a commanding officer again in a failed expedition to finally bring the Indians under submission in a well staged attack among the forest that quickly turns into a rout
1,there is one of the best movies directed by andrzej wajdathat story told about young writer who is seekin his place after a second warhes survive german campexcellent true atmosphereaction goes in camp for displaced placedmain heroplayed by one of the best polish actor daniel olbrychski finally fall in love but unfortunately his lady has been killed there was beautiful scenewhen he is talking with american soldier and says about death his girlnothing is happensimply youre shootin to us now hes condition of soul has been destroyed 1010
1,I hate to say it but I really do think this ones overrated and I love Jackies films Its got more plot behind it than usual but unfortunately though it has some great stuff I find it to be a bit slow All in all I say its entertaining but not great
1,David Tennant and Sarah Parishs brilliant acting had me in tears as many of the scenes were so familiar to me My husband suffered a subarachnoid haemorrhage in 1977 and required a major operation which involved lifting his brain and plugging the leak Like Tricia I was naive enough to expect that he would return to being his former self After over 25 years of loving and caring for him he abandoned me without warning to go and live with a woman he hardly knew He then petitioned for and I am now going through a divorce I do hope the programme helped people to understand what it is like to cope with brain injury
1,Dolelemite 1975 is a cult classic Starring Rudy Ray Moore as the pimp superhero out to wrong rights whilst challenging the MAN along the way He has two enemies that no good Willie Green and the sleazy mayor Watch Dolemite kick punch slap and pimp his way across the screen Whats the mans name DOLEMITE Interesting film that paved the way for a generation of rappers and performers To sell more of his party albums Rudy Ray Moore made several on the cheap films during the seventies Self produced and marketed he catered towards a specific audience Some people call it blacksploitation others call it trash I call it entertaining Dolemite was followed by the semisequel The Human Tornado and a direct to video Return of Dolemite 25 years later Highly recommended a definite cult classic  Footnotes if the film was properly matted on video you wouldnt see the boom mikes Dolemite was cut to receive an Rrating
1,A German freshman Stefan hitch hikes to Paris during summer break were he falls for a mysterious young woman he meets in the Paris freak scene He then follows her in the famous isle of Ibiza the hippie joint were meets Wolf a man who throws HitlerJugend knives owns bars and hotels and keeps Estelle under his thumb with dope The couple tries to escape Wolf Stefan gets hooked with dope and jealousy for Estelle whos groovy and a free spirit Great photography and music plot is quite usual for the period but its not an exploitation kind of movie cold and dramatic The moral is quite strong he was looking for the sun but I would not say its a film against drugs even it puts enphasy on drug use
1,Doppleganger  or Journey To The Far Side Of The Sun as it is more commonly known  was written  with input by the late Donald James  and produced by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson best known for their Supermarionation television shows such as Thunderbirds The international space agency Eurosec discovers the existence of a mysterious planet on the other side of the sun and proposes a manned flight be sent there The committee balk at the exhorbitant cost and shelve the project But when a security leak at the agency is discovered fearing that the Russians might get there first the project gets the green light American astronaut Glenn Ross  Roy Thinnes  is teamed with British scientist John Kane  Ian Hendry  After weeks of gruelling training the Phoenix blasts off heading for the unknown Three weeks later their ship crashes in what appears to be a bleak mountainous landscape Ross survives but Kane is badly injured A light is seen moving towards them I will leave the synopsis here Until this point the film has been gripping with excellent special effects  by Derek Meddings  and music by Andersons resident composer Barry Gray  why it has not been issued on CD is a mystery  But when Ross and Kane crash land and we discover the secret of the alien world  it is a duplicate of our own everyone on it is the same the only major difference is that things are reversed  it becomes less interesting and ends with a shattering anticlimax I think the cinema was the wrong place to do this idea in fact Gerry  Sylvia later did something similar on their Space 1999 show Ross risks  and ultimately loses  his life in an effort to return to Earth  his Earth But why The new Earth is so similar he might as well not have bothered Roy Thinnes had recently done The Invaders television series and gives a competent performance  pity there werent more scenes like the one where he rows with his wife  Ian Hendry is good as Kane but vanishes from the story too soon Several actors went on to appear in the Andersons UFO such as Ed Bishop and George Sewell Blink and you will miss Nicholas Courtney  The Brigadier from DrWho in a tiny role  But the acting honours go to the late Patrick Wymark as Jason Webb head of Eurosec The character is not far removed from Sir John Wilder the one he played in ATVs The Power Game Webb is such a devious character he is marvellous to watch Herbert Loms contribution  as a spy with a camera hidden in a false eye  amounts to little more than a cameo Like I said the special effects are marvellous as are the sets So the film is worth watching but do not expect very much to happen once the action moves to the mirror planet With a stronger script this could have been another Planet Of The Apes or  dare I say it  2001 A Space Odyssey In Andersons productions he made the future seem like a great place an adventure playground where science was cool everyone had swank cars whose doors opened vertically sexy women and absolutely no suggestion that anything is seriously wrong with the world We are in the future now and people are still watching Coronation Street every other night How disappointing If a mirror Earth really exists somewhere one hopes that is a better place than this one If all the women there look like Lynn Loring or Loni von Friedl I will be on the next flight
1,Thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow IMDb member Ive just managed to watch this film for the second time in nearly twenty years and I can honestly say it hasnt lost any of its kick I cant believe that Channel 4 have let this one vanish without a trace as it is an extremely powerful moving and moralistic take on the consequences of misplaced loyalty  It focuses on a clique of friends over the course of ten years and their relationship with two outsiders from school specifically how they use one and mercilessly torment the other As events from both the past and present unfold the tension gradually thickens not dissimilar to Shane Meadows excellent revengechiller Dead Mans Shoes The acting writing and direction are very bold for 1983 and still pack a wallop today in spite of the upper crust accents of the central characters Yes it might be set in public school but its worlds apart from anything put out by Merchant Ivory I got a state education and can still draw countless parables from the story  This is a film that youll remember for a long time if you see it  except you probably wont because Channel 4 or FilmFour have chosen to bury it On their own official website they describe it as an inexplicably overlooked gem from the early days of Channel 4  overlooked by who This was one of the very first Channel 4 films which would later go on to become FilmFour thanks to the success of films like Trainspotting so somewhere someone must still have the master print In these days where you can get extended collectors issue DVDs of more or less anything its a bit moody that they cant give a film this good the promotion it deserves  So if one of the Channel 4 production flunkies is reading this stop making programmes that showcase people humiliating themselves in the hope of securing a tabloid deal chase up this film and sort out a nice special anniversary edition disc or something please
1,The Hindi version of the film is 121 minutes Set in Bengal in the early 1900s the film based on Tagores novel draws an analogy between the British colonization of India and the subjugation of women An educated and beautiful woman Binodini becomes a widow within a year of her marriage but she does not accept the constraints imposed on her as a widow by her society The film has a beautiful look to it but perhaps Aishwarya Rai is out of her depth in portraying Binodinis strong character with its subtle combination of idealism and deviousness Binodinis idealism does not come across and as a result the analogy between women and colonization remains somewhat buried
1,Nice combination of the giant monster and samurai genres The giant monster Majin god of the mountain is an aloof and forbidding figure that comes across very much like the OldTestament God raining destruction and punishment on those who desecrate his holy ground  but its interesting to note that what finally awakens him is not the suffering of the people but a pointed and personal insult Its beautifully photographed with solid acting great miniatures and a wonderful score by the great Akira Ifukube Majin is not a 400 foot monster like Godzilla  hes 2 12 times normal size so the evil samurai he stomps into the ground get a good look into his contemptuous eyes as he bears down on their fortress and smashes it to smithereens Not much in terms of extras but its nice to see this forgotten minor classic rescued and restored to the digital format
1,This is a cut above other movies of the genre genuinely suspenseful intelligent brilliantly acted and visually stunning Yes the plot can be confusing  but thats partly what makes it pack such a punch Watch it twice if you can Youll get almost as much out of watching it when you know the twist than you do from watching it the first time Dont be put off by the fact that this film comes from Korea a country not too familiar to most Western audiences While there are elements of the film that are culturally specific the underlying themes are all too universal  guilt anger loss madness and retribution All of these are handled superbly by Lim Sujeong as Sumi the lead character Also worthy of particular mention is Yum Jungah who delivers a deeply creepy and unsettling performance as the stepmother  While it has its scary moments this is not really a horror flick as most people would imagine it Its more a psychological suspense story with an element of mystery It grips you from the start and will keep you guessing until the end  and possibly beyond
1,Cat In The Brain is a series of extremely violent sequences knitted together by a plot that feels more like an overview describing director Lucio Fulcis most notorious years of filmmaking The movie could also be seen as a dark comedy of sorts effectively spoofing the various claims that violent cinema causes violence in real life Fulci goes further than that he casts himself as the star the central figure of the film thus showing the audience who is the man behind all the cinematic gore Cat in The Brain is not about presenting a clear story and following it Instead it pokes fun at some of the clichés that have been surrounding the horror genre for years Lucio Fulci plays himself as a horror director struggling to keep his humanity intact Years of violent film making have finally began to reach him It starts slowly steaks and meat in general begin to disgust him his colleagues assure Fulci that all he needs is some rest But that doesnt help and soon the grotesque ideas for his movies begin to overwhelm his daily thoughts In an attempt to find a cure for his dangerously maddening mental state Lucio starts going to the local psychiatrist Unfortunately that does more wrong than good and Fulci is thrown into an even bigger mess as the psychiatrist turns out to be a psychopath who mimics the murders from Fulcis films in real life The film retains all the trademarks of Italian splatter cinema good or bad they are all here So any comments about the acting or the technical aspects and budget constrains are quite irrelevant as to the quality of the film It is a visual experience no doubts about it Fulci throws in an incredible amount of violence easily surpassing pretty much everything hes made Amputated by chainsaw limbs cannibalism child murder decapitation these are just some of the many grotesque acts witnessed in Cat In The Brain Some of them are obviously recycled from a few the directors less profile movies but they dont stand out of the context and actually feel quite at home here As I noted before the movie exists much better as a satire of the genre rather than a serious piece The way some of the violence is presented does help establish that idea Such sequences shortly after climax are rejected by the reality in the film as they are revealed to be actually scenes inside a movie that Fulcis character is directing This sort of film in film presentation lessens somewhat the impact of the gore But in no way does it make it an easy to watch film Oh no this is far beyond and above the levels of gore found in mainstream horror and gorehounds will in no doubt be satisfied with that fact Lucio Fulci was a very polarized figure People either hate his work or love it Cat in the Brain wont convince any of Fulcis detractors in the opposite but it is nevertheless an interesting part of his filmography One that fans should really check out
1,When I saw this film at a festival years ago I was very impressed and I started to looking for it Nothing to do not in the cinemas nor on DVD neither on Blue ray Absolutely nothing How its possible this could really happen The direction is IMPECCABLE the story is intriguing and has been filmed in a very original way the music its perfect and James Franco is hot as hell Please release this master piece and allow it to have its proper life This is really a very great movie that people should see and it deserve another chance  Edvard
1,This film easily rivals the emotional strength the dramatic impact and the topnotch performances of 12 Angry Men I rented it on a whim and was amazed that I had not heard of it before I do not know if this was Emilio Estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as the some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her characters in At Play In The Fields Of The Lord She is irritating and yet one can empathize with her at the same time There are some moments where I feel the plot slows a touch and the moments between Estevez and his exgirlfriend almost seem written for another film Estevez comes off as another character all together But those are minor complaints This film must be based on a true story or must have been written by someone who lived these experiences I rate it 8 out of a difficult 10 
1,The recent history of Hollywood remakes of ghosthorror films from the East has been dismal This film will inevitably suffer the same fate so get a copy on ebay or similar It is well photographed and the sound is superb Viewing on a good screen and with a good 51 or DTS enabled sound system is recommended Obviously it is subtitled so if that puts you off then I wouldnt bother with this Dubbing rarely works and simply would not do here It is also genuinely frightening with excellent performances from a cast who will be unfamiliar to Western audiences I would particularly single out the stepmother character who was utterly brilliant The ending will have you wanting to watch it again if you can cope The plot is relentless and offers no comforting moments of release along the way If I do have a small criticism there is perhaps a detectable influence in certain scenes from the Japanese version of The Ring We have however accepted straight copies of other peoples ideas for Western films for years and so my point is a limited one which did not prevent me from giving it 1010 I believe most fans of this genre will derive huge pleasure from this film which I for one hope goes down as a classic
1,I have some great memories watching Robin of Sherwood on TV as a kid but I think I only saw Michael Praed´s episodes by some reason And recently my brother bought the new released DVDboxes of the complete series It was great to see it again and it is the best of all the Robin Hood movies and TVseries The cast is great and the locations mixed with Clannad´s music adds this very special feeling I personally think that Praed is the best of the two Robins but Jason Connery was a great choice to continue the series with Ray Winstone Nicolas Grace and Robert Addie is terrific in their roles as Will Scarlet The Sheriff of Nottingham and Guy of Gisburne It´s a pity that a fourth season never got made and I´ve also heard that the writer Richard Carpenter actually had plans to make a feature film following the events of the series Robert of Huntingdon Connery could finally have married Marion Judi Trott or maybe Herne the Hunter could resurrect Robin of Loxley Praed and he could take his revenge against the sheriff As have been mentioned before if the producers of Robin Hood The Prince of Thieves would have been smart they would have got the cast from Robin of Sherwood and made the movie to a sort of sequel to the series As Ray Winstone puts it in the DVD bonusmaterial it would have been great to see them as old men just like in Sean Connery´s Robin and Marian Who knows maybe we will se more of this perfect interpretation of the legend in the future In any case we can now watch our favorite series over and over again
1,For only doing a few movies with his life the Late Great Chris Farley Farley died at the end of 1997 and will be missed mostly by his co actor in Tommy Boy David Spade From the lame Police Academy 4 Spade really has done good with his career in films Tommy Boy is a classic and we will always remember Chris Farley when we watch it From appearing on Saturday NIGHT LIVE to doing Tommy Boy Black Sheep Beverley Hills Ninja Almost Heroes Billy Madison and Dirty Work I think Chris Farley had a short and successful career Tommy Boy was his best in my case and I would watch over and over again and laugh at the same part each time Thank you Chris Farley
1,Sharkys Machine is clearly a Burt Reynolds vehicle designed to allow the star room to strut his talents and he spraypaints the machine the film plot with colors from other films and other styles offering a variety of moods within a nourish story Made in 1981 at 119 minutes lengthy for the time period the film did well with box office grosses at 37800000 It had a lot going for it Burt Reynolds actor and director a solid onetwo punch a William Diel novel adaptation and the south land of Atlanta Georgia at this time a land of opportunity for film production out of Hollywood Reynolds Tom Sharky falling in love with Rachel Wards Dominoe the hookerwithaheartofgold is here echoed as it was in Hustle when he played opposite Catherine Deneuve and that film also had a corrupt politician at its core but with downbeat ending not the Hollywood happiness in Sharkys Machine The story is pure Detective procedureactioner Sharky a narcotics detective mismanages up a bust of a drug dealer causing the killing of some innocent bystanders and gets demoted literally transferred downstairs to vice to deal with perverts and other m misdemeanors that upstanding cops consider latrine duty His new digs offers him the chance to meet many equally upstanding officers who are doing the dirty jobs no one else wants When some attention is pointed toward a certain pimp Sharky looks over some evidence and discovers that one particular prostitute Dominoe Rachel Ward  Dominoe is being shielded by police forces and political forces and Sharky sets himself up a 24hour surveillance force to watch her During the time he watches he learns that the current Governorelect Hotchkins Earl Holliman is visiting Dominoe as is a slick Italian gangster Victor Vittorio Gassman Before the police can build a case with the evidence Billy Victors brother a cokesnorting gunman Henry Silva shoots through the door of Dominoes apartment seemingly killing the beautiful Dominoe but when Sharky discovers that the murdered victim was actually a roommate Tiffany Aarika Wells Sharky confronts Victor and tells him that he is going to have him arrested Sharky is captured by some Ninja killers lead by Smiley Darryl Hickman and is tortured for information to lead to Dominoe but Sharky overpowers them and arrests the Governor and in a heated chase kills Billy after he has killed Victor Reynolds wants to exhibit the inner workings of a hardened policemen falling in love but the policestory plot flavored with noir element and Reynolds ability at cinematic development tends to slick over the dynamics of the relationships We come to learn something about some of the men and this leads us to reason why they are working towards their pensions in vice instead of fighting real crime this element of the film seems sketchy under Reynolds offhanded direction and performance There is always uniqueness to a Reynolds film He likes to hire stars either character actors or others and then allow them to improvise sometimes with varying results With his crew in Sharkys Machine he gets some fine moments and sometimes some overblown grandstanding but always a sense of ensemble and goodnaturedness With Reynolds as auteur it works Reynolds the actorauteur always seems to be smirking at himself and the viewer as if to say its all fake but good fun Great line In the scene with Victor when Sharky throws down the gauntlet Youre walkin all over people like you own em and you wanna know the worst part Youre from out of state This seems to be the greatest insult the officer can throw at a criminal Reynolds made the film in Atlanta at his career point have shot himself reading the phone book and would have surely targeted and demographic The film did mark the appearance of Rachel Ward who was nominated as New Star of the Year in 1981 by the Golden Globe Reynolds has always had presence and star power and has chosen to make films close to home Georgia I got my DVD from halfcom for 799 and unfortunately it doesnt contain any commentary or makingof features which is a shame Maybe the next generation will have them The movie is still a lot of fun and both Reynolds and Ward are greatlooking actors in their prime
1,Farscape  is the one SciFi Show which restarted the Interest in Science Fiction in me But Farscape is so much more then plain and simple SciFi Comedy Drama and much more  The Acting is very good Luckily Farscape survived also its cancellation and showed with Peacekeeper Wars that it is not dead yet  I hope there is a future for Farscape  In my opinion it is also not problematic that some of the characters in the Show are muppets You have to look behind that and you will see what a beauty Farscape is Farscape set a new Standard in Television and i think it will be truly hard for new shows to prove that they can be equal or better than Farscape I love this Show  SaphirJD
1,This is a great comedy highlighting what it was like to live next door to racist bigot But also shows that both main characters are actually as bad as each other Based on the hit ITV comedy this is very politically incorrect And its all the better for it comedy after all is to entertain The movies only real drawback is there isnt much of a plot However the cast are as great as usual Jack Smethurst and Rudolph Walker make one hell of a team playing off each other in a oneupmanship kind of wayIts been many years since i saw this movie and last week was finally able to buy it on dvd The fact that the movie still contains genuine laugh out loud moments means that i can recommend this movie just like i would of back in the 1970s
1,Messiah was compulsive viewing from start to finish The story centred on apparently random murders of men in London in various gruesome ways DCI Red Metcalfe Ken Stotthas to find the truth which to his surprise is a little closer to home than he might think Gripping drama and Ken Stott was brilliant Hopefully we have not seen the last of DCI Red Metcalfe
1,Spike Feresten is a comic genius Talkshow demonstrates a fresh take on the kind of odd ball irreverence that have made shows like Letterman and The Daily Show successful His likability is palpable He seems to find the unique angle of the joke not the predictable sitcom paththank God His comedy is reminiscent of the award winning Arrested Development cross your fingers that Talkshow has a longer life span The topics he highlights tend to be those things that pass by unnoticed by everyone else yet when he creates a joke around them out you wonder how you missed it the first time around I particularly enjoyed the sketchesUnfair Target will be a cult classic in no time Set your Tivos peoplethis is a show not to be missed
1,It would be great if a discussion on this medium length film is initiated with a brief tale about hypocrisy of Hollywood peopleIt was in 1988 that Chuck Norris saw this film at Cannes International Film FestivalHe made a silly remark by uttering that the senseless killing depicted in Dekalog 5 is far more effective than killings which have been filmed in his Hollywood films with him as a potent action starHe was speaking about an innocent taxi driver whose face is brutally disfigured in Kieslowskis film by a reckless psychopath who hits him cruelly with a big stoneThere should be absolutely no justification for violence and its perpetrators in a dignified human societyThis is the reason why Chuck Norris statement appears as a cruel joke which defends violent means in a society which is increasing becoming restlessAn honest reviewer would not be making a mistake if heshe states that Kieslowskis film Dekalog DekalogPiec 15 has universal connotationsThis is because the events depicted in Dekalog 5 can happen in any part of worldThe best lesson which Kielowski gives to us concerns levels of violence which are acceptable in a just societyThis is the reason why the brutal slaying of an innocent cab driver is capable of causing a feeling of repugnance in usWe would not feel the same hatred for homicide when it appears in films featuring Arnold SchwarzeneggerChuck Norris and Jean Claude Van Damme as they appear much too artificialOne can easily grasp that special effects and modern studio techniques can charm only toddlers but make no sense to serious film enthusiastsKieslowski also champions helplessness of human beings in rescuing fellow humans beings from the clutches of death and miseryThis is particularly interesting as time and again it has been proved that strict laws and capital punishments have not been able to prevent homicide
1,One of the major successes to The Decline of Western Civilization filmmaker Penelope Spheeris indie breakthrough is that it can perhaps appeal to nonpunk fans as to the hardcore ones More importantly it captures a moment in history before the movement became completely marketworthy when bands would play or at the least try to play in some cases in dank dirty clubs to an audience that had as much selfrespect as they had respect for the bands For the fan such as myself there are precious interviews with some of the quasilegends of LAs punkscum some dead some still living and still hardworking in the scene  Performances and interviews include the likes of The Circle Jerks X Black Flag in the preHenry Rollins days Catholic Discipline Fear the Alice Bag Band and most memorable in my opinion being the Germs While I knew of a few of the bands and performers in the film The Jerks and Black Flag mostly I had only heard rumors about lead singer the late Darby Crash and from the footage in the film he seems to be one of the if not the epitomes of the punk movement He doesnt take himself too seriously he loves to drink sometimes when he speaks its complete gibberish and the attitude he brings on stage is both funny and in a freeform way exhilarating A performer like that would probably scare Steve Miller and Jackson Browne out of their skins Decline of Western Civilization may not turn on every nonpunk fan that seeks this film out its hard to find on video but it shouldnt necessarily turn them off either Like a kind of anthropologist thats sneaked into the party Spheeris gets the behavior of these people down pat their motives their likes and hatreds and the power that was their on and offscreen personas A few of them almost come off as normal some dont but theyre only offensive to those who arent too open to things On top of that the film is a mustsee to the kinds of kids that think theyre punk fans just because they listen to Good Charlotte and Blink182 if you want to get the real scoop on the movement and genre of rock you profess to love give the pioneers a chance A
1,East Side Story entertains and informs about an unknown part of Cold War history What is the purpose of any documentary To inform the reader through commentary and footage This one succeeds at both You will never find many movies whose clips you get to see in here because some of them have been destroyed and some are unaccessible You get to see and her music from musicals made in East Germany Russia and other countries under Soviet Control It shows you that the people who made these movies and the people who watched them all look for same things a Westerner would look for which are pretty women and men singing and dancing on the streets with smiles and hopefully white teeth
1,Columbo is guest lecturer for a criminology class The students invite him along for their afterclass gettogether Transiting the nearby parking garage they discover their regular teacher next to his car dead from a gunshot wound No Columbo was not after the mans job As a class project Columbo involves the students in his sleuthing Two students tentatively identified by the viewer as culprits were in the lecture hall for the entire class Furthermore surveillance camera tapes of the parking garage show that no one other than the professor entered or left after he was last seen unexpectedly departing the lecture hall Reversing the normal routine Columbo is the one that is pestered by the evil  duo eager for progress reports and an ear for their theories Forensic evidence is almost nonexistent Solution of the case hinges on some eventual and interesting good luck On first viewing it seemed that Columbo had swallowed whole the culprits misdirection however on repeat viewing small details revealed that not to have been the case at all This reviewer has yet to tire of Columbo Goes to College
1,Hands down the best dramacomedy show on television A cleverly written show about a young mother and her 16 year old daughter exploring life and finding things out not only about the world but themselves too Lorelai Gilmore Lauren Graham struggles to find a way to remain in close bond with her daughter but steer her in the right path which throughout the show is becoming harder and harder Rory Gilmore Alexis Bledel caught in a world of books and learning is just beginning to discover boys and her own sense of rebelliousness which surprises them both With the help of Luke DanesScott Patterson and Sookie StJamesMelissa McCarthy and an enormous variety of other hilarious characters this show easily remains one of my favorites What really puts the show over the top is the complex yet incredible and witty writing often using references from pop culture to the mink dynasty

1,Double Shock is one of the many good Columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie It has all the elements we like in the Columbo episodes We get the laugh when Columbo makes something clumsy and it happens more than once in Double Shock I can almost guarantee that you will laugh several times if you decide to watch this episode We also get the riddle as usual with an almost perfect murder but something about the murder troubles Columbo The end is the usual we get the story about how Columbo solved the mystery This is another good Columboepisode and I will rate it 710 It is close to 810 Just one more question  The acting Peter Falk is very good as usual
1,One of those films that I happened across through The Criterion Collection and as usual indulged as a change of pace That turned out to be a great decision I was almost mesmerised by the quality of the film the story it told and the way it was told The almost minimalist feel to the film with sparse dialogue and almost constant music just added a whole evocative level to the film This really is a superb film to spend some time with and enjoy
1,This movie deserved better Mike Judges satirical wit brought to light something too many in this country are trying to deny were getting dumber as a society Could the 24houraday Anna Nicole coverage be any more proof Mike Judge paints a frightening future where the dumb survive and thrive Makes you stop and think and laugh Can you look at the world and not ask are we getting dumber Are we being overtaking by the human trash as well as our own trash Beware of landslides The movie is really funny Id tell you more of the plot but I dont want to spoil it So why release this film with ZERO promotion Could it be that the stupid are already taking over
1,i must say that this movie had a great cast locations music and camera work Cameron Diaz was great she had a very exciting roll very uproarish while Jordana Brewster had a serious roll yet still capturing one for me Jordanas very nostalgic she reminds of a female classmate of mine what realy got me in this movie were the very skillfully planned camera work and the choosing of the locations the story is very talently written it is a must see one the ones who are into mystery movies should watch this one i guarantee you all that itll keep you in your seats till the end
1,I knew the premise of this film and obviously I cant miss a good sounding film especially from Master of Suspense director Sir Alfred Hitchcock Basically tennis champ Guy Haines Farley Granger meets eccentric stranger Bruno Anthony Robert Walker on a train travelling from Washington to New York Bruno talks about a perfect murder Guy hates his wife and Bruno hates his father so Bruno suggests swapping murders Guy obviously didnt take him seriously until of course when Guys wife Miriam Joyce Haines Kasey Rogers or Laura Elliott is found murdered in an amusement park Guy of course is the chief suspect and Bruno keeps bumping into him reminding him of their plan and giving him more things to help him kill the father he wants dead This murder enquiry and Brunos stalking are threatening his tennis career and his relationship with the daughter of Sen Morton North by Northwests Leo G Carroll Anne Ruth Roman Bruno realises that Guy wont do his murder so he decides to plant the evidence at the crime scene to make him guilty Guys monogrammed cigarette lighter at the amusement park After his tennis game Guy and Anne who obviously found out the murder plan race to the amusement park to stop Bruno and they have a fight on the speeding outofcontrol carousel Also starring Patricia Hitchcock the directors daughter as Barbara Morton Marion Lorne as Mrs Anthony Jonathan Hale as Mr Anthony Howard St John as Police Capt Turley and John Brown as Prof Collins and Hitchcocks cameo is the Man boarding train carrying a double bass Some interesting dialogue and character interactions some good suspense moments and of course the unforgettable carousel finale a good classic film It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons the film was number 32 on 100 Years 100 Thrills Very good
1,Im glad Cage changed his name from Coppolla and got this part on his own Lighthearted no deep thought needed but a cute piece about opposites attracting though her parents are still hippies Captures the voice of the early 80s the whine of the valley and the funk of the other side One can see the beginning of Cages talent
1,Eisenstiens Potempkin Bronenosets Potyomkin is among the finest films ever made and possibly the best of the silent era Eisenstien was a pioneer of film form and his use of montage editing has influenced films to this day The Odessa Steps massacre footage is as powerful today as it was when first seen over 70 years ago DO NOT pass up the chance to see this film
1,At the end it is clear that the murderers planted the murder weapon in Mrs Columbos car and it was at the police ballistics lab  But where did the gun under the hood used in the demonstration come from Wouldnt the murderers have cleared out the stuff under the hood They had a whole week Or did Columbos cops replicate the cameragun under the hood used in the demonstration How did they do that without breaking and entering the car Perhaps this is why the murders seemed surprised at the end But how could Columbo have replicated their cameragun device and gotten it calibrated to their key fob Columbo must have gotten the gun back from ballistics and had it replanted under the hood of the car and been very lucky that the rest of the device with camera was still there and transmitting This was a 1010 show until this glaring plot error at the end
1,The movie begins almost achingly slowly a romance yawn that seems to ramble off course all part of the plan Then roughly one hour into this solemn movie is The Feast Its worth paying attention to that first hour The Feast is still solemn but humorous Suddenly the withdrawn and slightly petty characters come to life and everyone you AND the characters leave feeling enriched by the experience Women will love this Christians of all sorts will enjoy the profound faith demonstrated by the characters Not my favorite movie of all time  no dinosaurs OR laser beams after all  but definitely a movie I am happy to have seen Not to be missed Jim
1,Symbolism galore great tunes this film crushed their soon to be no more target audiences expectations These monkees and the naturally selected members of the group were witnessing a subtle yet in your face kiss goodbye to each other The message rings true today the cage you escape from and the bridge you want to jump off of are the next generations own disappointments there will always be new kids on the block replacing those who break free from the chains The film can be frustrating at times because the themes the film attacks are so blatantly apart of the American way of life a thinking and reasoning person cannot help but stare at their own reflection in the scenes of Head and question not only their personal motives for continuing the madness of everyday American life but the motives of those who want it to continue for the sake of madness The final scene similar to Don Quixotes chivalric daring of the caged tiger to exit for battle represents just how delusional and impossible most dreams are
1,I will admit I had the opportunity in the past to watch this film and after about 5  10 minutes into it I felt like many did I was expecting a Monkey movie that was similar to the television show but instead I was given well I didnt know what I was given to be honest However after finally watching this film I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts I also found myself watching it over and over again Its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as I try to attempt to decipher its meanings And just when I think Ive figured out something in the film its answer is destroyed once I watch the film again Brilliance indeed It seems that most people who disliked this film are wanting to watch a film with primarily a clear plot They want everything explained and all questions answered in the finale Well sorry if thats what youre wanting this is not the movie for you But if you liked movies like The Matrix and better yet their sequels I think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you Think of the film being like a dream In our dreams things make no sense things we expect to happen dont people places and things dont speak act or function in the same way they do in reality To complain about Head is like complaining about a dream youve had that you felt you could not understand The mind is a complex system and being that a film titled Head is just as complex is it that difficult to relate the two The music and musical numbers really stand out especially Peter Torks two compositions which remain the best tracks in the film Can You Dig It and Long Title Do I Have To Do This All Over Again This film proves that The Monkees were much more than just four zanny guys in a prefab group as their critics called them on a television show but that they are actually much more intelligent and talented than the world would give them credit for Theres so many messages that can be derived from the film both in regards to The Monkees and to the entertainment industry in general that it stands as a masterpiece of filmmaking that was far ahead of its time I feel had this film been released as an independent piece at this point and time it would actually garner the respect and admiration it deserves And one finale note One could compare this to The Beatles Magical Mystery Tour film since The Beatles film appeared to be just as strange and bizarre However in my opinion Head stands far above anything The Beatles put on celluloid
1,I first seen this movie in the early 80s and we used to have it on betamax As we all know betamax went the way of the 8trak tape sigh it really had nice picture quality too Anyways Im glad I found this movie again Ive been searching for it for more than 10 years This movie falls into the category of movies like Airplane continuous jokes oneliners funny actions bodylanguage Mark Blankfield is absolutely hilarious His transformation from the shy Dr Daniel Jekyll into the sexcrazed partyanimal Mr Hyde is unforgettable complete with goldtooth chesthair and goldchains The part I loved best was when he hijacked the car from this poor guy and then drove to Madam Woo Woos Totally psychedelic experience without the drugs If you need laugh therapy this is the movie to do it When I first seen it I had tears in my eyes and my belly was hurting from constantly laughing This is a movie I could watch over and over again I highly recommend it
1,Bit of a curates egg this one I started off hating it with its predictable Old Dark House setup its constant references to recent US horrors and regular trips up and down dimly lit corridors But it does get going and has its moments of originality I began to wonder  once the killing started how they were going to last out with only a cast of six but then we get flashbacks to a previous visit to the building and see a whole slew of gory killings which is pretty effective Naschy is fine and by the end its been an enjoyable enough movie It just does not jump up and grab one hard enough
1,In an early scene Luca David Pasquesi and James Jeff Garlin are walking down a neighborhood street in Chicago admiring the bucolic architecture when a woman angrily arguing in French on a cell phone passes by them prompting James to remark Theres nothing hotter than an angry French woman A few blocks later they pass an old Filipino woman also angry also arguing on a cell phone and Luca remarks for referential effect Theres nothing hotter than an angry elderly Filipino woman The humor in Jeff Garlins I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With is best characterized by the word quotidian The film is a conversation We might as well be eavesdropping Rather than go for antics the film relies on character flaws and human curiosity to deliver laughs While its not innovative it is far from banal and even if James views himself as being rather jejune we know that he is fairly average and this endears him Selfbetterment is the primary theme of the movie Sarah Silverman who plays Beth is excellent as the catalyst of change she revitalizes James and so reminds him to live a better life Even so achieving some idyllic dream is not the end of these characters but rather something simpler that they might pick up what pieces there are of the life they love just to keep for themselves at least enough to carry on A movie about life lessons can be overwrought as it can forget to connect with its audience I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With is subtle and winsome and while its moral may not be inspiring it is still resonant This is lowkey comedy but it will stick with you
1,As an ex Merchant Seaman I was really interested in this movie  I personally have been involved in a stowaway search on leaving Kingston Jamaica where one person was found We managed to get him ashore though as we were in territorial limits On another ship I was on the stowaway was found and we could not land him anywhere due to passportnationality issues In fact he stayed on for a year as an almost honorary crew member and worked for his keep Africa is notorious for stowaway pickups There is a great scene in the beginning of the film when the bulk carrier enters the African port  her size dwarfing all The crew pop ashore for a little intercourse and inebriation So far normal The drama starts when the stowaways enter the vast cavernous holds of the ship Joss Ackland is brilliant as the Captain with a drink problem being harassed by his Nemesis Suchet right on form as the Companys representative on board The stowaway search is classic but we did not have guns I question the use of guns in this film This ship seemed to have a vast armoury In my experience guns at sea are severely restricted due to customs regulations also having a dog on board was oddAnti Rabies laws especially in Europe restrict carrying of animal severely Anyway Pertwee is brilliant as the embittered Mate The horror which follows the discovery of the victims is unbearable  the grim metallic background of the ships holds and a feeling that there is no where to hide adds to the dramaSome of the freighters crew are not into the murder and those who get involved are gradually sucked in to a world of violence from which there is no escapeThe chase through the ship especially the engine room scenes are edge on the seat  the feeling of extreme claustrophobia abounds The feeling of metal pressing in and death being only a gun barrel away The film is brutal  my girlfriend had to give up watching it during the shooting and beating scenes While this goes on Suchet in the comfort of his well appointed cabin gets drunk unaware of the mayhem 3 decks below Its a tense film flawed in parts but the real message is that we can all get sucked into violence like this Slowly and surely Think of the train drivers who took Jews to Auschwitz the clerks who worked out those train timetable I always remember someone who had visited Dachau concentration camp at the end of the war and he said that one of the SS Guards had put a birdtable outside the camp crematorium This film is like that  ordinary people suddenly finding themselves in a world of unstoppable violence
1,Ive watched many short films in my day Often I find them either too compressed throwing too much information at the viewer in the short amount of time they have to run too artsy or lacking a clearcut vision I can say none of these things about Starcrossed In this review Ill do my best to avoid any dramatic spoilers but Ill also assume that the reader understands that the theme of this film is brotherly incest As with any short film the story is fairly simple straightforward and easy to digest Its clear that the film attempts to shine a light one one of modern societys most deeply held taboos This film succeeds in every respect In the fifteen minutes of running time I found myself feeling a gamut of emotions With only a little dialog the viewer is rapidly pulled into the most personal moments and thoughts of these starcrossed brothers From the opening scene set in their early childhood one can see the very close relationship the brothers have When the film progresses to the present day in the next scene the excellent acting and honest heartfelt performances remind the viewer that love can come in the most unexpected and harsh way As the relationship progresses any disgust the viewer may initially feel is quickly replaced by sympathy and emotional distress as the viewer suddenly realizes that there can be only one possible resolution And the aftermath of that resolution is heartrending Anyone with an open mind would do well to watch this film and absorb its message If nothing else it boldly and honestly challenges the viewer to reexamine some of our deepest beliefs on the shamefilled and secretive taboo of incest Though the film is only fifteen minutes long it resonates in the viewer long after the credits roll This is perhaps my favorite short film Ive ever seen I cant recommend it highly enough
1,It could not have come from a different country nor from a different time This movie simply oozes psychedelia influenced late 60s Italian cinema So pseudo serious and sexually free Sumptuous settings and dreamy music make this a visual and aural delight Plus we get the lovely Dagmar Lassander surely at her very best looking The kinky goings on make for a wild ride and if the romps amidst the Mimosa towards the end seem overlong it is but another rather charming trait of the time You were probably expected to split those few minutes between the screen and your girlfriend and it does of course herald a twist in the proceedings It might have been better if Philippe Leroy didnt look quite so odd with his fraying red hair and twisted facial expression He does well though and has many silent moments where Dagmar is cavorting and he has to show a mixture of love and hate Not an ordinary narrative film by any means but for those who like that something different this is certainly that
1,This is a perfectly watchable adventurous movie to watch with a great cast and a good story based on true events Its interesting to note that the story of the movie is based on true events Its above all for most part an adventurous story with all of the usual ingredients you would expect from an adventurous movies set in an Arabic world So lots of sword fighting good old fashioned honor religion and a rich proud country But the movie is also filled with humor to make the movie a light and pleasant one to watch The constant cutting back and forth between the Morocco plot involving Sean Connery and Candice Berger and the American plot line involving Theodore Roosevelt Brian Keith wasnt the best possible approach in my opinion The two things have totally different paces totally different characters it are just totally different worlds Of course both story lines are connected and focuses on the same thing but the contrast between the two worlds is just too big to let it work out It doesnt at all times make the movie feel connected and a bit disjointed The American plot line is most of the time more political while the Morrocan plot line is purely adventurous and action filled In the end you could perhaps even wonder what the whole point or Roosevelt in this movie was Seem that John Milius is just a big admirer of him Often the American plot line would take away most of the pace out of the far more interesting and more action filled fast paced Morrocan plot line After all John Milius always has been at his best as an action director It isnt until halve way through that the movie fully gets on steam The most and largest scaled action of the movie then kicks in Especially the large scale end battle does not disappoint I wish the entire movie was like this That way this movie would had also been a better known one no doubt The movie has a great Jerry Goldsmith musical score that is perhaps way better known than the actual movie itself The movie is also a good looking one with great production design and nice looking action and battle sequences in it Appereantly the movie only costs 4000000 to make but that is really hard to believe considering the settings and size of the movie I mean John Milius his best known movie Conan the Barbarian cost about 20000000 to make but was a far more campy looking one and was less impressive on its scale Quite funny to see an Arabic speak with a big fat Scottish accent but hey its Sean Connery so you just simply tend to accept this He suits his role well So does Candice Bergen Its always hard for a female character to come across as believable and work out in a movie such as this one but she manages Also John Huston plays a great role in this movie A perfectly fine watchable movie 710
1,The Happiest Days of Your Life showcases some of Britains greatest comedy talents of its time in a traditionally farcical and upperclasstwit like fashion Generally it is a whistlestop tour of stuffy English behaviour with the girlsonly school providing a great setting for the dotty goingson Margaret Rutherford Alastair Sim and  most especially  Joyce Grenfell are all fantastic giving us a lot of laughs as they express their utter horror at what they are having to deal with As the film moves on things get sillier and sillier with the tour around the school for the parents being a suitably crackers high point At this point I will give special mention again to Joyce Grenfell and her wonderful character Miss Gossage She is so extraordinarily innocent silly apologetic and ineffectual that she seems to steal the whole film She provides the greatest laugh of the film when she flirts with a male teacher Call me sausage Whilst some of the film is slow or dated and not always very involving it still maintains most of its sparkle and barely pauses for romance Good for a silly harmless giggle 710
1,Perhaps the best movie ever made by director Kevin Tenney well his Witchboard is not on the top of my alltime horror list this one is a strange fascinating mixture between Pin and Childs Play both better than this one but not so better Sure the plot is contrived and perhaps too predictable but the actors are good Rosalind Allen is very pleasant to the eye and so is Candance McKenzie  God bless her for the shower scene the child actress is very good in interpreting the disturbed daughter and the Pinocchio puppet is scary enough to give you a few thrills down the spine For a Bmovie not bad at all
1,A great performance by Emily Grace I stumbled upon this movie while browsing my satellite listings and was curious by the summary of the plot giving by my satellite service provider I was high entertained and had much compassion for the character Alice played by Emily Grace The story had me guessing in what would happen to Alice and was not predicable The overall story was refreshing and had some great twists to the supporting characters The ending of the story ended on a rather fair way I will purchase this DVD to add to my library I am a new fan of Emily Grace and I high anticipate in seeing more from her performances
1,David Lynch shot his first film Erasurehead over several years adding new scenes each time he managed to raise a little bit more cash Kevin Smith made Clerks at work while working as a clerk and Robert Rodriguez has boasted that From Dusk Till Dawn cost precisely 30000 But 30000 is still a hell of a lot of money to raise if you work as a cleaner in a cemetery And what if an aspiring film maker not only had such a job but also had all the ambition of such luminaries and all the dorkishness of Smith but absolutely none of the talent Such a figure is Mark Borchardt the subject of this hilarious documentary which chronicles his attempt to make a pair of movies over many many years Borchardt combines his lunatic dreams with flights of depression and a fatal inability to call it a day one senses he almost prefers the endless labours of searching for an impossible perfection to an accommodation with the reality that hes simply on the evidence presented in American Movie not very good And like a modern day Ed Wood he surrounds himself with an epic crowd of fellow losers his genuine affection for whom is his greatest redeeming feature The collection includes his warring parents his best friends one a criminal the other a reformed drug addict his own hapless children and best of all his aged Uncle Bill Bill may live in a trailer park and just about have given up on life but he is the owner of a small fortune 280000 to be precise and the touching but potentially exploitative relationship between the two men lies at the heart of the film Borchardt manages to enlist a few actors to perform alongside himself of course but in the main he is wholly dependent on friends and family to complete his work even Bill has a role on camera On British TV the BBC brilliantly scheduled a screening of American Movie backtoback with Lost in La Mancha the story of Terry Gilliams ill fated attempt to film Don Quixote In that film one was impressed by the huge amount of professionalism on display inadequate as it was to the task in hand and just how damn difficult it is even for experts with millions to spend to make a film whereas Borschadt is not only penniless but also such a clown that he cant even pronounce the name of his own work Coven properly Ultimately Borschadt is human enough for you to want him to succeed but awful enough for the viewer to still be able to laugh at his failures If this film was fiction youd dismiss it as unbelievable but as it is its one of the funniest documentaries youre likely to see
1,Twins Effect starring some of HKs most popular stars provides one of the most enjoyable film experiences to come out of HK in sometime It has something for everyone action comedy horror romance and some drama This film cant be taken too seriously otherwise youd go in dissapointed but if you leave your brain at the door and just watch the film for some fun youre bound to enjoy it Great special effects excellent action cute Twins cool HK actors FUN film Id recommend it to anyone
1,First of all I believe that this movie is much more appreciated by viewers who have actually read Joseph Conrads Heart Of Darkness the book that was the literary basis for the movie With that said I believe that this movie is astounding It is an excellent war film that doesnt so much concentrate on the gore and brutality of the Vietnam Conflict but more the psychological toll that it took on the young inexperienced kids who were sent to fight it Coppola showed real genius in the art of filmmaking using many visuals to help tell the story The acting I felt was definitely allaround up to par Marlon Brandos part in the movie is what really got me as far as acting His elucidation to Willard at the end of the film reels you in and reveals the hollowness of a man that youve heard about and wanted to see throughout the movie Those who would consider this just another war movie need to give a detailed look to all the literary elements that are entwined with this film because there is a great amount of meaning behind it all In my opinion this is one of the most sculptured and bestmade films of all time
1,Hoot is a nice young persons film about a group of middle school kids that try and keep a pancake house chain from bulldozing a plot of land that is home to some endangered burrowing owls The acting is pretty good and the fresh faces are nice to see Many well known comedians are in this film and keep the humor going almost nonstop It is a film for the young crowd perhaps 5 to 11 years of age I thought it was a nice change of pace from the adult films that pervade the screen these days There is no realism here or accuracy about life in general for adults or kids Its just a bunch of fun with a constant message about saving the beautiful places in this country from becoming over developed If you can remember back to the day when you werent fight for a buck you may remember that money isnt everything Not many people over 12 are going to enjoy it unless they really have a soft spot for the old after school special series
1,Add this little gem to your list of holiday regulars It is sweet funny and endearing
1,In these days of ultrafast processors and the Internet coming up with a movie like The Matrix may seem merely the next step from coining the term cyberspace but do you remember what computers were like in 1974 Right To come up with the notion of virtual reality back then is truly an amazing feat of the imagination Fassbinders movie of course has none of the massive gunslinging and pyrotechnics and a lot of artsy elements instead but the atmosphere it creates is intense and poses the question how we can know what is real in a dark and gripping manner making this a chiller and a thriller for the mind It also takes it up a notch on more recent VR stories if you get out of one cyberspace can you be sure you didnt just emerge into another level of virtual reality
1,This film was one of three that were later combined by Chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters in the late 1950s under the title The Chaplin Review This was an odd film in some ways because later in life Chaplin was antiwar and his movies stressed peace and brotherhood This film in contrast is a propaganda comedy meant to bolster the US efforts in WWI Its truly odd to see Charlie as the super soldier who singlehandedly captures 13 Germans casually and coolly shoots several Germans in mere seconds as a marksman and then goes behind enemy lines to try to capture the Kaiser himself Truly this was a major departure for the Little Tramp though it was at the same time very very entertaining and funny The film is exceptionally wellpaced well made and Im sure did a lot to bolster support at home for our troops too bad it was such a pointless and costly war
1,We have a character named Evie Evie just wants to be a good person Shes nice friendly smiles often but is strangely brutally honest Evie also has a secret Her idiotsavant sister has been reciting original poetry which is getting the community excited about the sister writing Unfortunately its Evies poetry While their mother starts being happy again and the boy next door shows his interest in Evie Evie just tries to figure out what she really wants to do What to keep in mind while watching this movie is who Evie really is For such a brutally honest person who doesnt mind telling Ivyleague types that she doesnt respect them it would seem odd that she would be able to pull off a lie For someone so happy and cheerful shes quite emotionless when it comes to certain issues Those arent character flaws theyre plot development and they mean a lot more than they at first seem Mostly this is something of a melodrama a character lies the other characters personalities propel them through drama as relationships are held at risk But in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold The acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch The directing and the cinematography arent quite as good Theyre acceptable and Evies world is wreathed in color and light which makes for some very beautiful images but its not very consistent Its not really so much of a flaw as a result of a low production value but within that same value is some genuine storytelling and a real care for the characters So while it isnt a perfect movie its certainly an enjoyable one PolarisDiB
1,Jimmy Stewart was a real life pilot WWII flier and a onestar general in the Air Force and therefore a natural for how real pilots react when they fly When you see the faithful recreation of the actual plane you begin to understand the reallife bravery and courage of Lucky Lindy when he flew the Atlantic solo in 1927
1,SPOILERS AHEAD Great WrestleManias were still a few years away But this one was certainly good with lots of good matches and one great match Demolition was always at their best at WrestleMania Im glad their last WM hoorah I refuse to include the other version was a win over the Colossal Connection I liked the gag of Andre never tagging in Few fans know that this was the first time anyone ever beat Mr Perfect For some reason Brutus Beefcakes feat was never recognized Or the fact that he did it pretty easily The Hart Foundations win over the Bolsheviks was the shortest in WM history including the 249 second match between King Kong Bundy and SD Jones Im glad Jake and DiBiase got to fight at WrestleMania This made up for the fact that the feud had to be put on hold for so long I expected the Big BossmanAkeem feud to heat up but the Bossman just clobbered him As good as Bossman was as a heel he was just great as a face He was always intense and obviously loved his job If the Warrior just had a better work ethic and maybe tried to learn to wrestle he would have been a great WWF champion Worth a watch especially since the boring matches are too short to complain about And the tag team matches are all very exciting
1,I was blown away when I saw The Best Years of Our Lives The acting script and Master William Wylers Directionwinner of Best Director in 1946is Brilliant This film is about three WWII veterans who come home from the war and are reunited with their loved ones but have to deal with the hardships of coming home from the war The first man Al StephensonPlayed by Fredric March in his Oscar winning role comes home to find his wife Millieplayed by Myrna Loy and children Peggy and Robplayed by Teresa Wright and Michael Hall are more grown up and different than before he left for the war The second man Fred Derryplayed by Dana Andrews has to find a good job and come home to a wife he had only been married to 20 days before he left for the war He begins to find out that she is not the same Homer Parishplayed by Harold Russell in his Oscar winning rolehas lost his hands in the war and must deal with his familys and fiance Wilmasplayed by Cathy ODonnell reactions to the hooks he has instead of his hands All of these men and their families are reunited in the film in different scenes The stories of these men are all interwoven beautifully together This film truly defines the meaning of a Classic This unforgettable dramawinner of best picture in 1946 is a film that everyone should see If I was asked to pick a favorite film this would be it Out of 10 I would give The Best Years of Our Lives An 10 So next time you go to your local video store rent this movie you wont regret it NO objectionable material a good family film
1,From the start you will like Sam Elliotts character Falon  a trustworthy cop that is notably loyal to his partner But too loyal and too revengeful when seeing his partner dead in an alley cause he then kills who he thought to be the assailant before giving him a chance to explain Falon is an alcoholic and that tends to sway him from being in self control though he manages to direct his attention towards finding whos really behind his partners death He carries along a rookie as his new partner which seems to be seen too often in films but Esai Morales does well in accompanying Sam Elliot though puzzling pieces begin to fit to where Morales begins a selfapproved investigation towards Falon he mainly wants to find the answers since Fallon isnt letting him in on the whole story and does not like what he finds There is not a last minute showing at who the bad detectives are which is okay and they are not able to sway Falon into joining them leading to a dramatic ending Fine acting all the way around with a touch of humor from Paul Sorvino who is the captain of detectives Its a good movie that will make you want to see it several times so it qualifies as a must see and a good addition to a movie collection Filmed in San Francisco
1,A serial killer  Carl Stargher  has been kidnapping and murdering young women by letting them drown in a water filled cell  He is apprehended by the FBI  but is in a coma and his latest kidnap victim awaits in a cell timed to fill with water  Take a look at the above premise and youll see that theres a very much seen it all before look to it  The magic of Mark Protosevichs script is that he changes a hoary old chestnut plot in to something quite different from what youre expecting  If I mentioned the plot involves a machine that allows a psychiatrist to enter the mind of Stargher then sets up a different film entirely  This wouldnt be enough to make THE CELL a different class of thriller but director Tarsem Singh creates a visually striking surreal thriller  The cinematography by Paul Laufer where opaque primary colours are to the fore is stunning but Singh doesnt let it end there  things like costume design where Stargher wanders around his idiosyncratic universe wearing opulent costumes does have a visual impact making this so much more than a run of a mill thriller  What stops THE CELL becoming a classic movie however is that you start becoming more and more aware that the whole movie revolves around the visuals rather than having a natural narrative  We see a third character  a FBI man enter Starghers domain but this seems more like a contrived plot turn just to introduce the audience to more stunning but very disturbing moments It should also be pointed out that this is a rather disturbing thriller with a atmosphere that is very depressing and that stops the film from being if not enjoyable  then involving  One scene where a FBI agent recounts a case where a paedophile beats a rap only to later cut out the heart of his victim will fill your heart with so much despair you might reach for the off button  Youll probably have to watch a massive amount of thrillers till you see another one as disconcerting as this one
1,Thirty years prior to THE DEER HUNTER came this movie an excellent meditation on the effects of war inflicted on the American family as seen from both the war heroes and their wives A truly ironic title THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES is anything but since those times have vanished into still images and all that is left is an uncertain future for those involved Truly an ensemble cast despite the topbilling of Myrna Loy THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES focuses more on the stories of the men Al Stephenson Fredric March comes back to a household that has irrevocably changed as his sons have grown although he finds support from his doting wife Milly Myrna Loy Fred Derry upon returning cannot find a decent job despite being a war veteran and is trapped in a marriage that he does not want to Marie a happygolucky girl who wants more out of life and who increasingly comes to hate him Homer Parrish on the other hand has greater problems due to his loss of hands at war and feels the entire world  including the girl he loves and her family  thinks he is a freak of nature At almost three hours of length the film never seems long and drawn out There is so much emotions happening even in small moments that the plot breezes by nothing seems wasted or placed on screen due to a lack of editing Not a performance rings false though the standouts are those of Dana Andrews as Fred Derry Harold Russell as Homer Parrish and Virginia Mayo as Marie Derry Even then every character has his or her moment on film and the time was right to talk about all the pain and suffering that until then had not been seen in American films including the ones made around World War One which did not dabble in such topics While there is never any overt violence its all there in the haunted expressions of the three male leads faces in the lot where the planes now reside ready to be turned into junk and therefore forgetfulness in the cynicism of the store owners who couldnt be bothered to employ these shellshocked men who had seen battle or even worse to goad them into wondering what was it all worth for This is the film in which COMING HOME and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY are indebted to At a time when America fled from war films to come up with this when the end of the Second World War was still fresh was a necessity in order to make a more honest filmmaking

1,Im out of words to describe the beauty of The Cranes are Flying but Ill try anyway to write about it Its a powerful and delicate love story that takes its place in the Second World War Its the classic story of lovers Boris  Veronika separated by the war and of what comes between them The films images are so gorgeous that youll be carried away  the film technique is in perfect unison with the emotion There are few scenes that portray directly the war A bombing  wind lightnings explosions  that will have important consequences in the life of the main protagonist Veronika who waits for the return of Boris and theres another scene on the front where we we will be confronted by a emotionalvisual hurricane showing the images played in Boris mind Another scene works as the leitmotif of the film and provides its title  the cranes flying in the sky This image stands as a the symbol for Nature and its seasons and underlines the final message of the film Not to give up hope and fight for a better future Kalatozov is a great director this film is visually stunning and it also touched me deeply It is not just pure technique  Tatyana Samojlova is perfect as Veronika What more can I say The film transcends the time it was made  the action takes place during the Second World War But it could have happened anytime anywhere As long there are wars great or small the film and its message will remain relevant
1,Down Periscope is not a Great Movie But then again very few flicks are So if your looking for entertainment instead of great wisdom this is a great movie without the capitals No sharp sexism or graphic violence spoil this light comedy about a bunch of misfits who are assigned to a antique submarine They are set to fail their tasks so that a general can get his extra star They must take on the entire USnavy with its nuclear submarines But they are underdogs and this is a comedy so you can guess the outcome But you root for those underdogs and this makes it a very entertaining movie Watch and enjoy  eight stars that is
1,Im not a massive Disney fan but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them so weve built up quite a collection and this is one of my favourites We first saw this a couple of weeks ago and we must have see it half a dozen times since OK as others have pointed out not the most complex or inventive of plots but theres more to a film than that Great characters Phil Harris stealing the show as Thomas OMalley but Edgar the butler not far behind The music is superb  my disabled son always insists that I lift him up and dance with him to Everybody wants to be Cat this says it all And Thomas OMalley is just as enjoyable Im not sure why some people have such a downer on this film other than a dislike of cats And yes it does take a few of its cues from 101 Dalmations and maybe The Lady and the Tramp Its been a long time since Ive seen that so Im not going to compare them and while 101 Dalmations is better in some ways for me The Aristocats is far more enjoyable Isnt that what these films are about  Apart from Peter Pan now that is a 1010 film this is my favourite Disney film My 7 yearold son loves it his grumpy 41 year old dad loves it so you cant ask much more of a family film Superb
1,Closet Land The title itself conjures up thoughts of secrets And that is really whats at the heart of this Amnesty International film Government secrets personal secrets both are integral pieces of this story By far the greatest acting seen in too long a time both Alan Rickman and Madeleine Stowe were phenomenal in their portrayal of a Government Interrogator and Victim respectively With only the two actors in this unusual standard length film it is instantly clear that both actors were dedicated and talented enough to pull the viewer into this tiny bubble of a world and shut the door A WORD OF CAUTION What isnt mentioned on the description of this movie is that there is a subplot that deals with childhood sexual abuse While there is no graphic detail about the abuse the nature of it may be difficult for some viewers to watch  especially given the intensity of the film on whole Im not a big fan of Amnesty International films but this movie drew me in because the acting was so exceptional and I cant help but make this movie one of my personal favorites
1,Believe it or not the Mona Lisa actually got stolen once and was missing for nearly two years In 1911 Leonardo da Vincis La Gioconda better known as the Mona Lisa was taken from the Louvre by a petty thief and former Louvre employee who allegedly sought to return the worlds most famous piece of art to its native Italy His actions after the theft make it seem more likely that he intended to sell the painting for his personal profit Of course he had no hope of finding a buyer The Mona Lisa was quietly returned to the Louvre on the very last day of 1913 remaining there ever since except for occasional loanouts When Arsène Lupin was released in 1932 twenty years after the theft most moviegoers would have recalled that 1911 crime and their knowledge would have lent some plausibility to this movie Arsène Lupin is quite enjoyable with MGMs usual high production standards and Jack Conways usual briskly efficient direction This movie does not lack for pleasure what it lacks is plausibility John Barrymore is the master criminal of the title he specialises in perpetrating impossible crimes which he makes even more difficult by announcing them in advance  but of course he always commits the crime and fools the gendarmes Tully Marshall has a good scene as one of Barrymores victims Lupin has a penchant for elaborate disguises which enables Barrymore a US Grade A ham to indulge his own penchant for tomfoolery Johns older brother Lionel Barrymore is Guerchard the Javertlike Surete detective sworn to catch Lupin Karen Morley was an extremely beautiful actress whose private life was filled with populist political activities on screen she was most impressive in workingclass roles that fitted her own political beliefs such as her fine performance in Our Daily Bread In Arséne Lupin Morleys naturally dark hair is bleached a horrid blonde tone and shes all tarted up in posh outfits that make her look uncomfortable rather than sexy SPOILERS COMING Eventually Lupin decides to steal the Mona Lisa from the Louvre He slits the painting from its frame rolls up the canvas and then smuggles it out in a flower basket We see John Barrymore casually brandishing a tightlyrolled piece of cloth which is allegedly the greatest work of art in all human history I had to laugh at the filmmakers error In real life but not in this movie da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa on a plank of poplar wood so a thief would have difficulty rolling it up Eventually Guerchard captures Lupin and hauls him off to Le Calaboose The scene between John and Lionel Barrymore in the police car is sheer delight as their genuine affection for each other spills out into their characters dialogue I would have found this scene implausible with any two other actors As it is I cant imagine anyone but the Barrymore brothers playing these roles Well maybe Dennis and Randy Quaid but just barely Dont look for a good plot line here but Arsène Lupin is a delightful example of oldstyle moviemaking Ill rate this movie 8 points out of 10
1,I just finished watching this last weekend and found it absolutely hillarious some of the scenes I just couldnt stop laughing at Dennis is soooo amazingly thick sometimes and just says the stoopidest thingsbut at the same time hes just being cool to impress his girlfriend who gets arrested anyway The beach scenery is very tranquiluntil along comes Robbie Coltrane Not the greatest movie ever made but certainly something to think about renting on a Saturday night when you havent got much else to do like I did You might need to hunt around for it though  I was lucky as my local video store stocks it
1,I lack cablevision and no longer have DirecTV So being a rural resident I have to wait for DVD releases Being a lover of blondes but not blonds I of course not only have Barb Wire but I have Stripperella The Complete First Season Ive not yet found VIP or a second season for Stripperella I have the Baywatch Hawaiian Wedding DVD I have the issues of Playboy that Pamela Denise Anderson posed in I could go on I love Pamela There is no one or anything that could make me feel guilty about enjoying Stripperella But there are certain elements that I dislike but live with for other series depict smoking and alcohol consumption too some times But those are my personal peeves and I try not to let them ruin the fun of a series like this for me I too was taken aback by the change in animation style but I adapted However the amount of female nudity decreased and that is a big disappointment as one expects a lot of it in a series with a premise like this But then again I adapted One of my favorite episodes of Mork  Mindy was when they got to meet Robin Williams So of course one of my favorite episodes of Striperella is when Pamela  Tommy visit the club and the comparisons begin If there really is a Season 2 I hope that I can find it for as a completest I need to complete my collection I recommend this for other admirers of the female form and lovers of blondes Hey Psst Blonde  blondes are the feminine form for spelling blond Your software should already know that
1,Almost four years after the Iraq war started and were in a bigger hole than ever Thats right so all those flag wavers who were so sure of the right and might of the American way are now chasing their tails isnt that true You bet it is This movie said so from the beginning It is kind of freaky how much the filmor should I say filmmaker knew what was coming It is almost like going to a fortune teller and hearing what was going to happen in the future There was a point when I felt the hairs standing up on the back of my neck as GW announced that major combat operations are over on top of a visual of a broken down RV being towed away with the American flag waving in the rearview mirror You have to see it to understand what I mean But even if you are apolitical or even if you are prowar this movie will have some kind of impact on you because it is so embedded in history
1,Midnight Madness is a movie that is unfortunately highly underrated and unappreciated With a flood of classic edgy teencollege movies this one was forgotten As a child I would watch this movie over and over again luckily I had it on video This movie shows a more tame but most exciting side of the eighties In the cynical society we live in this day and age with drug abuse being the coolest thing its good to see once in awhile a fun innocent movie that is Midnight Madnessthat is if you can find it
1,Treading Water is a very beautiful movie I would put it straight under the wonderful short movie  Cosa bella from Fiona MacKenzie Its not only about coming out but also about tolerance and acceptance in general I am looking forward to seeing more of Laurel Himmels work in the future The actors Angie Redman and Nina Landey are quite good The main characters relationship could have been strenghtened a bit as we understand there is a very strong bond between them but maybe this could have been explained a bit I am surprised that Angie Redman doesnt appear much in other movies A great first step as a director for Laurel Himmel I am sure theres more to see from her skills
1,I saw this movie on my local cable system under the title of Beyond Redemption I was searching for new material to watch since most of the reruns one Saturday morning didnt interest me Ive always been a fan of Andrew McCarthy and Michael Ironside so I chose this movie I was pleasantly surprised Personally I enjoyed the film Rich Roesing who posted a comment about the film being spoiled for him by seeing scenes from the movie on the back of a video rental box are well justified I did not have the disappointment of knowing beforehand anything about the film This led me to rate the movie higher than the average score listed on the page I like suspense movies and this one was no exception The movie kept me guessing until the very end I was surprised by the ending The moments of reflection and remembrance of past experiences by the main character during the film only added to the suspense His reactions to those remembrances gave the film a sense of the humanitarian yet conflictual side of police work The struggle with his faith is also a welcome addition If you like suspense films but also like films that expound on the characters feeling personal inflection side this film is for you Should you find this movie on your local cable or satellite systems guide watch it However if you are looking for a rental video follow Rich Roesings advice and have someone get the video for you before watching it
1,I saw FAREWELL TO HARRY at the Plaza Theatre while in New York city and was quite taken The performance of William Hall Jr is tremendous This is a movie for the classic movie goer Garrett Bennetts direction reminds me of early Barry Levinson and Robert Redfords work The movie seems to transcend the typical independent film It has a soul and a visual power that is quite unique I saw this with a small audience 400 who were captivated from the moment of the first credit to the last and although I wasnt out and out crying like the lady next to me I do have to admit I had a little watering in the eyes 
1,If vampire tales are your cup of blood then this Gothfest based on the Anne Rice Vampire Chronicles should prove to be a satisfying experience A veritable consortium of the undead in a contemporary setting Queen of the Damned directed by Michael Rymer is a story of shadows and darkness and of the unfortunate souls who dwell therein for eternity 	The vampire Lestat Stuart Townsend bored with a world that no longer excites him has been asleep for many years but suddenly the sounds of that world he hears from his extended slumber change and liking what he hears he ventures forth to investigate What he finds is a world filled with new sounds a new kind of music driving and penetrating sounds that assault the senses and make him feel alive and welcome And he knows that at long last his time has come that it is time for him and those like him to come out into the open and face the world on their terms Toward that end he becomes the front man for a band a singer and performer unlike any the world has ever known He presents himself as a vampire and very quickly amasses a following that extends far beyond London where it all begins and will ultimately take him to Death Valley California where he plans to give a concert that promises to be beyond anything anyone has ever seen or experienced 	Lestat is powerful without question but there are those of his kind who do not take favorably to the fact that he has revealed them one of whom is Marius Vincent Perez a vampire powerful in his own right the vampire in fact who made Lestat so many years before and they are gathering coming together and making their plans to meet Lestat at the concert And they are not going for the music But there is something else as well At one point Lestat has inadvertently awakened the Mother of them all the most powerful of all the vampires Akasha Aaliyah who is about to make her presence known to all and especially to the one she has chosen to rule by her side as her King Lestat And at the concert rest assured Akasha will be in attendance without fail 	Make no mistake this is Lestats story and Rymer presents it amid a setting rich with atmosphere and with some exquisite moments though his film has less bite to it than say Interview With the Vampire or Bram Stokers Dracula He sets a good pace and there are some scenes that provide some real thrills but overall the film isnt as soaked in menace as it could be or as much as one might expect In the final tally in fact the amount of flesh that is incinerated wins out over actual bloodletting though there is more than a taste of gore and more than a fair share of lips and mouths dripping with the red stuff Theres some good FX on hand too especially in the sequences that accentuate the speed of the vampires as they move and hurtle through the air faster than the naked eye can discern Its a decent job by Rymer but he could have put more teeth into it had he played up the alienation hinted at by Lestat as it is you get a sense of his detachment but not enough to get you totally involved 	In Interview With the Vampire Tom Cruise brought some charismatic star power to the role of Lestat but Townsend is even more effective with a look and an attitude that captures Lestat perfectly He plays him with a sense of acceptance and under closer scrutiny you may even find a hint of remorse and longing Its a good performance and one that sells his character convincingly 	As Marius Vincent Perez does a nice job too he is in fact one of the strengths of the film though his character is a bit ambiguous that however has more to do with the way he was written than with Perezs performance which is quite good  	Turning in noteworthy performances as well are Marguerite Moreau as Jesse a young woman too curious for her own good and the gorgeous Lena Olin as Maharet Jesses Aunt who ultimately plays a pivotal role in the outcome of the drama involving Lestat and Akasha 	And as Akasha Aaliyah is an absolutely riveting presence What more can one say about her other than she is a gifted performer with tremendous talent and beauty And tragically she has left us much too soon 	The supporting cast includes Paul McGann David Christian Manon Mael Claudia Black Pandora Bruce Spence Khayman Matthew Newton Armand Tiriel Mora Roger and Megan Dorman Maudy With a much stronger story than the usual offerings of this particular genre Anne Rice fans especially will be pleased with Queen of the Damned a film nicely crafted and delivered by director Rymer and his engaging cast By focusing attention on the drama of the story and the way its presented rather than concentrating on merely providing some cheap thrills Rymer has succeeded in turning out a true horror film that is definitely a cut above and one that just may whet your appetite for more of the same And thats the magic of the movies I rate this one 710      
1,On March 17 1974 a man is found dead in the toilets at Manhattans Penn Station Although wellknown he cannot be identified because he scratched out the personal information in his passport and his body lays unclaimed at the citys morgue for three days It turned out to be the body of what many consider one of the greatest American architects of the twentieth century Louis I Kahn He died at the age of 73 on his way from India where one of his greatest projects the Institute for Management in Ahmedabad was nearing completion One of the most influential postwar American architects Louis Kahns architectural legacy includes the house of parliament in Dhaka Bangladesh the Kimbell Art Museum in Forth Worth the Yale Art Gallery the Salk Institute in California and a kind of mobile music boat designed to give concerts in harbours in various cities around the world While celebrated as an architect very little was known about his private life In addition to his wife Esther and their daughter Sue Ann Kahn was survived by two mistresses Harriet Pattison and Anne Tyng and their two children All three families lived within miles of each other in suburban Philadelphia but their paths never crossed until the funeral His son Nathaniel the director of this film was only 11 years old at the time and had only a few memories of his fathers weekly visits at Harriet Patterson Nathaniels mother in Philadelphia Twentyfive years later he sets out on a journey to confront his father by visiting Kahns buildings talking to relatives and colleagues and visiting the places that played a role in Louis Kahns life One of the most moving confrontations is when Nathaniel asks his mother a landscape architect and mistress of Louis Kahn why she kept up with playing second fiddle to his wife and never confronted him with this Tears shed her eyes but she has no regrets It was worth it Its such an intensely sad moment Shes obviously shattered treated as an outcast at his funeral which she was forbidden to attend its almost as if she led a substitute life It all feels strangely unreal Another interview with Edward Bacon Kahns architectural nemesis who was in charge of the rebuilding of his native Philadelpia in the fifties and sixties almost suffers a stroke on the spot when he is reminded of Kahns unsavoury ideas about architecture His son Nathaniel listens uncomfortably when a very senior Bacon literally screams with anger whenever Kahns name comes up The final scene is reserved for Kahns grandest creation the Capitol in Dhaka Bangladesh It took 23 years to complete a vast and extraordinary building of which the Bangladeshi are extremely proud Its one of the very few national symbols with stature in this impoverished nation Some of the interviews with the locals brought tears in my eyes especially when they find out they are talking to  God forbid  the architects own son The film is as much a personal journey as it is an account of Kahns grand architectural legacy and is above all about the fruition of the film itself and filmmaking in general Perhaps Louis I Kahn faltered as a father but these shortcomings in his personal life make for an all the more interesting portrait in this extraordinary film Camera Obscura  910
1,This landmark film can now be seen in two different versions on the Grapevine Video release which also includes the English translation of Selma Lagerlofs novel which she based on a Swedish folktale The first version is the Swedish edit under the title of THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE The second version is a reconstruction of the way it was shown in the United States under the title of THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT as released by Metro before it was MG M The actual US release has long vanished but a detailed review in The New York Times lets us know how the scenes were reordered for domestic release  and both are fascinating to see Each version of this film was presented at The Organ Loft in Salt Lake City with live theatre organ scores provided by artist Blaine Gale A live recording was made of these performances and are included on the Grapevine Video DVD along with the novel and notes about the two versions While THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE follows the order of Lagerlofs novel THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT is in some ways easier to follow Seeing the two different edits is an education in how silent films could be changed effectively for release in different countries  Some viewers look at this film as a horror film which it certainly is not This is a morality play with shades of the supernatural used to hit home its stark message The directing and lead performance by the great Victor Sjostrom were way ahead of their time Its easy to see why MGM brought him to Hollywood to direct such films as Lillian Gish in THE SCARLET LETTER and THE WIND as well as Lon Chaney in HE WHO GETS SLAPPED In America he was known as Victor Seastrom He would also star in the lead role of Ingmar Bergmans WILD STRAWBERRIES giving a masterful performance Bergman was greatly influenced by KORKARLEN or THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE in his earlier days  This is a powerful film that is well worth taking some time to discover and study The Grapevine Video release is an excellent way to do this
1,Blue ribbon banners stars and stripes forever decorated generals and unconditional surrender from the enemies which required tons and tons of radiation this was the summon substance of the United States victory in World War II The celebration on Times Square as well as everywhere else in the United States suggests a national zenith America is on top right one thing one agonizing and painstakingly perverse thingThe period of adjustmentThe actual celebration ended when the bottle of champagne was finishedNow everyone needs to get on with their livesonly one problem thoughthey have to get new livesthe old lives are gone foreverPolite and pleasant smiles had a fragile facade with a longevity of ice cubes in boiling water Everyone of the characters in the movie is paraded by primal doubts and unable to masquerade a pretense about how nothing was seriously wrong for the simple reason that it was not true Once sergeants and generals and their wives and daughters and sons and virtually all other Americans touched by World War II were exposed to disabilities nightmares and recriminations of World War II and what it really accomplished as well as negated nobody was the same For now social and moral issues had a self serving interestFrederick March and Myrna Loy had to start over Dana Andrews realized that he should never have been married to Virginia Mayo in the first place Theresa Wright has become painfully aware of the fact that she is constructively selfish Las but not least the character Homer is about to get married and he thinks that everyone around him is as devastated by his injury as he is basically in the sense that they are unable or unwilling to cope The reason this film is so fabulous is because a happy ending was attained the hard way once everybody recognized the new beginning of the new United States and the new world overall tragedy from WWII was recognized and things that were emotionally torn asunder were taken in stride and dealt with accordingly Frederick March and Myrna Loy need to go back to chapter one in their marriage Homer has apprised his new bride as to what it takes to be married to him ie half the times she will feel like a nurse and Thresa Wrights involvement with Dana Andrews means that her entrance into adulthood has resulted in partial responsibility for breaking up a marriageThis is tantamount to learning how to drive a car to get your drivers license at the Indianapolis 500The characters in the movie are the typical post WWII Americans in that they are stalemated by the rude awakening of coercive changes to their livesHappiness no longer is afforded the luxury of the adjective copaestheticit is now about formidable conditions and good winning out over evil by way of the less ugly choiceWorld War II did not just happen It will henceforth dominate the social patterns of American living The aggregate catastrophe of World War II has mirrored most Americans feelings of personal human inadequacy as wellI loved this film and so did AFI probably for the reason that it brought out issues that were at one time unjustifiably tabooBottom line see this movie Nightmares about combat dilemmas about marital unhappiness andor readjustment coping with your life when strickened by a disability and just basically acting human are portrayed constantly in movies and television today HOWEVER this is 1946 Very new to Americans thenREMEMBER THAT Director William Wyler has illustrated how Americans feel about the aftermath of WWII in the days when the movie industry has left him with one hand tied behind his back Take that into account and you will probably realize just how sensational this movie really was
1,Like a few people I know I came in late on Stingers not until 2000 Three years later there is no way Id miss an episode The show really is that good and has for a better word maintained its integrity unlike Blue Heelers for example The crime is the thing personal lives are there but only wheeled out when affecting an investigation When Gary Sweet was brought in some fans seemed worried but hes really fitted in well which didnt surprise me Gary could measure up to any British or US actor in a similar series The cast changes occasionally but each change brings something new and fresh With arguably Australias finest crew behind the scenes Stingers will continue to remain a cutting edge drama series
1,Where this movie is faithful to Burroughs vision it is excellent where it departs from Burroughs it is superb It is a tale of family of the seeking of a father by a real and emotional orphan Lamberts speaking of one of the most anguished lines in all of cinema He was my Father is enough to bring tears to the eyes of the most cynical critic Not a perfect motion picture  the notorious overdubbing of McDowells voice by Glenn Close is unconscionable and only explicable in terms of a very British error  but a fine if flawed masterpiece and a noble farewell to Sir Ralph Richardson
1,Having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make a banquet of beauties into a delightful meal day to day this movie hits the mark Good afternoon fare I understand that Louis Jordan wanted to work in this movie to play opposite the quintessential GORGEOUS Suzy Parker Everyone wanted to be in and I believe it has done well and held up over time Best on screen kiss between Hope Lange and the late Stephen Boyd It may not appear that anything of this is plausible but actually it was and probably still is even given the scare of sexual harassment I thought the movie was well cast except the awful acting of Evans What a grease ball but he found his niche someplace else Other than that all stepped up to the plate
1,A powerful movie that has recovered much of its meaning in this second half of 2007 after the new desperate movements of the Burmese people against their tyrants I felt a complex mix of feelings about the people there something like compassion and admiration at the same time together with a bit of rage because I feel that no one neither the countries of the world nor themselves is doing anything effective to end this shame I think these feelings became directly from the movie and that they were intended when it was made so it is a successful movie The desire for peace the quest for enlightenment the respect for life sometimes leads to subjugation In fact it is the Buddhist Burmese culture who has left the doors wide opens to their dictators But how can you feel angry about these poor people
1,Mention Bollywood to anyone with a slight familiarity with the genre and the images usually conjured up are of tacky over the top musical numbers peopled with costuming that makes Vegas seem a bastion of conservatism This perception is not helped by the whiff of condescension that permeates most movies that have approached Bollywood from an outsiders perspective Willard Carrolls romantic comedy Marigold however takes a different tack It is not a nudgenudge winkwink look at those silly people and their clueless antics but a sincere appreciation of Bollywood for its vitality its lack of irony and selfconsciousness It is obvious that the director has a tremendous affection and respect for Bollywood while at the same time is bemused by its kitschier aspects And if you have a familiarity with Bollywood you can appreciate what he does here in making a true hybrid of Bollywood and Hollywood movie conventions From one of the opening shots a flashback of the Salman character as a child by the sea talking with his grandmother played by Helen  how many Salman movies start with this same premise to the flashback sequence that is incorporated into the movie that Marigold and Prem has been filming anyone who has seen enough Bollywood movies will recognize these references The story itself incorporates tried and true conventions from both Hollywood and Bollywood as well  the fish out of water meets dutytoonesfamilyat the expense of personal fulfillment The structure of the film follows the typical Bollywood plot line of the more comical set up of the first half giving way to a more dramatic resolution of the second Yet ultimately the sensibility of the film is that of Hollywood with its understated wry humor and its story of a woman learning to believe in herself to reach selfaffirmation You couldnt have a movie inspired by Bollywood if there werent any musical numbers and this movie does not disappoint with seven of them Unlike Bollywood however the songs do not pop out of nowhere and transport its characters to a European locale or Goan beach they exist as musical numbers that are part of the film that is being made reminiscent of how musical numbers were justified in Busby Berkeley movies as being part of a stage show Or they come out of a situation where music already has a reason to be there  a sexy nightclub scene where Prem teaches Marigold to dance or a beach scene where there are musicians including a cameo from the playback singer Shaan performing All reflect the emotional state of the protagonists at that point in the movie Often the music will take a conventional song from one genre and put a twist on it from the other So in one of the highlights of the film where Marigold comes into her own the song picturazation is fairly typical of its genre  the female star singing and dancing among a line of women  but in this case its blond Ali Larter looking like a total natural Bollywood film star emoting and lip synching to the Hindi lyrics with no subtitles Also synonymous with Bollywood are sumptuous visuals and Marigold fulfills that aspect beautifully thanks to some of the top talent working in Bollywood today The cinematographer is Anil Mehta who was also the cinematographer for Lagaan and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam The choreographer is Vaibhavi Merchant and production designer is Nitin Desai both from Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Devdas You can really see the influence of Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam on this film  in fact the illuminated floor in one of the numbers was originally from Dholi Taro Dhol which coincidentally has an embedded Marigold pattern As for the cast Carroll obviously has a penchant for spotting acting talent as evidenced by Playing by Heart  one of the first movies for both Angelina Jolie and Ryanne Phillippe And in this film he again hits the mark with Ali Larter One of the main reasons the film works is because of Larter She makes a bitchy unappealing character sympathetic and her subsequent transformation believable and she is smart funny and sexy because she is smart and funny She and Salman share excellent chemistry and that is one of the films biggest strengths Salman Khan plays the role of Prince Charming here as filtered through his iconic role as Prem This is old school Prem however so expect a quiet subdued Salman  those used to him in his usual stripping avatar may be disappointed  or relieved Its a sincere and sensitive performance from him marred only by poor enunciation of his English lines With a refreshing lack of cynicism and unabashed embrace of romantic love the film is a love letter to Bollywood and Hollywood movies of yore
1,This is a stunning movie Raw and sublimely moving It felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences All of the main players are mesmerising Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike Julian Fellowes has triumphed again Hes a national treasure Gosford Park Vanity Fair Mary Poppins and now this Can he do no wrong GO AND SEE IT This is a film for real grownups
1,The mere presence of Sam Waterston as an Indian is enough to put this movie in the mustsee category He is both beautiful and very subtle with no lines whatsoever He is tender with his kidnappee and yet we can see he is among the proudest of all young Indian Men Martin Sheen is just a dumb cluck who decides to challenge Waterston White Bull for a gorgeous white horse Other subplots are really unnecessary I dont understand the part played by Caroline Langrishe as the poor girl who White Bull kidnapsI dont know how she keeps her hands off this beautiful Indian man Its a lot of fun though especially if youre a Waterston fan Man he looks GOOD in this one Harvey Keitels role isnt even worth mentioning to tell the truth But rent it and enjoy Actually I do believe that if the music score was better it wouldve been a more dramatic filmthe music is so bad its distracting Still  theres Mr Waterston
1,Well let me put it this way  I have always been one of the hardcore brothers Ive always loved rock music and especially heavy metal Thats why this movie is like a gift from God I believe this movie is one of the best movies ever well except from Neverending Story and Star Wars of course  Its great to hear all the classics like Long live rock and roll DIO Stranglehold Ted Nugent songs by Jon Bon Jovie Deep Purple ACDC Zakk Wylde and several other legendary rock bands Heavenly Absolutely gorgeous WONDERFUL I hope they will make more movies like this otherwise its just crap movies like that AC in da USA or what they call it and 8 miles Bulls Well I strongly recommend this anyway Everything Im missing is a couple of Stratovariussongs But except from that its one of the best movies ever Ten out of ten
1,Dallas stars Gary Cooper Ruth Roman Steve Cochran Barbara Payton  Raymond Massey Its directed by Stuart Heisler photography is from Ernest Haller  pen duties fell to John Twist Produced out of Warner Brothers Dallas is vividly filmed in Technicolor out of the Iverson  Warner ranches in California Very much a film with its tongue firmly in cheek the film is a throwback to the Westerns of yore that exist without pretensions or deep penetrative meanings The plot sees Coopers Civil War renegade Blayde Reb Hollister fake his own death so as to kill off his reputation and to free himself for the pursuit into Dallas of the brothers who massacred his family In essence a routine plot Twists story is perked up along the way by many a fun and exciting diversion Theres role reversals dandy fashions horseback pursuits shoot outs a love triangle vigorous dialogue and deft little twists to keep the piece purely from painting it by numbers Cooper seems to be enjoying himself too which further enhances the feel good factor on offer Its true he isnt really asked to do anything more than be a laconic dude on a mission But when called on for action duties he delivers the goods that his fans have come to expect during his successful career The villains entertain particularly Steve Cochrans vile and dopey Bryant Marlow because each have their own little peccadilloes to keep them from over familiar blandness The two ladies of the piece look gorgeous and hold up well in amongst the machismo while the high production value allows Haller to really treat the eyes with the lush Technicolor and involving camera work around the locations It has ideals to being an A list Oater does Dallas something it just cant quite attain But its not for lack of trying and the end result is one of pure entertainment that in truth should be enjoyed on a cold winters day when the viewer needs a pick me up 710
1,Ive never seen a Bollywood film before but I caught the first ten minutes of this laughed myself silly and hit the R button on Sky Im glad I did I hope I dont insult anybody because basically the BF and I loved it but we couldnt take it half as seriously as the actors did  especially the obsessed one who I understand is a huge Bollywood star because weve seen him on the cover of lots of dvds since and i even saw a doll of him today in Hamleys The BF keeps on about this bloke  I am beginning to think HES obsessed He keeps saying that its strange for the traditionally good looking one to be the antihero of a film But then we do like films that arent your stock predictable Hollywood fare It was completely over the top but really good fun If all Bollywood films are like this then were watching more I have had that bloomin song in my head all week and I cant speak a word of Hindi PS any recommendations would be appreciated
1,So many times Bollywood has tried to remake Hollywood hits only to produce total duds Mercifully Yash Chopras interpretation of Sleeping with the Enemy is an extremely stylish and wellmade films Shah Rukh Khan is obsessed with Juhi Chawla whos looking her very best in here When he realizes that Juhi has a fiance in Sunny Deol he stops at nothing to make sure she becomes his Every frame of this film is a delight to watch Whether its Shah Rukh chanting his trademark I love you Kkkkiran or the feelgood mushy scenes between Sunny and Juhi who make a perfect match you wont feel like leaving your eat in boredom Each and every song on the soundtrack is ear pleasing especially Jaadu Teri Nazar and Tu Mere Samne Like I said Juhi looks like a Goddess in this film Darr may not be SRKs best film that honor goes to Baazigar but it definitely figures as one of his most flawless performances Sunny is OK Hes done similar roles before but hes good Overall Darr is ggggreat 
1,Romuald et Juliette is one of those French romantic comedies where they seem to break all the rules rather like Trop Belle Pour Toi The gorgeous Daniel Auteuil learns about true loyalty and love when his life threatens to crash around his ears The film isnt a preachy morality tale but a wonderful story that will keep you hooked until the last Firmine Richard as Juliette is a heroine that women will cheer  her laughter is my abiding memory of this warm and witty film The downtoearth way she has of including all her children by their different fathers  particularly the birthdays  gives the film an edge that lifts it above your average romantic comedy But its always the French that seem to show us how effortless this all is
1,Yes this is one of the greats of the black action genre Confusing mixture of racist comedy and racist violence at times reaching a disturbing pitch even for a fan of the genre this movie isnt your Shaft in the park Wonderful bits of Rudy Ray Moore comedy stand up that dont seem funny at least not to a white boy like me but great in context Much better than its dissimilar sequel The Human Tornado
1,Before I talk about the ending of this film I will talk about the plot Some dude named Gerald breaks his engagement to Kitty and runs off to Craven Castle in Scotland After several months Kitty and her aunt venture off to Scottland Arriving at Craven Castle Kitty finds that Gerald has aged and he has grown meaner Gerald has certain rules for the castlethe rules have been the same for 200 years Gerald does not want them to stay but Kitty insist on staying by making excuses One night her aunt catches a glimpse of the monster running across the hall It scares her so much that she faints and another excuse they must stay longer Kitty becomes more worried about Gerald after she tries to go in the maze but Gerald catches her and is even meaner to her Kitty then sends for reinforcements she calls their doctor who is actually their friend and his wide Then to make things not look suspicious they invite a couple other friendswho dont really do anything Blahblah blah Kitty and her aunt end up in the maze where the most suspense of the story is They somehow get separated and they try to find each other But the aunt stumbles upon the creaturehere it is the moment weve all been waiting for what is the creature lurking in the shadowsit is a giant FROG OMG what is better than that After seeing the aunt the frog literally goes crazy and runs oops I mean hops up the stairs to the top of the castle The frog then leaps out an open window We then go on a shot from the ground and see the frog gall towards us oh yeah this movie was in 3D But you want to know what is funny is the frog that falls out the window is actually a toy because it is 110 the size of the frog before it takes the leap It is then revealed that this was all evolutions fault blah blah and Kitty and Gerald get married Then the last shot of this masterpiece is of the grave of the frog in the maze the only place where he was ever really happy 
1,When i watch this movie i too get excited when seen bed scenes of miss world She has beautiful and charming body When cute lady do bed scenes and show her fully nude body i think male have hard to resisti think its time for cute girls like hrishita bhatt also do nude scenes At least no one wants to c nude body of ugly women like Seema biswas to c in bandit queenI concur with what mallickab has said The movie is portrayed in a way which appears to be a kind of vilification on the original content Emotions arent conveyed properly I guess a couple of notsogood performances also contributed to its mediocrity In my view Tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of Aishwarya Rai In some of her scenes she looks a bit lusty which is not ultimately what the movie should have portrayed I also noticed a bit of overacting in some of her scenes Im a bitter critic of Aishwarya Rai  Cant help it sorry for that Raincoat was a good movie by Rituparno Ghosh And I saw Choker Bali after seeing Raincoat I was not at all impressed
1,I just saw this on cable I liked it It held my interest and the dramatic choices were good The old couple were very good and good at being subtly creepy The cinematography is not so great but the shabby video also adds to the sense of realism so its a tradeoff you know At times the girl would hit the New England accent to hard The accent would sort of come and go Anyway I thought the film was well done overall though The storyline was strong and dramatic tension was held because you felt their was some subtle mystery going on even though things seemed mundane Good job on a low budget Another good SUNY Purchase filmmaker Way to go
1,Great horror comedy from Michael DavisIwas laughing so hard i almost peed Great acting from Eric Jungman as the good guy who saves the day  great performance by the Jack Blackesquire like performance from Justin Urich He was just divine in this film This guy deserves to be a big star AlsoAimee Brooks was good in the film as well as the girl in danger along with the guys from a killer reminiscent of Jeepers Creepers The gore to was given in copious amounts  i loved itI just hope they release a not rated version Great lowbudget Horror Comedy The dead cat in the hotel sex scene is just gruesomely funny  out of 
1,I watch Lackawanna Blues every time it comes on It brings back happy times for me I grow up in a big city in the midwest It reminds me of when I was a child although my situation was a little different it feels the same It makes me wonder if all we will ever know about families are lost The big mamas of day are under the age of 55 Will they see know what it takes to be a inspiration to other I hope that I was not the only one who loved this movie enough to relate it to their past The music was great in this movie I truly felt like this should have gone to the theaters I would have paid to see it As I viewed the movie for the second time I figured out who life this movie was about He did an superb job in writing and producing this film I guess who better to produce a film based on your life other than you As soon as I can I will be obtaining a copy for my home use I alway enjoy black producer or directors they make such film feel like you were actually living in the time right than Thanks for such a great movie
1,Cleopatra 2525 is a very funny entertaining show You shouldnt take all the show seriously but if you wanna have fun thats your TV show Being made by the producers of Xena is a quality guarantee and Cleopatra 2525 isnt that different from Xena The female warriors formula is brought to the future where they dont have to fight warriors or gods but dangerous robots which dwell in the surface and the humans are forced to live underground Along the two seasons of Cleopatra they develop an interesting and funny underground world and we get to know the three main characters Cleopatra Jennifer Sky Hel Gina Torres and Sarge Victoria Pratt They all are different but as a team they work really well The three main actresses appeared previously in Xena like most of the regularguest cast there are some known faces from Hercules too or from both shows I specially liked the character played by Danielle Cormack Ephiny in Xena which is very different from any of her roles I previously knew So if you liked Xena and Hercules youll love Cleopatra 2525 If you dont know them try it Im sure youll enjoy it
1,Excellence seems to come rare in Hollwood today Many consider just two out of the years best picture nominees to display sense to the movie industry And in Everything is Illuminated the mark is hit directly The film initiates its brilliance with the beautiful settingthescene entry From the beginning you receive a sense of warmth and true family connections and relations between one and another And also the cast is introduced perfectly For Elijah Woods character Jonathon his sensibility is expressed through holding his dying grandmothers hand And for the character entitled Alex it is easy to see his life in his perspective  the true Ukrainian rock star With the cast illuminated at first the story slowly eases into our minds as Jonathon decides to venture to Ukraine to meet the woman believed to save his grandfather thus the entire family And from there the story movies slowly yet kept at a fast pace from the contrast of teardripping drama and laughoutloud humor included in scenebyscene every scene Although the movie itself is rather awarding there are several complaints from other sources commenting about Liev Schriebers inaccurate adaptation of the Jonathon Safron Foer novel Personally I have never read the novel But any movie especially this movie in particular should not be graded on whether the storyboard of the film matches the storyline of the book but rather how the major concepts from the novel were expressed and exploited through the film Just because it may be farfetched from the novel does not mean that this film is no longer a mustsee  it still is Throughout the film new information inundates the audiences mind very slowly Some of these thoughts are never answered and in fact the second half of the movie refocuses its entire topic and reason of travel through Ukraine onto something different yet rather similar to the original intentions of this film The film does however leave you on a satisfied note  yet to the weakhearted souls a tear may be dropped And throughout the film to the saneful people with common sense of humor may just have to laugh from Alex and Johns fun and ongoing conversations I would recommend this film to several different types of people to those whom enjoy movies that share the genre dramacomedy for those who have an interest in family connections and to those whom have an interest in Holocaustic subjects And to those insane people who find slapstick as hilarious comedy this movie is not for you And for you whom think that this is a seriously funny and absolutely ingeniously funny film you are wrong this film shares comedic moments and dramatic sequences And to those whom judge a movie based on their likeliness with its corresponding novel you may or may not enjoy this film but this film should be taken for much more than whether or not it was close to the book All in all Everything is Illuminated is an ingenious piece of work that will enlighten anyones hearts
1,Minor Spoilers will follow This movie is even more odd and unconventional than songs from the second floor There is no main character we follow around There is no plot in the conventional way There is no emphasis on an happy end There is no crowdpleasing In other words Roy Andersson is back with a vengeance Instead of falling back on convention and fixed formula Roy Andersson concentrates his film around an idea I will not go into what that idea is but even if you dont get it i promise that you will see the greatest visual depth ever put to film The majestic scenes from songs pale in comparison here A work of visual splendor So be kind to your fellow man because after all we are the living and only you and I have the power to change our lives That is at least what I thought when I saw the final scene in the movie with the inhumane bomber planes sweeping in over the city in the film to take our lives away  And of course dont forget to see this movie when it gets a limited release near you This is one of those movies that actually have the power to make you a better person like de Sicas Bicycle Thieves A very warm and humanistic film
1,Picture this Someone makes a film about the Columbine or Virginia tech massacre only the film is directed by the guy who did home alone i know this isnt but bare with me and stars Sean Astin off of Goonies picture the terrorists being overpowered by buckets of water on top of ajar doors and marbles and this is why you need to see the film unfortunately it doesnt go all the way by actually having the skateboard lying on the floor for the evil Mexicans to trip on but its halfway there you have to give it above 7 for that but not a 9 because it didnt go crazy enough Pity its seemed like it would be comical cheesiness well worth a cult status
1,This is a fun movie with subtle intention Its offbeat comedy is hilarious to me unfunny to my friends The soundtrack is perfect I own this on VHS and I have watched it many many times because its simply a fun and funny love story with great performances by all the principals though using Joan Cusack solely as a perch for big hair was a waste of her talent I know I know she was still young On a sad note I decided to check out the DVD last night instead of watching my VHS tape and was SHOCKED to find many crucial scenes cut And on the copy I watched there was no special feature of deleted scenes it was as if the deleted scenes never existed I am so glad I bought the used VHS at a flea market It is clear there was a great deal of choreography in this which is another reason I love it so much It takes great skill talent and genius to move around the scenes like Mercedes Ruehl Dean Stockwell and Matthew Modine do from scene to scene Note the scene when the grocery carts converge the rolling on the floor during the shootout in Miami the Chicken Lickin debacle the foot massage the salon hairwashing There is a very theatrical feel to this film which may be the turnoff for so many whose poor reviews follow I know some viewers who dont quite understand this style mistake the exaggerations and overthetop performances for poor acting and worse direction Not so Jonathan Demme does a great job bringing to life the entire company and their respective roles The opening credits and first scene rank among my alltime favorites as well another favorite opening creditsfirst scene Fly Away Home Too bad Matthew Modine so ardently skipped out of the public eye I really like him and found his casting PERFECT in the role of Mike Smith Actually this film is wellcast from soup to nuts everyone is believable and true to his role As for the question of expecting audience to accept Pfeiffer and Stockwell as Italians  why not I thought they pulled it off perfectly well Charming fun exciting what is there not to like If you want a little fun watch this quirky colorful adventuremoblove story If you are looking to learn more about organized crime and families tune to HBOs The Sopranos
1,Many people have the irritating habit of dying before completing a vital message thus confusing the hero not to mention the audience Dr Ben McKenna James Stewart and his wife Jo a former musical star Doris Day are vacationing in Morocco with their son Hank Christopher Olsen when they meet Mr and Mrs Drayton a British couple Brenda de Banzie and Bernard Miles They are also befriended by a charming Frenchman Louis Bernard Daniel Gelin who invites them to dinner but then cancels at the last minute The MacKennas go to a restaurant and end up having their meal with the Draytons when they spot Louis Bernard  The next day in the market place they are caught in an assassination intrigue While they are wandering in the local market the crowds suddenly scatter to reveal an Arab fleeing from his pursuers Dr McKenna stands amazed as the Arab falls into his arms a knife sticking out of his back  Gulping his last breath the dying man mutters some words and collapses Dr McKenna is completely taken aback when the Arabs hood falls from his head and he is revealed as Bernard in disguise McKenna is left knowing too little but as far as the assassins are concerned too much To prevent Dr McKenna from revealing what he knows the conspirators kidnap his son as a hostage The film is primarily concerned with the dilemma of kidnappinghow to get the little boy back safely The subplot about the assassination is just the setup The film is a breathless escapade The death of Bernard comes suddenly and points out that death comes when we least expect it  Stewart is charged with emotion as the Midwestern doctor accidentally involved in political intrigue His perceptive facial expressions and indignant delivery made him convincingly humana person we could easily identify with It is his temperament that actually sets the pace for the entire film  By 1956 the lovely Doris Day had won increasing esteem as an actress as well as a singer She had been particularly strong opposite James Cagney in the Ruth Ettings biopic Love Me or Leave Me but she was still unsure of her basic Thespian talents The casting of character actor Reggie Malder as the assassin is brilliant The man looks like a menace and his effusive portrayal radiates evil
1,I had never read much about or even seen stills of the sixman British comedy group The Crazy Gang but my positive experiences with their contemporaries Will Hay and Arthur Askey – and especially Graham Greenes high praise of THE FROZEN LIMITS itself “The funniest English picture yet produced…it can bear comparison with SAFETY LAST and THE GENERAL” – made me take the plunge with the barebones R2 DVDs from Network of this and their subsequent film GASBAGS 1941 see below both of which were released earlier this year with virtually no fanfare A Britishmade Western is a rarity but a British Western spoof is rarer still CARRY ON COWBOY 1965 was still some 25 years away Incidentally going back to the Silent classics mentioned by Greene the film seems to me to be more obviously indebted to THE GOLD RUSH 1925 and WAY OUT WEST 1937 Besides it also plays like a variation on the “Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs” fairytale which had just been immortalized on the screen via Walt Disneys animated masterwork and where the seventh member is played by ancient comic and frequent Will Hay foil Moore Marriott the Gang actually call pretty heroine Eileen Bell by that name throughout and theres even an amusing sequence with the six of them preparing to go to bed and whistling the dwarfs song from the Disney film  Six comedians three sets of comedy duos Flanagan  Allen Nervo  Knox and Naughton  Gold may be the largest such grouping on film – though not all of their personalities emerge here my favorites were big Bud Flanagan looking a bit like Jim Backus straight man Chesney Allen and moustached squeakyvoiced Teddy Knox however bald Charlie Naughton often took the limelight – since hes the one on which the others always seemed to pick on Still its Marriott who steals the film from his very first scene – where he contrives to impersonate every official in the dilapidated theater of a ghost town a very young Bernard Lee is also notable as the villain of the piece The Ore routine between Flanagan and Allen actually anticipates Abbott and Costellos famous “Whos On First” the film in fact hinges on a lot of wordplay for its humor – which doesnt necessarily travel especially at this juncture Nevertheless there are several hilarious sequences throughout – a few of which even brought tears to my eyes the opening scene where the Gang are defrocked by a band of angry creditors their dressing up as Indians once they hit the Yukon the Gangs ruse to make everybody rich with the same piece of gold they all impersonate the sleepwalking Marriott to confuse the villains a gag which may owe its origin to the Marx Bros hilarious mirror sequence in DUCK SOUP 1933 the spoton theater sketch which pokes fun at hoary melodramas the surreal moment when pursued by the villains one of the Gang climbs a staircase that is part of the painted scenery in the theater and especially towards the end when a group of singing Mounted Police gallop ever so slowly to the Gangs rescue despite being egged on by the increasingly impatient Ranger hero The thinny soundtrack and the frantic nature of the gags themselves made it hard for me to get all the jokes sometimes – subtitles would certainly have been welcome in this case The Crazy Gang only made five films – with the first two also being wellregarded OKAY FOR SOUND 1937 and ALFS BUTTON AFLOAT 1938 and a much later reunion though Allen had by this time bowed out due to illhealth and been replaced by Eddie Gray called LIFE IS A CIRCUS 1960 directed by Val Guest who incidentally cowrote both Gang films I purchased as well as some of the aforementioned Hay and Askey vehicles
1,This ladies and gentlemen is truly a modern Bmovie The dialog is stilted and delivered with wooden rigidity the premise is predictable there are a few decent twists and characters remain 2D for most of it And yet there is a certaincharm WWE wrestler Kane brings to life the sick twisted monster of a man with a lot of pathos though it is somewhat like his character that hes been playing around ten years and so Ill find it quite amusing when people say its not much of a reach for him but Glen Jacobs is apparently quite the nice guy so actually it is In any event hes cast perfectly as the hulking brute and the deaths are suitably over the top Jason would be proud but I heard at least four applause breaks for four different kills scenes Frankly go into this movie thinking that youll have some fun and a gorefest oh it is QUITE the gorefest The Rrating IS richly deserved and I actually got a little nauseous during some of the more graphic times In any event a very very fun but fairly bad movie
1,This film is totally mindblowing It manages to be thought provoking funny tragic and cinematic yet claustrophobic Although the flashbacks are unnecessary the film maintains a pacy punchy grip and the performances are all excellent in particular Alec Baldwin and the mesmerising Eric Bogosian as the films antihero Barry Champlain
1,I agree with BigAlC  this movie actually prepared me for a lot of the cultural differences and practices before I went to live in Japan for a year in 1993 Tom Selleck does a fantastic job here as always and the movie is greatly humorous and educational Im a big fan of Tom Sellecks and he blesses this part with his usual charm and charisma to this part bringing the film to life in a way I cant imagine any other actor being able to pull off  This film featured some firstrate Japanese actors and it was highly entertaining to watch them as they interacted with Selleck  I can imagine the fun he had during the actual filming of the movie  Japans an awesome place to go whether you want to party sightsee or just try to take everything in
1,Famed filmmaker Werner Herzogs Fata Morgana is breathtakingly unorthodox Although characters appear in the film from time to time there is no actual story The film is also not an educational or historical documentary Its a film without an accompanying screenplay The film consists of curious background music and a somewhat illogical narrative VO the combination of which overlays a long string of images from mostly though not exclusively the Sahara Desert Some of the images are wonderfully odd and out of the ordinary The camera captures ghostly images or mirages optical illusions that tantalize and mesmerize This general cinematic trend is punctuated by occasional observational asides on serendipitous topics For example in one sequence a man wearing goggles gives us a minitutorial on lizards And in what for me was the most captivating and bizarre sequence a small inset room contains a man with dark goggles who sings in a voice that is totally distorted by the microphone hes using accompanied by an old lady who plays a punchy tune on an old piano Neither the man nor the old lady seems to enjoy what theyre doing How baroque Fata Morgana does have an underlying concept one that unites the wide assortment of strange images and eclectic sounds But that concept is so subtle so opaque that youll never figure it out without help From this subtle theme the film does indeed make sense Without that point of reference however the film can seem tedious and unending a pointless parade of random earthy images and esoteric narrative gibberish Unapologetically redundant thematically baffling and cinematically heretical Fata Morgana will likely either make you swoon with delight or cause you to throw up Youll either latch on to the films Zenlike qualities or be tempted to smash the DVD into a thousand pieces One thing that most viewers will agree on Fata Morgana is  different
1,The creative team that brought us Police Squad  and the Naked Gun derived from it  said in interview that they were told by their network contact that the show would be canceled after their delivery of the first episode Basically the show was never given any chance Typical Hollywood The contact apparently told the team that the problem with the show was that for the show to be funny the viewer would actually need to watch it most shows are presented on TV with the understanding that the viewer needed to get up and miss a few minutes while getting food or going to the toilet etc The humor of the show is extremely dry it uses no laughtrack and the universe the characters inhabit is one in which anything can happen regardless of logic as long as it was totally unbelievable so for instance in one episode a surgeon has to bribe an informant on the street in order to get a tip on heart surgery Those familiar with the Naked Gun films should be warned that there are a number of interesting disjunctions between the show and the films In the films Nielsen developed a particular take approach  that is eyes widened when confronted with the unexpected This doesnt happen in the show where Nielsens Drebin is the center around which the rest of the universe revolves  nothing is unexpected to him Also there are no romances in the show and no parodies of MTV Finally the show takes certain risks that the films avoid in the first episode Drebin to reenact the crime has a squad of homicide detectives shoot each other from a number of different angles  ballistics the hard way This is actually a risky bit of humor since we need to accept that its perfectly normal for policemen to kill each other while investigating a crime for no other reason than experimentation This sort of thing rarely happens in the films Taken individually each of the episodes is actually funnier than any one of the Naked Gun films since they are both more compact more happens in a shorter timeframe yet more leisurely paced theres not the rush for a punchline as sometimes happens in the films There are some inconsistencies that happen in the films primarily 2 and 3 that never occur in the shows shorter timeframe Of course theres no doubt that Naked Gun the first film is one of the great comedies of theatrical cinema And if you watch the TV show episode after episode in one sitting the dry quality of the humor might wear away ones tolerance None the less it would be useful to have a DVD of this and watch an episode a day for a few weeks  If laughter has as some claim medicinal value watching this show is good for ones health
1,A brutally straightforward tale of murder and capital punishment by the state So painfully slow and accurate in the description of capital punishment from the preparation of the gallow to the victim ping in his own pants before dying it has the power to change your mind about death penalty The whole Dekalog originated from this story the Dekalog screenwriter was the powerless lawyer unsuccessfully trying to defend and then console the accused
1,This cheapo remake of the terrific Five Star Final suffers from terrible acting Humphrey Bogart stars as the manager of a sleazoid radio station that is desperate to boost sagging ratings The owner decides to have a series of morality plays written about a famous murder case from 20 years ago So they hire the fake preacher Harry Hayden to track down the murderess who was acquitted and has been living quietly under a fake name The preacher arrive on the daughters wedding day but the ruthless radio station refuses to back off exposing the mother and ruining their lives Bogart is always good Hayden is good the the slimy preacher and Henry ONeill is good as the father Everyone else is just awful Helen McKeller wins no sympathy crucial for the role Linda Perry is a lousy actress Beverly Roberts is OK but always looks old Claire Dodd and Hobart Cavanagh have no parts Carlyle Moore is a dud as the boy friend Virginia Brissac is miscast as the society mother Robert Middlemas overacts as the station owner This one comes in under an hour but is a pale copy of the original which boasted dynamic performances by Edward G Robinson Aline MacMahon Frances Starr and Boris Karloff But its always worth watching Boagrt
1,Although They Died with their Boots On is not entirely historically accurate it is a very entertaining western Not only is Flynn the perfect Custer the character actors are superb Besides the action portion of the movie Flynn and DeHavillands love scenes are very touching and believableFlynn and DeHavilland were very fond of each other in real life Flynn was always so tormented for being not taken seriously if only he knew that there were very few actors who could play the characters he played and play them well
1,I was surprised that I liked this movie But it reminded me of a 2004 version of the first Friday the 13th There were a number of cheesy elements yet at the same time there were many cool ones The story line was goodpredictable if you have seen more than one or two horror movies but full of oneliners to make it worthwhile There are some memorable scenes worth watching A few issues I had with the plot had to do with the continuity of the characters For instance in the opening scene the scarecrows which were humans on stakes whose blood was drained to grow the crops looked very real but later in the film they looked more like fake scarecrows wearing blue colored masks There were more than several gaps in the plot and the acting was mediocre but at least it sounded like how real people talk unlike Hollywood movies where the dialogue is really fake sounding when you think about it The culmination of the last scene when the main character says Im not a Baker Im a Connell and lops the head off of the scarecrow is satisfying as his friends have for the most part been killed off by these creatures at that point
1,In 1961 this series was shown on local TV here in southern California I and many others have been petering BBC for tape or DVD ever since Now all of a sudden here it is on Amazon I preordered in January and now here on March 30 it arrived It was a long wait 48 years Was it worth it So far I have just watched Richard II Ive only had the DVD since 2 oclock and I can truly say YEA totally worth the wait The acting direction and production are superb and even better than I remember The production is in B  W but somehow it fits The video is clear and very good the sound is flawless Further proof of how timeless Shakespeare truly is I gave this 10 stars even though I have only seen 1 of the 8 plays I am sure that when I have seen them all I will change my rating to at least a 12 Its currently in stock at Amazon US region 1 at a reasonable price Id better stop now so I can get back to watching Next up is Henry the IV part 1 of which is my all time favorite Shakespeare play
1,The entire movie an artful adaptation of one of Joyces Dubliners stories takes place on the night of January 6 Epiphany 1906 Most of the film takes place at an annual party given by three spinsters two sisters and their niece where a group of upperclass Dubliners gather for an evening of music recitations and dinner While there is very little plot per se the interaction and conversation among the group reveals much about Dublin in the early 20th century when the stirrings for independence were just beginning The cast all talented Irish stage actors with the exception of Anjelica Huston are universally wonderful and one actually feels he is a guest at the gathering himself The poignant final scene between Ms Huston and the amazing Donal McCann reveals much about the marriage of the characters There is poignancy mixed with humor and insight and for those who like quiet thoughtful movies The Dead is highly recommended My wife is from Dublin we make a ritual of watching this wonderful movie every January 6th After many viewings it never fails to move me and each time I glean something that Ive missed before
1,Great movie Postapocalyptic films kick ass This one is no exception Kept up the pace and interest without a speck of dialogue mainly through some good character development The fight between Reno and the Hero was tight I also liked the use of cave paintings and medievallike weapons to show how primitive and savage mankind had become without their technology and guzzaline The connection between the beginning and end was a little spacey that is I had a hard time understanding the distances between the hotel and the opening sequence In sum kick ass character progression design story without the cushion of dialogue and most importantly the always appreciated desolate scenery of a postapocalyptic wasteland
1,Too much added with too much taken away from a great western that was written by McMurtry about the Texas Rangers vs the Indian This screenplay takes that away only to fill this mini series with a lot of warm fuzzy relationships that in truth were secondary to the main storyline It ends with a totally unbelievable and detached ending not written in the book that makes you question how we are to be transported to Lonesome Dove The series main characters were in truth cast very well the filming locations were excellent but this mini series should have stayed true to what is a great book
1,I suppose this is what is called Southern Gothic It stars Samuel L Jackson Christina Ricci and also Justin Timberlake is featured in a role Timberlake does good work much to my surprise I didnt expect it of him When youre lost and you cant find your way homethats the black snake moan The people in this movie are definitely lost in many ways psychologically and emotionally damaged betrayed by those they trusted and loved and filled with a lot of pain Samuel L Jackson plays a blues singermusicianwhose wife has messed around with his brother and now left him for his brother along with aborting a child he had hoped to have with her Christina Riccis character is a woman who was sexually abused when youngthis has turned her into a self destructive nymphomaniac allowing men to treat her badly The story lies in the intersection of these two characters lives It is a love story but not a sexual love story between themthe older black man and the young white woman It is different from most films Hollywood grinds out I highly recommend it 10 stars
1,The Wild Life has an obvious resemblance to Fast Times At Ridgemont High and The Wild Life comes up short   Some other stan wrote the above comment Of course The Wild Life is no Ridgemont Ridgemont is the quintessential 80s flica However the Wild Life is enjoyable if youre not whiny about mindless movies being mindless movies especially when you know its supposed to be a mindless movie in the first place The little Latino from Scarface is in this movie and hes straight disrespectful I got VisaMasterrrrr Charrrrge The Colonel also makes an appearance Lawsuit RIP The Colonel 19311997 This movie is no worse than a 6 in comparison to other genres btw It is no worse than a 7 in terms of other 80s teen comedies at that It does very much have the feel of a Cameron Crowe movie Only staniels gave it a 5
1,Aside from the fact that the women in the film are stunningly beautiful and all the camp prisoners are too fat this film rings true on the chaos of the postwar Beautiful photography and a powerful national expression of the Polish national character Its very slow at points but its entire pacing is so different from American and Western European films that its quite refreshing Both lead actors do a very good job On the DVD version you can see interviews with the principal actors and crew and the lead actress Stanislawa Celinska has gained about 50 lbs and lost all of her beauty But in 1970 she was a stunner
1,Writerdirector John Milius takes a littleknown incident from American history and extrapolates wildly in all the right ways The result is a grand adventure tale that showcases two of its stars in memorable largerthanlife roles Sean Connery as the wily Arab sheik with an inexplicable Scottish brogue and Brian Keith as President Theodore Roosevelt itching for the chance to put that big stick to good use Aided immeasurably by Billy Williams glorious widescreen cinematography and a magnificent score by the always reliable Jerry Goldsmith this early effort seemed the harbinger of a talent to rank with contemporaries Lucas Coppola and Spielberg Although Milius served up tantalizing glimpses of his ability in scripts for JEREMIAH JOHNSON and APOCALYPSE NOW his career seemed to take a downward turn not long after he started directing ultimately foundering on dreck like CONAN THE BARBARIAN and RED DAWN  Heres hoping that he will again find his way
1,Rita Hayworth as Rusty Parker is the COVER GIRL du jourshes one of the dancing girls in Danny McGuires club the most special one according to Danny Gene Kelly and pretty much anyone who comes across her Take for example Vanity magazine magnate John Coudair Otto Kruger enchanted by Rustys resemblance to her grandmother Maribelle also played by Hayworth in flashbacks whom he wooed devotedly when he fell in love with her he tries to relive his youth by fixing what he thinks went wrong between himself and Maribelle He doesnt believe that Danny could give Rusty happiness or everything she should be entitled tohe even gets Danny believing this himself When Rusty shoots to fame as Vanitys Cover Girl Danny drives her away into the ready and waiting arms of Noel Wheaton Lee Bowman So what happens when Danny returns to town with his sidekick Genius Phil Silvers in tow only to discover that Rusty is marrying Wheaton As a musical COVER GIRL benefits from the beautiful score and songs written by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin including the Oscarnominated Long Ago and Far Away possibly one of the most gorgeous ballads ever written and beautifully sweetly sung as a duet by Hayworth and Kelly Maribelles number Sure Thing the more lacklustre Poor John isnt a KernGershwin collaboration and Put Me To The Test The dancing of course is topnotch since Gene Kelly had more than just a hand in the choreography It shows in the simplest of dances for example his dance with Hayworth to Put Me To The Test or the joyfully exuberant Make Way For Tomorrow number performed by the trio of Danny Rusty and Genius which foreshadows the reaction Genes character has to the police cop in the title number in SINGIN IN THE RAIN Kelly especially scored a technological and artistic coup with the AlterEgo dance Like its successors in ANCHORS AWEIGH and AN AMERICAN IN PARIS Jerry the Mouse and the 16minute ballet respectively this dance is an example of the incredible innovation and creativity Kelly brought to the modern film musical wanting to use the film medium to present dances that couldnt be showcased on a stage and years before CGI Kelly insisted on dancing with the one person who could possibly match him in talent and stylehimself The number is hardly five minutes long but it and Kellys genius still takes ones breath away even sixty years down the line This is the reason I watched COVER GIRL and if nothing else this dance is truly worth it You can tell that a great deal of money was lavished onto COVER GIRL and Rita Hayworthnot that she doesnt deserve it Witness the scene when Rusty hits Broadwaythe large screen showcasing all the different cover girls gives way to a staggeringly large stage rigged for Rustys entrance Hayworth is indeed one of the most effortlessly beautiful girls on show in the film and she dances with a style and grace that is almost worthy of Kelly Very few of Kellys costars have that honour She is hilarious in some scenes for example her drunk scene when John and Wheaton come to get her from Joes For some reason however her performance still lacks the spark of greatness which would help COVER GIRL overcome its general curse of mediocrity That curse is only lifted whenever Gene Kelly is on the screen dancing or no or when Eve Arden as Johns longsuffering secretary Stonewall sidles by with another cutting comment or clever observation Since the film in the end belongs to Hayworth neither Kelly nor Arden can save it as a whole This isnt to say that the film is badit isnt Its enjoyable with great songs and cute numbers and lots of pretty girls to look at But its just not quite a classic The dancing is classic thoughso watch COVER GIRL for that and you wont regret it
1,Rented this out from my local because it was the only new British film available this week Never heard of the filmmaker before or his other films thank you IMDB About time some one made a good young British comedy that didnt star Hugh Grant or forty somethings The story is a morality tale but never preachy throughly enjoyable from a young and fresh faced cast Luke Gosss cameo was surprisingly very good but then he did surprise me with his excellent performance in Blade Loved the colour grading especially in the night club sequences Great music and a truly original voice at work here Nine out of ten and well worth the rental charge
1,I enjoyed some of the older Doctor Who many years ago so when the new one came out I just had to check it out I was SO pleased  with the characters the story lines the updated look I became hooked From Season 1 27 for the old fans through to season 2 28 it just keeps on getting better It ties in nicely with the old shows too although you dont have to know the old shows to enjoy this newer version Even though there has been a change of cast I highly recommend Doctor Who  with Chris Eccleston AND with David Tennant I like that theyve given the characters so much depth The Doctor seems more vulnerable in this series maybe because he is the last TimeLord The range of emotions which Chris and David show are truly remarkable and I felt their pain anger and sense of adventure right along with them  Billie Piper Rose brings a very human element to each episode although she is much braver than I would be With her talent Billie will go far in the industry
1,Colombian terrorists hold hostage a military school in the US until their demands are met The students decide to fight back Will they be able to do it Silly premise but the film actually works The group of kids who fight were all up and coming when this film came out in 1991 Sean Astin looking very cute Wil Wheaton looking miserable Keith Coogan George Perez the token Latino who is very handsome very muscular and is mostly shown in nothing but tight underwear TE Russell the token black guy and Shawn Phelan None of them are very good actors except Astin but who cares This is a mindless action film The only other good performances are from Denholm Elliott having a ball as the headmaster and Louis Gossett Jr as the dean Other than thattheres lots of action suspense explosions and little brains In other wordsFUN  Only complaint and this is minorits a bit too long there are THREE endings and there is LOTS of casual bloody violence the R rating was wellearned Still I enjoyed it a lot
1,The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film  If you remember the 1974 film then you will remember Kersey was a  Conchie  during the Korean war and that he was physically sick after he committed his first execution  Ten years later Kersey seems to have learned unarmed combat and how to handle anti tank weapons in his spare time  But Ill overlook that gaffe because DW3 is the best of the sequels  lowlife scum bags get shot dead  burned alive  their teeth smashed  and thrown to their deaths by middle aged housewives armed with sweeping brushes  Yeah I know the gang members are multi ethnic and for that they deserve some credit but even if theyre not racist theyre still murdering scum who deserve all they get from Kersey and the innocent citizens  Who needs Mayor Rudy when youve got Paul Kersey  an anti tank rocket and a bunch of old age pensioners to reclaim the streets from the criminal creeps  Paul Kersey I salute you sir
1,Wayne Wangs direction may be the ingredient which made this film much more impressive to me than Slums of Beverly Hills which covers remarkably similar ground The interplay between Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman is riveting Real chemistry there This film succeeded in bringing me inside the dysfunctional life of these two women without dragging me down into depressed frustration Susan Sarandons character hammers at all the nerves which a narcissistic parent is capable of touching in an insecure adolescent She amazingly manages to do this without coming across as floridly insane or intentionally sadistic And Natalie Portman deflects each attack on her characters ego with the resigned grace of an intelligent codependent child untainted by the smug cynicism of the Natasha Lyonne character in Slums of Beverly Hills Portmans character is an adolescent with dignity under stress an unusual creature in modern films The film reaches a very satisfying resolution without trying too hard I highly recommend this film to the viewer who wants to be challenged and entertained
1,I was geared up to not like this movie and the first 10 minutes or so did nothing to allay my fears It starts off with 2 high school gangs squaring off against each other with bad kungfu A scenario found in countless other Korean films Hohum Add the fact that the story was written by the same guy who wrote He Was Cool which was barely passable and well I thought I was in for a nondescript 2 hours But dont give up so quickly A Romance of Their Own was directed by Taegyun Kim who also did Volcano High which I thought was loads of fun Anyway Romance of Their Own soon takes a turn much for the better A high school girl just having moved to Seoul finds herself in the middle of attention from two prospective suitors Each guy has his own merit and it is not clear which one if either would be the right pick What follows is not your usual teen love triangle The emotions are complex and while you may not agree with certain choices or actions as the film develops you can certainly understand why the characters make them The movie asks questions of the characters and the audience Who does one choose At what point is one obligated to even make a choice and is it unfair to one if it seems he is being strung along After you or your heart has made a choice how do you react and how should you react when new information comes up that sheds new light on the situation There is one scene near the end that is very subtle but perfectly captures what I think would be a reallife reaction instead of overthetop movie reaction The subtlety is in a character in the background of the scene Recent events and revelations have left him confused and emotionally overwhelmed Basically he doesnt know what to make of things Instead of having him act out something or look all gapemouthed dumbstruck he just stares off at some fixed point unable to react or say anything at all Its like someone just pulled the plug on him His reaction rang true to me and I appreciated the scene Like most Korean films there is a mix of action bravado slapstick and melodrama Korean films often take abrupt turns see Sex Is Zero for a great example which can be quite a shock for the uninitiated Go ahead and initiate yourself with this one Like it love it or hate it I think most viewers will be able to relate to and appreciate the characters actions and reactions
1,If you loved the 1993 erotic scifictioncyborg film Nemesis then youll love this one I loved it the minute the Elvis Pompadoured hero pulls out a samurai sword during a shootout Like Nemesis its takes place in a post apocalyptic slum of the future Both are police thrillers where the well armed hero must take on well armed rebels to solve a conspiracy by the powers that be against the unwashed masses but thats where the similarities ends The ambiguous mayor in dead or alive tries to keep the masses sedate on the drugs he sells them The rebels aided by mercenaries and a cyborg try to brake his suffocating hold on his subjects After several failed attempts to brake the rebels back he sends his top cop to assassinate the rebels This movie follows the track of most action adventure but isnt afraid to color outside the line
1,I saw this movie in its brief run in art house cinema in 69 I found it so funny that I literally spent part of the movie on the floor having laughed so hard I fell out of my seat In retrospect years later I thought it had been done by Melvin Van Peebles When I mentioned it to a friend he said that a friend of his Downey Sr filled virtually every nonacting role in the flick Director writer producer etc He was right of course and my memory was wrong except that this WAS one of the funnies movies ever made The part of the Arab was particularly priceless
1,Thank you Mario Van Peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys but providing a compelling story that was easy to follow The plot backdrop music and talent were all top notch It was great that you used so many AfricanAmerican artists to tell the tale of the black cowboy It was also good to see Billy Zane in this movie Does he ever play a good guy I would highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to broaden their way of thinking This is an excellent movie and I feel privileged to have seen it Hopefully youll feel the same
1,Certainly this film is not for everybodybut for anyone with a sense of humor and love of period film Ð buy this immediately Where else can you get a run down of 70Õs fashion a period vocabulary primer karate trained hookers crime a rap about the TitanicÕs sinking shoot outs and a costar named Queen Bee watch for her moving crying scene early on in the wardens office With a filming style thatÕs a cross between a porno movieDawn of The Dead and Car Wash you cannot go wrong This is one to watch over and over againÉafter you put the kids to bed
1,Being from eastern PA right on the border of Northern New Jersey I still get a feeling like this was a documentary more so than a movie I have friends from New York and New Jersey and this film represents the kind of lifestyle that still exists today in lower income areas outside of the Big City lifestyle If you have not seen this movie and ever wondered what REALLY goes on in the urban jungle check this movie out No really big name actors its as if they just pulled these guys off the street and said act which adds to the realism of the movie the performances are FANTASTIC none the less SEE THIS FILM
1,and my reasons for which are simple there are so many great films presented and discussed here most of them by their own directors and stars so many clips of infamous moments in 70s movie history and in fact a number of films I have yet to see that it wouldnt be fair to grade this work By this logic I shouldnt have given grades to other movie documentaries like Martin Scorseses Personal Journey through American Movies and My Voyage to Italy But while those films were on the basis of one mans view of cinema narrating through most of the way Richard LaGravanese and the late Ted Demmes A Decade Under the Influence lets the films and the creators speak entirely for themselves  What makes Decade worth at least one watch for film buffs or just anyone who likes the films of the late 60s70s in America are the levels that it goes to that in the uncut version three hours not the theatrical version which I have no comment on plenty of ground is covered Interviews include the likes of Scorsese Robert Altman Sidney Lumet Julie Christie Jon Voight Francis Ford Coppola Paul Schrader Pam Grier Bruce Dern Peter Bogdanovich Roger Corman Dennis Hopper Robert Towne etc and theres a constant flow of insight from start to finish The way the clips and directorsactors pop up edited together in a flashy and quick style is also fascinating  The one down comment I have on the documentary is that most of the information presented has been reported on in various books like Easy Riders Raging Bulls and though I havent seen the movie version of that book yet Im sure it would have covered many of the films and directors and incidents as here in fact the book of that is one of the best Ive ever read HOWEVER this documentary serves as something special for film buffs and occasional movie goers of the future they can look at this and learn not only about such well known pictures as Easy Rider The Last Picture Show Annie Hall Coming Home and lessor knowns like Scarecrow Panic in Needle Park The Landlord Joe They Shoot Horses Dont They They can also learn about who influenced them new waves of Europe and Asia who they served as influences for and how the subject matter that created controversy after controversy still serves as intriguing and chancy material for the contemporary crowd Seek this out
1,The cinematography is the films shining feature Park really knows his stuff when it comes to shooting memorable scenes from behind a camera Every shot is filled with vibrant colors that leap off of the screen Every frame of the film seems to tell a story all on its own I hope theres a Bluray release of this film because it will look fantastic Its rather intriguing to see which elements of the vampire mythology Park used for his vision Sanghyeon has to drink blood to survive and to stay looking flawless has incredible strength and is vulnerable to sunlight He doesnt however have fangs and also has a reflection in the mirror Although Ive never seen the film I couldnt help but feel like this was Chanwook Parks version of Twilight The entire middle portion of the film is devoted to Sanghyeons and TaeJoos love for one another It felt like the adult version of Twilight really Theres a lot of blood nudity sex and even a few obscenities thrown in for good measure Maybe its the ChanWook Park fanboy in me but I honestly feel like I can guarantee that this is the better film of the two The psychological aspect that I love about Parks previous films is in Thirst as well Thats a major factor for me as any film that causes me to think or is unusual in any way winds up becoming a fan favorite The soundtracks to Parks films always seem to fit its respective film like a glove Thirst is no exception While the soundtrack is a bit more subtle this time around it fit the overall atmosphere of the film rather effortlessly The middle portion of the film did seem to drag on longer than everything else in the film Its weird though as the scenes during that time are crucial to the storyline of the film and its hard to imagine Thirst being the same film if any of those scenes were cut Nevertheless it is my one nitpick of the film Chanwook Park bites into the vampire mythology with Thirst and puts his own dark psychological twist on it Parks films always seem to have a specific formula or include most of the following great writing beautiful cinematography a solid cast some sort of psychological twist thatll mess with your head and a memorable ending Thirst delivers on all fronts and will hopefully get more of the attention it deserved during its theatrical run on DVD and eventually Bluray hopefully
1,Im originally from Brazil the sad thing about this movie was the exploitation that was done to that boy They told his life story and he never got one centavo Brazilian cent of that movie Fernando is not the first and will not be the last to go through that life style in Brazil Sad but that is the world we live in Its about making money not saving lives Question is Where is Fernando today Most probably dead We tend to want to live in this Disney filled fantasy bubbled life When someone comes up to the plate to help along comes the higher power and says What do I get from this Wheres my cut  I wish peoples conscience would speak up
1,2005 will go down in DrWho history as its most incredible year Everything seemed to click a firstrate new Doctor and companion big audiences  10 million for the first episode and Christmas special  major awards critical acclaim and those idiots who spent years giggling at the Daleks seeming inability to negotiate stairs were well and truly silenced But then Christopher Eccleston dropped a bombshell quitting after just one series It looked like the honeymoon was over Luckily the public appears to have embraced his successor the excellent David Tennant On top of this the show boasts fine SFX like the spaceship crashing into Big Ben in Aliens Of London and superb story lines such as Tooth  Claw Army Of GhostsDoomsday The new DrWho is basically the same as the old only updated for the 21st century Some fans have accused Russell TDavies of ruining the show They need to remember that there was no show for sixteen years until he came along
1,I viewed The Reader at Sugar which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything and the movie was by far the highlight of the evening The technical elements were well meshed and it was obvious that Duncan Rogers had chosen his designers and crew well But it was the story and its delivery that truly made this short shine Duncan Rogers tight script was just what this evening of shorts needed It neither meandered as several offerings did or preached to us The Reader was simple story telling in its best form well cast by Rogers and beautifully acted Duncan Rogers is obviously a director with the ability to put all the pieces together Im looking forward to his next finished project K
1,Spoilers This review has been edited due to word limit The horror The horror Marlon Brando Apocalypse Now 1979 and Apocalypse Now Redux 2001 The sentence which is as famous as Heres looking at you kid or Are you talkin to me or May the Force be with you or Ill be back means a little more than some oneliners When it is spoken it lingers in the air with an importance and meaning that does not go unnoticed What might drive some viewers nuts is that they may never find an answer to the horror unless they rewatch the film and try to pay close observation to every single frame What exactly does this line of dialogue mean The horror spoken of is the reality of war The reality of moral men being so easily corrupted that they turn on their inborn instincts and kill fellow beings without any sign of guilt When Capt Willard Martin Sheen stands before the dying Col Kurtz Marlon Brando at the end of the film The horrorthe horror is the realization of Willards corruptness He has mercilessly killed a man in cold blood as part of his assignment This isnt a typical Hollywood ending In most cases a character gains something whether it be emotionally physically mentally or all three But Willard both gains and loses He gains the knowledge that he has lost his morals And that is a shocking ending Apocalypse Now is Francis Ford Coppolas tribute to the artistic side of filmmaking This film is wholly different from The Godfather It is hallucinogenic visually dazzling and an ode to the guilty side of human nature At first it seems realistic and then it becomes strange and then symbolic and by the end original in its own unique perspective of the spiritual side of warfare This is not as much a film about the Vietnam War as it is a film about the war within us At first it does appear to be another war film Captain Willard Sheen is assigned by an Army Lieutenant a young Harrison Ford to assassinate a renegade American Colonel named Kurtz Brando who is hiding out somewhere in Vietnam with a hoard of troops who more or less act as his slaves Willard carries out his mission with extreme prejudice heading out on a boat along with four soldiers including the boat captain Chief Albert Hall Chef Frederic Forest and a very young Larry Fishburne who later went on to appear as Morpheus in The Matrix Apocalypse Now is in a many ways a modern update of Homers Odyssey As our main character Willard carries on his journey he meets an array of original and strange characters including Lt Col Kilgore Robert Duvall who has a strange fetish for surfing and a stoned photographer Dennis Hopper whose lively gestures and mannerisms can be compared to those of the very much lesser Jeremy Davies in The Million Dollar Hotel one of the worst films I have ever seen Davies failed to make any connection with an audience Hopper does He is like the poetic vibe between Willard and Kurtz he is like an interpreter going back and forth and speaking in foreign languages In this case he is translating Kurtz to Willard although Im not so sure Kurtz needs a translation of Willard Many films are lucky enough to have one or two memorable scenes or lines Apocalypse Now has many Kilgore descending upon a Vietnam village playing Wagners Ride of the Valkyries remains one of the most remembered scenes in all of film history There is sharpness to it a brutality to it an ironic tone to it and also a sense of playfulness When Kilgore kneels down on that beach and says I love the smell of napalm in the morningit smells like victory we all crack a smile I wont lie to you Apocalypse Now is a strange film It isnt exactly the easiest thing to analyze The end may frustrate some viewers if they dont understand Marlon Brandos significant speeches But what it all comes down to what really matters is that this film is about the dark nature of the human psyche The horror is the realization of war and its effects not the war itself Kurtz says You have a right to kill me But you have no right to judge me Brandos character Kurtz is left to the audience to judge To many naïve viewers he may appear as a crazy loon whose power got to his head But that isnt what Francis Ford Coppola is trying to get across By fighting in Vietnam Kurtz has realized just how great he had it and how bad some others had it By walking through devastated villages he eventually comes to realize that we are the naïve ones living our lives in a fools paradise We are totally naïve to our surroundings and possible misfortunes until they hit By seeing how unlucky some Vietnamese are Kurtz realizes just how easily he could be struck by something Just how easily he could end up like the people around him And he also realizes that the people who did this are people who have abandoned their morals and left them at the door Many people think the horror is one thing It is two For Kurtz the horror is the reality of how naïve he was and the reality of the wars impact upon men And after Willard murders Kurtz and hears Kurtzs dying words he realizes it too He realizes the effects of war To see so many soldiers with no sense of right or wrong makes him realize the horror of what war can do to a man And what it has done to him The horror 55 stars  
1,I cant believe how many excellent actors can be on one show Its the realism and fine acting that makes it look real This has got to be the best comedy ever created to this day and I love Seinfeld and Everyone Loves Ramond It is just fabulous and it seems everyone in my family agrees Thats no isolated opinion of mine The whole world seems to talk about different incidents and they try to reenact them My hat off to the crew Some shows have an actor that makes the whole show This plot comedy has a slew 8 of them  Thats what makes it so amazing Some people pray for Health  Wealth or fame I pray that the show never ends Sicerely John LKHUBBLE2talkamericanet
1,I was in my mid teens when I saw this movie and I was struck by the beauty of the young stars as well as the loving cinematography and the simple sweetness of the story It amazes me to learn that Alvina has recently died that Bury apparently has not worked in the film business for almost 30 years and that both would be in their 50s The Elton John soundtrack is amazingly beautiful and supports the air of protected innocence the characters experience in seclusion I have seen the movie poster billing it as Deux Enfants QuisAiment which apparently means something like Two Children Who Like Each Otherthe English language distributors were wise to abbreviate the title Paul the ignored 15yearold son of an English businessman living in Paris meets Michelle an orphan at the zoo The two take what they intend as a daylong holiday to Michelles late fathers rural cottage but end up staying there for a year isolated from the outside world They fall in love Michelle gets pregnant and they have the baby alone at home After the babys birth the police come to Pauls work place and take him away Blue Lagoon comes to mind as another film that almost captures the theme of innocence protected in an isolated paradise So sad that Friends has never been released on DVD
1,Too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters I had never heard of it when it appeared on cable After the first shock of realizing this is not like any other movie you have seen since Bringing Up Baby you have to let it sweep you along and run with it Not until its over do you realize it covers issues that are not only subtle but significant Alienation denial wishfulfillment for a start Cathy Bates owns this movie shes never been better The whole cast has the feel of the plot and knows what theyre doing without laying on gratuitous hamming except where its called for as with Julie Andrews bits or Jonathan Pryces camp videos If youre not openminded you wont get it See Mark Adnums bizarre review which he devotes to adulation of Stephanie Beacham her career and her brothers OBE for introducing vegetable oil or something to island natives Taking that as a cue I might as well spend time eulogizing Amo Gulinellos stellar cameo as a TV station intern or Jack Noseworthys shower scene So cast aside all previous concepts of film comedy and have a good time I loved it
1,This film is probably Hal Hartleys best one The subject of a unusual originality is treated thats usual with Hal Hartley with great humor This characteristic isnt at all the only quality of this film the fussy frame composition everything is parallel until the smallest details shooting angles lighting giving a more supernatural dimension to these blurred images Jesus coming down couldnt be filmed in a conventional way the falsely poser acting are qualities that make this Bible rereading carried out in the form of an apocalyptic delirium essential
1,Gypsy is possibly the greatest musical ever written so its too bad that its film version was such a disappointment To make up for that we have this remake which if not flawless is an enjoyable and well done adaption of the musical The script is completely accurate all the songs included and the staging remains close to the original Jerome Robbins staging Bette Midler is a deft choice for Rose her singing and personality Mermanesquire and her acting splendid Peter Reigert is a fine Herby if not a great singer and Cynthia Gibb is a straight forward natural Louise In truth a live taping of the 1989 revival with Tyne Daly might have been a better idea if only because Gypsy is simply more exciting on stage But this film is a fine translation of a great musical
1,This Horror movie is definitely one of the best ones I have seen in my life and there are many reasons why The storyline is really good it has lots of action and great horror sequences in it The actors are not very good but there are not that bad but Kane is definitely the best actor in this but he was always a good actor also The cast is very good such as Kane as Jacob Goodnight Christina Vidal as Christine Michael j Pagan as Tye Samantha Noble as Kira etc Also I just have to warn you that the killing scenes are very disturbing but They are very creative but that just makes it better and you cant have a horror movie without blood and gore Also they look very realistic So I am sure that you will not be disappointed with see no evil because it is a really good movie So make sure that you rent or buy see no evil because it is just so great Overall score  out of    out of 
1,Ever since Ive been allowed to play Goldeneye once again its been impossible to get my mind off it Im surprised I could have gone without it It is without a doubt one of the greatest games of all time I have never played any other shooting games but I know that this one rules above all Most people blame it for too much violence but I find that ridiculous There may be a few graphic antics but theres far worse out there Most importantly its fun With an awesome arsenal of weapons such as the RCP90 and the classic Golden Gun youll go through several challenging levels from the movie completing crucial objectives and fending off swarms of guards There are tons of awesome cheats to get and even two secret levels that you will only earn if you have the true skill Goldeneye is also one of the greatest multiplayer games ever as well You can choose several characters from the movie classic villains from old 007 movies Baron Samedi Oddjob May Day and Jaws and guards in the game Chances are you and your partners will be laughing so hard as you blow each other away that youll look like Bart and Lisa Simpson watching an episode of the Itchy and Scratchy show  So if you dont have the game dont rent it Just buy it Its too good to be true For cool Goldeneye stuff check out Detstarcoms Goldeneye website Every James Bond lover will dig this game big time
1,I saw this film many years ago along with another of Shepitkos films Wings as part of a Soviet film series at a local film archive But none of Shepitkos films as far as I can tell have ever made it to video or DVD in the United States Ascent is a great film by any standard with stunning black and white photography hypnotic direction and actors so deep into their roles that you have no sense of them merely giving a performance Although the period details of Russian resistance to and collaboration with German occupation are very telling the story is timeless Two Russian partisans are captured by the Germans and the interrogation tests their integrity as well as their courage I suspect the reason why it has not been released on DVD by the Russians here comes the spoiler is that the Jewish intellectual and not the tough Russian peasant is the partisan who resists both threats and temptation goes serenely to his death and sets an heroic example for the villagers
1,No I have not seen the original series and I wont compare the two if I had This series is filmed in Canada in Vancouver and Victoria British Columbia The series is wellwritten in a different story each week Some are little out there but most of the time it is the quality of the story telling I loved the Afterlife episode with Clancy Brown and Barbara Gerrick and the Deprogrammers episode with the irresistible Brent Spiner as a Deprogrammer in a world where humans have become slaves to a lizard reptilian species Its funny how the lizards and reptiles are our favorite evil aliens like V but anyway he has three days to program a man who is totally brainwashed in serving the alien species on earth The stories are usually a little out there but very entertaining to watch
1,WOW Talk about a film that divides the audience This is a real love it or loath it kinda movie Personally I really enjoyed it I noticed that other reviews are comparing it to Pitch Black  this is kinda dumb as the only thing they have in common is SAND People can be real stupid No this film is far more in common with The Thing how people fail to notice is amazing  they even have the same basic music Lots of Carpenter touches are there blue collar heroes sharp humor endless rolling landscapes full of death and things not understood Perhaps what stops this film being a real classic is its deference to other Carpenter works Not least Dark Star which it has something in common with Id be interested to know how much it REALLY cost 8000 Is that even possible Maybe it was based on a short film that cost 8000 But I did find myself strangely moved when the various space dudes died They are so underplayed that its like watching a documentary at times Having said that the script is kinda clunky and only about half of them can act however and Im not sure the big guy playing the Captain is one of them But his gun is AWESOME Give it a chance if you like early Carpenter you might fall for it just dont expect 2001
1,I LOVE Dr WHo SO much I believe that David Tennant is the best Dr the show has ever had and Billie Piper the Best companion I liked the way the Dr and Rose had such a connection and a great relationship and the Dr came close a few times to expressing his love for rose It sadly came to an end after only 2 seasons I will miss watching rose heaps and think that the show will not be the same without Rose But David is still there to make me laugh and make me happy to watch him play this fantastic role I rate this show 110 it is FANTASTIC The graphics and monsters in this show are wonderful and every storyline is different but somewhat connected and i have actually learned somethings about love the world and relationships from this show Therefore it must be one of the most fantastic shows of all time
1,A wonderful Christmas story on the moving theme of Susie Homemaker finds her Inner Amazon No Im serious Geena Daviss amnesia starts to improve when she is knocked on the head From this familiar beginning we move in an unexpected direction Good pace good action fun story lots of explosions and mayhem
1,This film is not really a remake of the 1949 OBrien film which is excellent It borrows the main premisea man has been poisoned and spends the rest of the film trying to find his killer But I like that the writers chose an English professor instead of a private dick as the protagonist The plot is also quite original In general the film moves along fast enough to keep you awake But what mars this film is a strange dated quality about it probably due to the horrendous 80s original music scorecombined with an affected noir feel Dennis Quaid grins inexplicably throughout the whole film at odd moments but hes still compelling in a general way Meg Ryan is fine as the student helperlove interest When the film gets sort of bad is when Dex the prof meets the British bodyguardchauffeur and their duels are pretty laughable The bodyguard works for the rich widow played by lovely Charlotte Rampling but those scenes are too selfconsciously noir to help the film along even though the family plot line is rather interesting Dex also keeps showing up at the same place and finding this bodyguard which is rather coincidental In the latter part of the filma man is shot by a window and from the outside you see him jump out of itthat was pretty bad direction But aside from some of these obvious flaws I think it still holds OK I certainly didnt predict the ending so that was goodthere is a twist and although some posters here think they were misled I thought it was a fine and believable ending Dennis Quaid with his weird smirks and black eyes is more likable in The Right Stuff Great Balls of Fire Inner Space and Cold Creek Manor But here as Dex hes supposed to be somewhat of a jerk so he did fine Fairly decent movie
1,First time I ever saw this was at a friends house It ended up in his parents hands by a fluke some videostorebicycle repair shop went bankrupt and treats like this was up for grabs We saw it two times in a row and almost wet are pants how hard we laughed  Ive seen historical documents like Ninja Mission and Plan 9 from Outer Space and they still remain good runnersup in comparison to this one  Almost 15 years after first contact it is now considered the best cult movie of all times in my circles Ive showed it to all my friends We now have a tradition of searching for movies in the same category the unrateable one It cant be explained or reviewed in any normal way because every scene every take every move contains at least one mistake regarding editing dialouge directing etc For any cultmovie buff this is the ultimate prize the gem of all gems Raiting As for craft it cant be rated because it would even be an insult to homemade videos of birthdays and weddings As for pure amusement it is the funniest movie I have ever seen funnier than any comedy ever made past or present Anything less than a 1010 should be regarded as an insult to good sense of hum our
1,For those with access to the BBC or the CBC this has proved to be spectacular Like Battlestar Gallactica this is a show rebuilt from the ground up But in the case of Dr Who they saved the best parts I cant believe I am saying this but this is by far the best Dr Who This has none of the cheap production values and sometimes slow plodding of the old show The acting is quite good and there is a real sense of continuity and history The new Doctor is easily the equal of the great Tom Baker and the writer former QAF lead seems to have made even the minor characters come alive I knowIm gushingbut this should be on everyone scifi geeks list I just dont know why it hasnt made its way here Whatever you doif you ever loved Dr Who or scifisee this
1,This is a funny movie The Bob  Eddie Show feel of it could lead to a sequel but I doubt it will make enough money  Deniro proves he can be a great Straight man again with some hilarious and spontaneous moments Eddie was fun to watch working with people instead of CGI animals and rodents Rene Russo well shes just fun to watch anyway and shes played her part excellent Some wild and unusual stunts especially the garbage truck scene This was worth seeing in the theater We needed a good laugh and got many from the movie and the great outtakes at the end DO NOT LEAVE at the start of the credits At least a 7
1,Joline Heather Graham married Carl Luke Wilson and about five hundred and some days later Carl is very depressed and leaves her expecting to clean the fog in their lives Joline faces her marriage as an important commitment to the end of her life and decides to look for Carl in Texas She is very supported by her brother Jay Casey Affleck who meets her in the border of Mexico There Joline meets the confused Carl and realizes that she can not change his decision while Jay knows Carmen Patricia Velasquez and starts dating her and in the end life goes on This movie is very unpredictable having a very different story I believe it is an independent production In some parts it is a little slow and boring but there are certain dialogs that makes this movie worthwhile I liked it and my vote is seven Title Brazil Rebeldes Até o Fim Rebels Until the End 
1,As far as I am concerned this film noir had two totally different things going for it as opposed to the film noirs I am used to viewing 1  the setting is Paris France 2  there is 28minute scene with no dialog Both make this movie a bit unique at least to Englishspeaking film noir fans Actually an American Jules Dussain shot the film so its not entirely a European film Initially I was disappointed in this after I had watched the first 40 minutes Its an expensive DVD and I was bored However once that silent segment started  the actual heist you already know whats it about the film picked up considerably and just got better and better In fact I thought the best part of the story was what happened after the heist The best aspect of the entire film was the cinematography This is what makes the disc worth owning Its excellent film noir photography and a real travelogue for those of us who have never seen Parisand this is Paris in the mid 1950s There are lots of bleakbutinteresting rainsoaked Paris streets and buildings I found fascinating to view In fact there were many more of those great shots than of London in the much better known film The Third Man The lead actor in here Jean Servais I think his name is also is interesting to view Someone described his face as a cross between Humphrey Bogart and Harry Dean Stanton and that sums it up perfectly A warning for those not expecting profanity or nudity in a classic film This is France not the United States so there is a little bit of both in here I appreciate the DVD offering the choice of subtitles or a dubbed version too
1,The three main characters are all hopeless and yet you only feel sorry for one of them Ernesto hopelessly devoted to Mercedes This was part of the frustration screaming at Mercedes to get a clue and ditch the nogood Harry to no avail Then theres the satisfaction Steve Buscemi has a great part as a transvestite and Harvey Keitels moving story of his indignity playing a gorilla for a cheap TV movie is incredible When you least expect it Quentin Tarintino is doing half a monologue and Anthony Quinn turns Ernesto into a wealthy man Time and again great moments appear in the story but in the end its hard to know what to feel about this movie It doesnt have a happy ending or even a complete one but it somehow feels right This movie is strange but then so am I no wonder I liked it
1,One of the best horrorsuspense movies I have seen in a long time Wow it was a big surprise and stunning at how good this movie was sometimes a gem like this will surface but is rare I expected a popcorn monster flick and a mildly diverting way to spend a late night but instead a very well made and directed movie with great acting and made with passion and heart  This is a movie that makes you feel for the characters and what happens to them and it is filmed like you are there and it is really happening I know some people in other reviews compare it to Open Water but I disagree because I thought Open Water was quite boring and mediocre while this movie was the opposite although superficially they are filmed in the same realistic style The actors are unknowns at least to me but they all are very effective and convey the dire situation with frightening intensity and realism The story is well done and flows smoothly the plot is logical and appears to be something that could happen all the actions and thoughts of the characters are quite what a person would do and think about Very believable and this makes the movie more real because of it I had tears in my eyes at the end I must say a movie seldom has this effect on me this is how powerful and emotional this movie was done and I am suitably impressed by the director and actors of this great movie
1,Warning Slight Plot Spoilers Ahead The Italian Job is not the best movie youll see all year or probably even this summer But it is a worthwhile two hours because it colors within the lines knowing its limits and not attempting to exceed them What carries the movie is the work of the cast In a movie about a crew of thieves the individuals must have a good rapport with each other Without that cohesive feel the audience doesnt believe in the characters collectively or individually and the movie never has a chance But from the first scenes in which the men joke around and rag on each other while infiltrating a Venetian palace the proper chemistry is in place The characters themselves arent anything novel theyre your basic gang of criminals containing about half a dozen players each with a specific and defining skill But each actor brings the proper goods to the table for his or her part Mark Wahlbergs understated acting and humor fits well with his part as the mastermind planner Edward Norton provides attitude and twirls his mustache well in his dark role Donald Sutherland is the father figure of the crew and he looks the part of the suave and oldfashioned thief who is still mentally spry Jason Statham Seth Green and Mos Def dont do much beyond their characters abilities but they each nail those parts Statham as the smoothoperating driver Green as the tech whiz geek with a chip on his shoulder and Def as the demolitions man Charlize Theron slides in well in a part that doesnt ask too much of her She is primarily asked to to drive fast and look good That she does None of the characters are that deep or threedimensional but in this familiar sort of movie two dimensions are all that is required  As the title implies the movie has a European feel to it a la The Bourne Identity in part because it was shot on location in Venice along with Philadelphia and Los Angeles Also contributing to the Euro flair is the rhythmic bouncy music which adds to the upbeat nature of the flick and complements the rapport of the cast The look of the movie is also a perfect match The bright colors of all locales enhance the mood and add to the attitude The Minis not only provide a fun variation on the car chase but also work as a necessary plot device  The plot is more or less straightforward There are a few surprises but they are more of the swiftandsmoothturn variety as opposed to the dropyourjaw hairpin curve Even with those the movie speeds along Once the foundation is laid by the first act everything continuously progresses Thankfully there are no breaks in the action for a romance something the movie wisely avoided There arent even any breaks for real life The story has its purpose and runs that course without distractions The lack of character depth prevents The Italian Job from being more than a good popcorn movie but with all the complex details of the heistplanning such superfluities would have dragged down the pace and quality of the flick There are a number of implausibilities that I thought of both during and after viewing But the movie is so enjoyable that I didnt and dont care In the real world most of the movie probably couldnt have gone off that cleanly But The Italian Job doesnt take place in the real world It occurs in a stylish and lighthearted criminal world that appeals to the rebel in all of us  The Italian Job is a movie in the true sense of the word It has no pretenses of Oscar and contains no deep moral message It provides pure escapism entertainment and does so quite well Bottom Line Maybe the best popcorn movie of the year so far 7 of 10
1,Gilles Mamouni is playing with the audience with the story of Max Vincent Cassel in search of his biggest lost love Monica Bellucci just before to get engaged to another woman Mamouni uses many flashbacks sequences without warning so the best way to know where we are in the story is to watch for the actors haircut Oherwise it can get very confusing Still a strong film debut for Mamouni beautifully photographed by Thierry Arbogast the 5th element the Messenger and Monica Bellucci is a darling to watch  I felt a little disappointed near the end so I gave it 9 out of 10
1,At 237pm in a bathroom at an Adelaide highschool a student takes their own life and the different worlds of six teenagers are changed forever 237 is a brutal honest and breathtaking film centered on the pain of being a teenager The film follows one day in the lives of six teenagers all intertwined all dealing with their own personal dramas While there are a couple of stereotypes in the mix  the beautiful wouldbe popular girl dealing with body issues the overachiever obsessed with his grades there are several horrors that are as far from mainstream as you can get including a social outcast dealing with a brutal illness and a young girl trying to make sense of a devastating event in her past The movie is mixed with documentarystyle interviews from the characters which some viewers may find a little out of place in the otherwise seamless narrative The pace is also a little slow but it fits with the feel of the movie The young Australian actors are all stars in their own right in particular Theresa Palmer whos heartbreaking performance earned her an AFI nomination The film is very well shot with terrific direction Some scenes are a little hard to watch  in particular the fiveminutelong suicide scene but overall it is a film that leaves a big impact on its viewers It draws you in right from its shocking opening scene and keeps you guessing as to which of the six main characters is going to be the one to end up in the bathroom Ultimately its a beautiful made but slightly disturbing look at teenage life
1,True Love I truly enjoyed and LOVED this movie It was fun funny and inspirational I just saw it on DVD How did I miss this one its a winner I mean Flex was That Guy I wanted to marry him This was my 1st time seeing him as a straight leading man and he pulls it off I thought Tangi Miller was the best ever and I was a Felicity head too A fearless woman who only fears her Nana Thank You for giving women of color range in your work and she looks great Tasha Smith was a Blast Aloma Wright was priceless as Nana This cute romantic comedy is A Must See Oh and the new comer Marcus Patrick is worth the surprise ladiesTrue Love Karen
1,It starts a little slow but give it a chance In the spirit of the Wackiest Ship in the Arm and the Pink Sub this movie is about a not so orthodox group engaged in not so orthodox methods to outwit everyone Rob Schneider is priceless as a LT that takes himself way too seriously which results in a failed mutiny attempt and pirate crew makes him walk the plank In contrast Kelsey Grammarsimilar to Cary Grantdoes not take anything to serious except the job This movie is more about lines than plot From the beered up fisherman in Charleston harbor to the whale decoy their antics took me by surprise and I laughed out loud
1,I dont skateboard because I think its gay but this game is really great its smooth fast easy to play and just fun even if you dont do so well It can be just really fun to make the skaters just crash and burn easily one of the best video games ever
1,The End of Suburbia neatly collects many of the concerns with the coming Peak of the worlds oil supply As the world population grows so does demand for oil and power As we extract oil and power we come to a peak in production More oil is demanded less oil is generated The inevitable outcome is conflict and major change  This film will be disturbing and alarming if youre new to the topic You may react at first with anger and denial because the implications are so grim It should be required viewing Beyond politics beyond optimism the math is undeniable  Suburbia is the focus because our suburban living areas will be the communities most impacted when the price of energy skyrockets While intuitive logic would tell you that the big cities will be the places to avoid during a time of crisis the spread out nature of suburbia will make it difficult if not impossible to maintain an efficient community without our vehicles to transport us  Peak oil is no longer a topic for discussion by survivalists and backwoods crazies This issue will be at our doorstep sooner than we think This film is a lucid coherent look at it
1,Stewarts age didnt bother me at all in this movie although he was portraying a much younger person I still recall my fascination with Lindberghs story and while I was thoroughly adult by the time this biopic was made I had to see it Not only does this boast a great performance by Stewartit also gives a lot of fascinating technical datamaking it understandable to those technically challenged such as myself And the look of the plane itself was great I quite loved this depiction of a period before my birth and reawakens the childhood love I had for airplanes and for the idea of air travel
1,Fast Times it aint But check this movie out it has a heart Pour yourself a drink and enjoy Its loaded with a slew of justbeginning stars Sherilyn Fenn has her first onscreen credited cameo Chris Penn Lea Thompson Eric Stotz Jenny Wright Rick Moranis etcthey all look so young Oh and if you look closely the cops wife is Nancy Wilson from the rock band Heart
1,Only the Valiant qualifies as a gritty good western This Gregory Peck cavalry versus the Indians oater is a solemn suicide mission without a trace of humor Veteran director Gordon Douglas has helmed a grim harrowing outdoors epic with an ideal cast of tough guys under considerable pressure even Lon Chaney Jr registers superbly as a powerful Arab trooper Ostensibly Colorado Territory scenarist Edmund H North  A Place in the Sun scribe Harry Brown drew their screenplay from western film maker Charles Marquis Warrens taut novel about a group of diehard cavalrymen cut off from any escape route who must prevent murderous redskins from launching a devastating raid against helpless white settlers North and Brown stick to Warrens novel for the most part and the last minute revelationwhen it seems that there is no way that our heroes can survive another onslaught of Native Americansis a corker This turnofthecentury tale develops an effective claustrophobic feeling in the second half of the action Douglas and company take studio bound sets and make them look convincing during the nocturnal hours The crisp black  white photography of Going My Way cinematographer Lionel Linden imbues this western a grim look that accentuates its tension and atmosphere Actor Michael Ansara who later played the chief villain in Guns of the Magnificent Seven is extremely effective in a small role as the hated Indian leader Tucsos Only the Valiant opens with overvoice narration by Army Scout Joe Harmony This is my stamping ground Im a scout for the Army Had my work cut out for me for a long time Behind that pass there is the whole Pache nation There is a graphic of the territory with the Flinthead Mountains stretching across the screen with a bottleneck pass They used to come swarming out of the pass killing everything in sights Then we built a fortFort Invincible It plugged up the pass just like a cork in a bottle Things was fine for a while But them Paches is pretty smart One day the bottle blew the cork plum apart We are shown the burning remains of Fort Invincible with a dead man pinned to a stockade wall and a lance sticking out of his belly Captain Richard Lance Gregory Peck of 12 OClock High and his men boil in on horseback and capture Tucsos Michael Ansara and Joe Harmony Jeff Corey of True Grit wants to shoot him on the spot Harmony points out Tucsos is the fella that started this whole business Captain Lance intervenes The Army doesnt shoot prisoners Joe Predictably Harmony is aghast at this prospect Hes no common injun Hes just as near to a god as a fella can get If you shoot him now things will quiet down Without Tucsos stirring them up the rest of those Indians will get reasonable just as fast as they can You take him in alive youll have every Pache in the territory coming after him We have had three years of this you can stop it now Just as predictably Captain Lance refuses to kill Tucsos and Lances decision to take the Indian back sets things into action Colonel Drum Herbert Heyes of Union Station surprises Lance when he tells him he should have shot Tucsos As it is they need to get Tucsos to another post Everybody from the troopers to Joe Harmony knows that taking Tucsos to Fort Grant is asking to die The Apaches are poised in the mountains and the fort is under strength Meantime we are introduced to the daughter of Captain Eversham Cathy Eversham Barbara Payton of Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye and young Lieutenant William Holloway Gig Young of They Shoot Horses Dont They and they play a part in a major narrative complication You see Lance and Holloway both want to marry Cathy Clearly Cathy wants Lance Colonel Drum refuses to let Lance take Tucsos to Fort Grant because Drum cannot spare Lance Drum changes the orders and Holloway is given the mission at the last minute and everybody is shocked Lance has never changed an order Furthermore Lance saw Cathy and Holloway kissing in public and everybody thinks Lance has reassigned Holloway out of jealousy Indeed one officer observes that rewriting orders is about a possible as rewriting the Bible Predictably Tucsos escapes and the surviving troopers and Harmony bring back a dead Holloway Although Drum expects a relief column of 400 troopers to arrive any day Harmony points out to Lance that Tucsos will attack Tucsos has seen the fort and knows their lack of strength Lance requests to take 6 or 7 men of his choosing to man Fort Invincible and prevent Tucsos from assembling a war party The bottleneck in the mountains keeps the Indians from riding through in strength instead they must come through oneatatime Lance believes his men can thwart them until the relief column arrives Drum gives him permission and Lance picks the worst men All of them hate him and would willingly kill him Only the Valiant exemplifies the new breed of military western after World War II This is not a gungho John Ford cavalry western Indeed Lances own men want to kill him and this foreshadows the attitude of troops during the Vietnam War when they fragged their own officers Lance bears the onus of allexcept the few who know about the circumstances that brought about the change of orders putting Holloway in charge of the detail The black  white photography enhances the dire nature of this western Only the Valiant amounts to a last stand western until the last minute reprieve Reportedly Peck hated this movie but then this is not a spitandpolish western in Technicolor If anything Only the Valiant lives up to its Warner Brothers origins It is small but significant and it is grubby with loads of drama and unsavory characters virtually a Dirty Dozen western
1,The Deer Hunters success with critics and publics alike led United Artists to give Cimino carteblanche on Heavens Gate an epic Western about the 1892 Johnson County Wars  The elliptical story about the persecution of lowly Europeanborn farmers by Wyomings cattlebarons was a muddled mixture of classconflict sumptuous pageant and underwritten stereotypical characters However Ciminos fetish for authenticity and his sweeping sense of scale ensured that the film running at nearly four hours  was rarely tedious  Its undeserved status as a cause célébre with critics divided as to whether it was a masterpiece or a fiasco derived from its inflated budget Blamed for the studios financial problems Cimino became a scapegoat for Hollywoods general decline and the film edited into an incomprehensible short version after its initial release was a commercial disaster
1,One of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film To have it totally wash over you so that you absorb it as it is and thus experience it to the fullest Every time I see it The Egyptian is such a film Over the years it is a picture critics have loved to hate Many have thrown darts at its vulnerabilities But perhaps it is because of the very tone the film brings with it rather than its most obvious characteristics It is at once forbidding remote possibly dangerous beware of what lies within The haunting chords of the music seen over the 20thFox logo usher us into titles of otherworldly turquoise lettering Strange Archaeological Decadent It is as if we are descending into some vault of antiquity wherein might be great treasures mixed with uncertain hazards One might imagine Darryl Zanuck commanding Make it ancient Then what a darkly dramatic story unfolds all within the same tone set at the start Of Hollywoods mid50s Egyptian Trilogy The Ten Commandments portrayed the civilizations sternness the phenomenal Land of the Pharaohs its nuts and bolts while The Egyptian shows it all from glamour to tragedy for us to wonder at No need to say much about the players here but I think that with the passage of time Bella Darvi is being redeemed What a perfect face for the role right out of a Symbolist painting If her acting does not please some it might be argued that in her role as a courtesan she is obviously better in bed than yakking to some poor helpless admirer I think that Curtiz captured the kinkiness of her sadomasochistic relationship with Edmund Purdoms character with aplomb censorship being what it was at the time Sir Peter Ustinov in his memoirs was pretty kind to The Egyptian writing that it was like being lost in a huge set for Aida His pronunciation of the word beer I have adopted myself ever afterOne of the films historically accurate references the Egyptians invented beer Henry Daniell egads what a perfect performance Gene Tierney what a screen treasure Bless DFZ for giving her this late role Cmon folks dont be so hard on Victor Mature Hes a cheesemakers son Who rose to be pharaoh Sounds like a peculiarly American opportunity One of the best moments John Carradines existential observations on the sands of time And Purdoms utterance about dwelling beyond the sunset of the world If that isnt Grade A epicness what is Of course along with everything else the music is sublime It is frequently noted that Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann created one of the screens most compelling scores perfectly harmonious yet each theme is well developed with a life of its own Newman pressed for time by DFZ called in Herrmann someone he could trust implicitly to take up half the burden Benny not the easiest guy to work with obviously respected Newman enough to really deliver inspiring music They alternated cues an ingenious approach No spoilers as to who did what here but Benny brings an edge with him mysterious awesome sounds Alfred brings fulsomeness longing poignancy Both are consummately epic Even when seen on a squeezed TV print the effect of seeing the two composers names side by side in the main credits which the ultrawide anamorphic screen could comfortably accommodate is spinetingling Leon Shamroy the Dean of CinemaScope does not let us down here The lurid greens and moody shadows probably distortions in all the terrible TV prints Ive seen through the years perfectly accompany the multidimensional script by the great Philip Dunne and WB vet Casey Robinson whom Curtiz mustve brought with him to 20th How remarkable it is that Shamroy who was as much of an institution of cinematography at Fox as Newman was with music would lens Cleopatra a few years later but in the brighter sharper images of 60s Todd AO These old studio guys are really heroes of mine To me who wants to fret about all the imperfections and criticism opportunities in a picture like this Id rather yield entirely to its spell and dive off into its sea of lavishness to emerge after the inspiring climax of The End refreshed moved and hungry for more And yes we should cry out to 20thFox for a DVD release worthy of DFZs legacy
1,Great Movie The sound track is awesome Very relaxing sound Elton was ahead of his own time even back in 1971 Lewis Gilbert did a magnificent job producing and directing this film The movie was romantic and a breath of fresh air The sound tracks written by Sir Elton complimented the movie to a T Rex Morris does a great job with the tenor sax on the song Honey Roll and poem I Meant To Do My Work Today by Richard Le Gallienne was incredible Kudos to everyone involved with this fantastic film It was no surprise that a lot of the people involved with this movie went on to become the best in their field
1,I would give this television series a 10 plus if i could The writers were smack on and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showThese characters were so real One could tell that from the two main actresses Ms Toussaint  Ms Potts that their relationship on  off camera was genuine It didnt just end when you hear those familiar words Cut at the end of a Take The show has thought me a lot about life for eg Historical struggles tragedies and triumphsrelationshipsevery day situations every household have same situations no matter who the members are it really came down to just being a wonderful family show that at the end of every episode you can just sit on your living room couch and say to yourself now what did i learn from this particular episode I must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again Now you know why I gave it a 10
1,Theres not much anyone can say about this flickthe plot is quite simple Two police officers who also happen to be lovers are using a brothel as a stakeout in order to catch a criminal with the help of the lady of the house played by hardcore pornstar Chloe As anyone can guess theres a few plot twists and some blurred alliances but the writing was just horrible even for a softcore movie Ive read some previous posts about Nicole Hilbigs accent she plays the female cop Yes its hard to understand what shes saying at times but I think Ive placed it I did some sniffing aroundI think shes from Germany hence her oddsounding accent She makes an impression even without speaking howevershes got a great looking body There were a couple of from behind sex scenes in this movie that were quite graphic for a softcore filmexcellent work there The threeway scene toward the end wasnt bad either SPOILER ALERT I kinda knew the female cop was gonna turn into a parttime call girl at the end She enjoyed her threeway WAY too much END SPOILER Im not gonna nitpick about the story TOO much seeing as this is a lowbudget directtovideo softcore flick However it just seems like Ive seen way too many movies in this genre with a similar type of storyline Women B Chloe and Hilbig were okay as the eyecandy Sex B scenes were kinda short but good Story C a recycled plot but whatever works eh Overall B
1,A suprisingly good film considering the circumstances of its production Features performances from noname actors that rival the top talent on the planet sadly none have persued a career  Also features the the godlike ability of Christopher Nolan to write perfect dialogue Dialogue is what carries this story which is about a man who likes to follow people for material for his books Well shot VERY well edited even better written and amazingly well performed This movie has everything a great film needs except people who have seen it 910
1,It was a sweet intro for the most intelegent Sailor Soldier Sailor Mercury It consisted with a new in croud Merciurios He at the beganing wrote a love letter to Ami which would be starltling of course and now Ami thiks he is a chibiEinstien and he is attractive He ended up looking like Umino Melvin This was a halarios expesialy Minakos Its no skin off my neck scene HOT Well I really like the Bishojo Senshi Sailor Moon Series I personally think its the best anime ever But this movie was nice funny but not as adventurios as Sailor Moon R It was more like the S movie I saw this  Sailor Moon Univewrse with real Player and it was pretty good Over all
1,I love horror films but I think they work way better when they hide a dramatic impact behind The Devils Backbone The Exorcist for example This is that kind of film and its not only eerie and terrifying when it has to be it is also really beautiful A Tale of Two Sisters starts really slow so if youre in a hurry to see ghosts in the first 20 minutes you will be disappointed Actually this is not a ghost story though there are some Its something more complex and its done in such a way that it beats Ringu and The Grudge out of the ring no sweat A Tale is a way more clever film than those huge cultural hits because it really cares for its characters and the direction is flawless Every detail in this film will leave you breathless if youre the kind of person who loves to pay attention to details while watching a movie The acting is superb specially from the stepmother and the main girl Those two are worth the price of the ticket alone Do yourself a favor and watch this awesome film
1,Im sure the film contains certain gaps in logic but I was so enthralled by it that I really didnt care The movie plays out like a fun lighthearted teen romp combined with a Schwarzeneggertype action flick Its packed with action packed with excitement and has some humorous moments as well Sean Astin is fun to watch and I havent seen Louis Gossett Jr since I saw Diggstown in theaters He is a fine underrated actor and I love watching him on screen I just wonder what hes doing now Unfortunately he might be starring in a lot of those directtovideo flicks Hopefully my assumption is wrong Anyway this is a fun edgeofyourseat thriller and I definitely suggest you check it out  My score 7 out of 10
1,Some critics have compared Chop Shop with the theatrical releases of City of God and Pixote Ive seen both of those as well as Chop Shop and like in many instances I dont feel the comparison is warranted City of God and Pixote surely had a much higher budget Chop Shop is a low budget independent film about survival and hope disappointment and continuing with life One of the scenes is allegedly filmed during the US Open and either the filmmakers had incredible connections or the scene was filmed at another time and the US open footage was added I say that because I live in the area where this movie was filmed and security is insane while the tennis matches are in progress Its also noteworthy that the actors actual names were their characters names in the movie Back to the movie Its an enjoyable story about survival However it ended up getting a 7 because at times the actors acted extremely well At other times they appeared to be just reciting their lines If the actors were less competent as they were in the low budget The Big Dis for example I would have been more forgiving But in several scenes each and every one of these actors gave exemplary performances At other times they appeared bored The director might be at fault here I also had problems with the ending This is one of those movies that just ends Maybe there will be a part 2 Definitely worth getting on DVD I wont bother summing up the story because that info is already available on IMDb
1,A new and innovative show with a great cast that keeps you on the edge of your seat Lake Bell is wonderfulit is to bad that her other show Miss Match was canceled I am just glad she came back on Surface I cant wait for the return of Surface This show is really something unique to watch With an eerie underwater world that is akin to Jurassic Park this show keeps you wondering what is next Nim is adorable even if he is going to turn into something larger and much more ominous There are so many generic shows out there that just seem to rehash the same old subjects When something like Surface comes along you just have to say THANK YOU
1,Read This BOYZ N THE HOOD IS A SCENEBYSCENE COMPLETE RIPOFF OF THIS MOVIE Two friends in the hood ones focused on intellectual pursuits and the other is an athlete The friend whos an athlete gets involved with the wrong people and gets killed The athlete just happens to be Washington from Welcome Back Kotter It makes me mad that people dont know this It blows my mind everytime I go into a video store and Boyz n the Hood is in the Drama section while Cooley High is in Comedy Its an embarrassing disgrace This movie is both funnier and more dramatic than John Singletons ripoff At least Singleton could have had the dignity to speak out that his film was homage to Cooley High but no he never said a word Boys 2 Men however named their hit record after this film

1,This film held my interest enough to watch it several times The plot has holes but the lead performers make it work Catherine Mary Stewart Julia Kerbridge does a great job as a woman of 37 who has sacrificed everything else to become a physician She worked years to earn the money to go to medical school She is performing brilliantly in her residency and is just about to take her board exam and realize her dream Meanwhile Julias sister and brotherinlaw are murdered and as the nearest living relative she is compelled to take in her niece Amanda Arlen AguayoStewart to avoid having her become a ward of the state Amanda is about 7 years old from her appearance Amanda is so traumatized from her parents murder that she has become mute Needless to say Julias 16hour days get longer caring for Amanda Rob Lowe plays Kevin Finney a charming neighbor man in their apartment building who works his way into the lives of Julia and Amanda He is always there with a trick or a joke to help Amanda deal with her distress Amanda really starts to warm up to Kevin as the film progresses perhaps more than to her aunt Julia starts to rely on Kevin to take some of the load of caring for Amanda as she attempts to handle her case load and prepare for her board examination Kevin is always there whenever some crisis erupts for Julia The chemistry between Rob and Catherine Mary was great You keep watching to see them get together before the end of the film The chemistry between Rob and Arlen was good as well Arlen managed to convey quite a lot without the benefit of words The plot had Julia and Amanda gradually warming up to each other You can see them working out a relationship as the film progresses We discover that Julias sister and brotherinlaw the Meyers were involved in industrial espionage They stole an extremely valuable prototype microchip from their employer They had three associates who intended to share the proceeds of the theft Julia discovers that the Meyers were planning to skip the country under assumed identities The plot is unclear whether the Meyers intended to double cross their associates or were themselves double crossed In any case the Meyers are murdered in their home by 2 of their former associates The killers make no attempt to extract the location of the microchip from the Meyers before killing them The killers search the home and fail to find their prize They leave a living witness to their crime Amanda The killers then spend the remainder of the film making clumsy attempts to extract the microchip from Julia and Amanda who have no idea where the prize is located Eventually the killers kidnap Amanda in hopes she knows something about the microchips location Eventually Julia discovers the truth about Kevin He is an investigator hired to recover the stolen microchip After some rough moments in the relationship they manage to rescue Amanda and dispatch the bad guys The predictable ending has the three forming a family and moving happily into a future together What struck me about the plot were major holes Kevin moves into the same apartment building as Julia and Amanda the day after the murder of the Meyers How does he know that the microchip is not already in the hands of the killers The killers blithely leave fingerprints at the murder scene with no concern for concealing their identity The killer that pretends to be a psychiatrist is revealed to Amanda by the remnants of red paint from the murder scene on his shoe soles He was not shown in the murder scene at the start of the film There are other weaknesses along these lines too numerous to mention The film could have been a lot better if the script had been refined more before filming Filling in the plot holes would have added little expense and greatly improved the effort
1,I absolutely adored this movie For me the best reason to see it is how stark a contrast it is from legal dramas like Boston Legal or Ally McBeal or even LA Law This is REALITY The law is not BS won in some closing argument or through some ridiculous defense you pull out of your butt like the Chewbacca defense on South Park This is a real travesty of justice the legal system gone horribly wrong and the work by GOOD lawyers  not the shyster stereotype who use all of their skills to right it It will do more for restoring your faith in humanity than any Frank Capra movie or TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD And most importantly I wept During the film during the featurette included at the end of the DVD  its amazing Wonderful film wonderfully made Thank God the filmmakers made it
1,Great British director Christopher Nolan Momento Insomnia directs this odd film about a struggling writer obsessed with following people This proves harmless at first but soon turns dangerous after taking the game a step further after meeting a likeminded man who shows him the ins and outs of breaking and entering The two men soon get in over their heads in a strange world involving the mafia and prostitution Jeremy Theobald plays the writer and Alex Haw the likeminded friend Both are great performances This low budget movie was shot total guerrillastyle with no permits for any locations and no big stars but has what a lot of huge budget films dont have which is a clever script and creative direction An impressive debut by one of todays best directors Good Stuff
1,I am not a fan of musicals but I am a huge fan of Jean Renoir and Jean Gabin I rented this movie on a whim and was pleasantly surprised even expecting greatness from the classic director This movie is BEAUTIFUL The shots are like oil paintings with motion something a lot of directors strive for but Renoir MASTERS I cannot express how much this movie transcends itself its not really a musical it just has a couple of wellplaced musical numbers and a grand dancing finale But there is something about this movie in particular which makes you feel absolute JOY when watching it I am a fan of foreign art films but Im also a meathead who loves things like Die Hard and Schwarzenegger movies I get very easily turned off by things that are overly happy or in la la land but this movie has an overwhelming positive energy that is just irresistible  not to mention every frame is gorgeous and the plot is good 10 out of 10
1,I saw it last week and the sketch about the Korea towns was funny  Very tongue in cheek and suitable to the political climate Full points to the writers and Spike for that The part where he makes the translator pull a rickshaw and throws out Korean words could have been pulled off only by Spike This is a brave attempt by Fox  This is a brilliant show and I hope that it pulls off  My wife and I have been TIVOing it regularly and although it clashes it with a couple of other programs we watch it now on MySpace I hope Fox dedicates full resources to the show and makes it daily I cant wait to see Bobby Lee on his show  With people like Bernard Abedalla behind the show this is on the right track Also Mary Mae as his wife looks beautiful
1,This movie is about six men who are assigned to transport money from bank to businesses Ty Hackett Columbus Short was in Iraq for the war serving his country and now just is being helped out making a living by his friend Mike Cochrone Matt Dillon making sure he does not loose his house Mike tells him that this wasnt the life his parents were expecting for him and he should be living a better life than he is now with his brother Jimmy Hackett Andre Kinney Telling Ty that him and Jimmy have always been family to him and would do anything to help them out Mike tells Ty about a plan to make a heist The money would be around 43 million split six ways among the other transport men too although Ty does not like the idea he tells his friend Mike as long as no one gets hurt he would be in The last night Ty was forced to talk to a welfare lady about putting up his brother in foster care giving him a dilemma to lose what matters most in his life Although the plan sounds safe at first greed isnt everything when it comes to taking lives When it comes to heists your either in or your out so when you dont go with a plan its hard to play the hero and stop greed driven people when it comes to having large sums of money This movie comes with a star studded cast to keep you interested starring Jean Reno Laurence Fishburne Amaury Nolasco Fred Ward Skeet Ulrich and Milo Ventimiglia Short I have recently only remembered him in Stomp the Yard which was about a kid who lost his brother and lives his dream to go to college This was probably one of his best movies I have seen him in and this one he fits the character so well its great to see him on the big screen again in action
1,Due to this show getting cut early I never realized why until I recently read the story behind the series I felt this show never got its dues as one of the greatest shows this show is iconic in nature and deserves the movie it was always intended to have if not with the original A team cast at least with the cast incorporated into the story line or a lengthy cameo perhaps at the end commemorate it to the late Col Hanibal SmithPreppard This cast gave so much to bring happiness to us growing up they deserve one last heave ho the fact that the series ended openly because they slashed the series is reason enough This crew and cast made us realize as children the essence of being one of the good guys especially seeing how screwed up the world is today I think a milder version like the original should be put into motion I have already read the previews and I know these are not the plans but if anything a straight to DVD movie I sure would buy it I really do not get how crappy shows get series finales but this great show which still runs regularly today and probably gets watched more than some of the current garbage shows of today dont we will always remember the Incredible Hulk series Knight Rider Airwolf and the A team because those kind of shows carry through time I am almost positive these knew ones you see about detectives will not even be remembered in 10 years so why not bring back something and show the people what staying power is all about and how these old shows really are all about
1,Beautiful coming of age romance about an English boy and French girl who run off and grow up I saw this movie as a teenager and loved it I saw it again this year and loved again 
1,Dr Paul Flanner Richard Gere a successful surgeon has his wife leave him his son an uncredited James Franco not respect him and looses a patient hes operating on Adrienne Willis Diane Lane has two children and discovers her husband has cheated on her They both need to get away She watches over a beautiful oceanside inn in Rodanthe at the same time he books a room Theyre all alone together You can pretty much figure out the rest This is whats known as a weepie or a womans film Its beautifully shot with a romantic setting and lots of quiet scenes Theres tragedy romance more tragedy and an uplifting ending sort of The great acting by Gere and Lane helps disguise the fact that this film isnt really about much Every single bit of the plot is predictable I rolled my eyes a lot at some of the events Also its far too shortI didnt believe the romance between Gere and Lane for a second If comes out of nowhere and moves VERY quickly Still the movie does work The inn itself is absolutely gorgeous and I was in tears by the end along with most of the audience So its a predictable but gorgeous movie with some wonderful acting It doesnt deserve all the criticism its getting I give it a 7
1,This movie was working toward two goals to make a political point and to tell a scary adventure story Its often difficult to do make a political point and still tell a good story consider the highly political but rarelyentertaining final season of Ellen Beyond Rangoon finds a good balance between politics and storytelling I already knew that Aung San Suu Kyi had won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize and knew something about the oppressive political situation in Burma so the political message of the movie was mostly a dramatization of what I already knew But I thought the movie did a good job of telling about Aung San Suu Kyi and the mostlyfaceless dictators who have for years tried to silence her The device of presenting an unfamiliar setting through the eyes of a character that viewers can identify with is fairly common but its quite well done in this movie Of course the real measure of the movie was its entertainment value Arquette was excellent as a young woman whose sister took her to a distant unfamiliar place to shake her out of her depression over the violent deaths of her husband and son She is convincingly detached and depressed Her grieving condition gives her a clear reason for her distracted wanderings into the thick of a dangerous situation she does not understand something shed otherwise be much too intelligent to stumble into Once the dangers become so obvious that she can see through them even through the cloud of grief shes trapped with no easy escape That sets her on a path of adventure where she needs her intelligence to survive The writers deserve much credit for making her intelligent and resourceful enough to deal with numerous dangerous situations while still finding a plausible reason for her to be foolish enough to get into trouble in the first place The directing is strong also keeping up the tension throughout the race to escape the forces of the dictatorship This movie had additional impact on me and my wife because of other events of the same time period We were preparing for a trip to India and heard news reports of Western tourists who had been taken hostage by a terrorist group in India Avoiding isolated terrorists in a peaceful democratic country is quite a different matter from escaping an oppressive dictatorship But the movie and the news shared the element of avoiding danger in an unfamiliar country That common characteristic gave the movie meaning beyond the strength of its own skillful storytelling The movie illustrates the international tourists worst nightmare
1,Jean Renoirs homage to the Paris of the late 19th century is beautiful in many ways Not only does it appear to have been photographed by ToulouseLautrec and Mucha it portrays the geographic Paris the streets accessible only by staircases the unpleasant end of fleeting popularity and the sexual opportunism of men with a product to sell in an uncompromising picture of show business that is in stark contrast with the picture painted by Hollywood There is an obvious comparison to be made with Lloyd Bacons 42nd Street which had been made about 20 years before featuring Ruby Keeler as a dancing sensation a freshfaced kid from the sticks who had come to New York to get into show business who saves the show when the star failsYoure going out there a kid from the chorus but youve got to come back a STAR Warner Baxters Julian Marsh is a director who suffers for his art and is unappreciated Jean Gabins Danglard keeps running afoul of genital politics but when he talks about the show he is more like Knute Rockne than like Julian Marsh Hes all about the game exceptfor his pointy thing He has a profitable new venture sewed up until his mistress become jealous of the woman whom she recognizes as his next mistress His prospects rise and fall with every coital journey he takes  Danglard takes Mistress 1 Lola de Castro played by Maria Felix slumming to a dive where he sees Nini Françoise Arnoul with her boyfriend and first lover Paulo the baker and discovers that she is a spirited dancer He uses his charm and the prospect of money to lure Nini to studying dancing so that she may go on the stage The prospect of money and fame charms Nini and she become Danglards next mistress as well as an apt student of the cancan which Danglard has dubbed French Cancan to cater to the current Anglophile tendency in the dance Both 42nd St and French Cancan are tributes to show businessto modern entertainmentthat has is own iconography and its own conceit 42nd St is centered around Julian Marsh a great director of Broadway shows which he organizes with great personal energy and dubious sexual involvement The male juvenile is a middleaged twit with lumbago replaced by Dick Powell the pretty tenor with secret wealth to hide Danglard on the other hand goes from woman to woman seducing them with the promise of fame hooking them with what must have been a very persuasive endowment One has no doubt that he is heterosexual and quite active Postcoital scenes abound Days after seducing Nini away from Paulo he has discovered Esther a Piaf type and begun to prepare her for her job of singing the films theme song while he plays it on her fiddle That of course arouses Ninis jealousy just as she has aroused the jealousy of Lola And of course Nini had already forsworn the privilege of being a Czarina The whole movie is about how Danglards concupiscence has cost him money but how even his troublesome horniness is subordinate to his love for the showhow the audience demands devotionand it is this potent combination of phallic persuasion and tempting fame that makes Danglard the hero while asserting that a true lover of the show will never profit as much as the money men At the movies conclusion Danglard having outfoxed the creditors and the jealous babes approaches a new attraction watching the incredible and believe me it IS incredible performance of the cancan Have you ever thought about being on the stage he asks and the curtain descends Meanwhile poor Julian is sitting of the fire escape of the theatre listening to Peggy Sawyers new fans disparage his contribution to the shows success I wont even go into 42nd Streets central line Oh Guy it was GRAND of you to COME  Furthermore I wont go into the glimpse one gets of legendary Parisian entertainers including a brief vision of Piaf nor of the vision of a Paris both urban and rural Certainly there is a sample of the styles that engendered Trenet and Aznavour But it is the memoir of an assertive and welcome masculinity something unseen in any Hollywood musical with which it might be compared is a pleasant relief from the androgynes of 30s Hollywood musicals including my beloved Fred Astaire not to mention Dick Powell let alone the barf promulgated by MGM in movies like the repulsive American in Paris All those fountains Well save our comparison of that turkey to Breakfast at Tiffanys and its deconstruction of the American male for another day That Danglard may have been a hopeful vision in postwar France of a kind of hypermasculine mec that may or may not have ever existed is practically beside the point That he is a mans man neither John Wayne nor Edward Everett Horton is perhaps more on target That he is a man who likes the ladies is never in question I for one wouldnt mind living his life at all I wonder if Gabin was that lucky  At the beginning of this comment I wanted to talk about Baz Luhrman and what Sinclair Lewis called boloney I never got that far Bazs Moulin Rouge well Paris doesnt put that kind of stuff in the Seine anymore
1,This film biography of early rock and roll star Buddy Holly 19361959 is a tour de force for Gary Busey The movies highlights are Buseys stage performances where he plays guitar and sings Holly songs He brings such energy to the performances that Hollys own filmed performances almost pale in comparison Buseys infectious toothy grin lights up the screen he creates a totally believable and winning personality and his Oscar nomination for best actor was well deserved The film follows Hollys career from growing up in Lubbock Texas to stardom and New York and his untimely death in a plane crash One thing I found interesting if true was Buddys driving ambitionhe had great plans to go beyond recording and performance to producing As young as he was he was already establishing himself as a shrewd businessman and definitely wanted to take things to a higher level We will never know if he would have ultimately catapulted his early success into a business brand like The Rolling Stones The lyrics of many of Hollys songs are pretty adolescent read the lyrics for Peggy Sue or Oh Boy and you will see what I mean Maybe to a great extent this explains his popularity with adolescent audiences but his instrumentation and stage performances surely account for his influence on groups to followboth The Rolling Stones and The Beatles have acknowledged his importance Clearly some liberties were taken for dramatic effect For example I doubt that Holly ever punched out a producer in Nashville or that the audience at New Yorks Apollo theater was so immediately responsive as to be wildly dancing in the aisles If you are interested in getting closer to the truth see the documentary The Real Buddy Holly Story 1985 that is produced and hosted by a very relaxed and engaging Paul McCartney This contains interviews with Hollys family friends and bandmates Hollys musical brothers are not even mentioned in The Buddy Holly Story Members of other bands like Keith Richards and Don Everly also offer opinions and stories and there is footage of old Holly performances The McCartney production can stand on its own but it makes an excellent companion piece to The Buddy Holly Story and perhaps should be required viewing for anyone who watches the fictionalized story
1,Loved the shots of airports  Dallas Phoenix Fresno etc just single buildings with the name in block letters on the roof And the trimotors and the welldressed passengers Fastforward 75 years But what really got to me was the hammer and sickle emblem and what appeared to be a Chinese ideogram adjacent the logo aft of the pilots seat on the starboard side of the fuselage Remember when the mutual acquaintance Neil and Jill encounter says that Jimd become a general in a Chinese rebel army That based on the hammer and sickle could only have been the Peoples Revolutionary Army of Mao Tse Dung Never mind the undies and the unwed twosome in bed  would that logo and that reference have survived during the Cold War  Additional observation 1227 This film of the 30s with the soviet emblem maymust also reflect the influence on and charm of communism in Hollywood and much of America during the Depression Adds to the historical value of this terrific film  Also I liked the American Dream aspects of two guys from Winnemucca taking at least part of the world by storm RedBlooded literally and copiously in Jims caseAmerican Boys Others have commented more ably than I on the aerobatics etc I loved it all This gem deserved more than the mere 15 stars Osborne and Co rated it on TCM if only for recording parts of American history of the early 30s
1,Scooby Doo and the Monster of Mexico was no doubt the weakest of the modern Scooby Doo animated features Loch Ness Monster is a considerable improvement This time the gang head off to Scotland to see the Highland Games and visit Blake castle Daphnes ancestral home And wouldnt you know the castle happens to be in the quaint fishing village of Drumnadrochit on the shores of Loch Ness During their stay they meet a few interesting folks First there is Fiona Pembrooke a scientist who has drowned all of her money into finding the Loch Ness Monster Sir Ian Locksley the boss of the National Heritage Museum of Scotland he is staunch nonbeliever of Nessie The Haggarts the own a cozy Inn on the shores of the loch The sons are a couple of local jokers always into mischief Del Chilman a wild paranoid hippie dude who is convinced the monster is out there and will stop at nothing on find her And finally Duncan MacGubbin the dock master who has seen Nessie too many times to count Most of these characters are stereotypes which gets a bit annoying as this is teaching younger audiences a load of crap and giving the wrong impression However if you can immune yourself to it youll be alright Being from Scotland I cant help but wince at the awfully mimicked Scottish accents Fact We DONT sound like that Soon enough Nessie looking rather more demonic than usual shows up and causes havoc Looks like the gang have another mystery on their hands The usual chase scenes clues and Shaggys wacky disguises follow There are plenty of laughs The animation is splendid with some atmospheric scenes and locations And the plot a lot better than Monster of Mexico The only bad thing this time around is the music I miss Louis Febres scoring and the songs here are pretty rotten too Where are the Hex Girls when you need em The region 2 DVD is in crystal clear 1781 anamorphic widescreen the region 1 aint with Dolby 50 sound Some okay extras are included Definitely worth getting
1,This episode so far is the best of the series The story was told perfectly I especially liked how the writers made it a Desmond episode it was his best performance to date and he definitely deserved the Emmy for his performance We had some of our questions answered in this episode but since the show is called Lost we know there will be more questions brought up too First the answered Walt is reunited finally with his father Michael second Michaels betrayal is exposed to Jack Sawyer Kate and Hurly and because of this betrayal Kate Jack and Sawyer are all taken captive by The Others This was a great way to end the show On the other side of the island we see Locke going through a mental breakdown with the button This leads to another answered question about how the plane really went down However there are some unanswered questions first what happened to Locke Eko and Desmond when Desmond turned the failsafe key and what was the deal with the scientists in the Arctic searching for electromagnetic annamolies Guess well find out next season however great ending to the best show on TV
1,A Brief History of Time is not only a documentary on the beginning and the ending of the universal and reality as we know it this is a story about the man and the genius known as Stephen Hawking It is his story that reflects the story of time and change throughout the history of the universal The style of the documentary  editing style of the interviews begin and end with a quick fade to black Almost like blinking in between segments and interviews the documentary gives you an odd feeling like this is the view point of Stephen Hawking and not the eye of the camera The running time is only a little longer than an hour It is a short story then again its subject matter could be talked about for days and days An interesting and proud story
1,This allbutignored masterpiece is about the Monkees becoming aware that they are fictional characters in a movie Head and that everything they do or say had already been written in an unseen script they seem to be following Head was written by Jack Nicholson Rafelson and Peter Tork during a threeday LSD trip in a suite at an expensive Hollywood hotel The other three Monkees only acted in it They fight this every way they can by doing things not in the script They deliberately flub their lines walk off sets tear up scenery punch other actors for no reason and ultimately commit suicide by jumping off a bridge  For instance in the rapid flashes of a psychedelic party scene if you watch framebyframe you can see Rafelson sitting next to the camera and cameraman very deliberately shooting into a mirror He is revealing that the party is actually fake and is being shot in a studio with actors who suddenly drop out of character and walk away in the middle of a conversation when the Director yells cut The Monkees however never drop out of character because those characters are also who they really are That ends up being the core of the Revelation soon to come At every turn they realize their increasinglybizarre actions were exactly what they were supposed to do in the scripted film they cant escape being in You say they went crazy and walked through the sky which turns out to be painted on paper and hung from the ceiling as the sets background No problem Hey hey theyre the Monkees and those wacky guys just keep monkeying around  In the end even their deaths did not set them free That was how the movie was supposed to end and their motionless waterlogged bodies are fished out of the river put in another box and stacked in a film studio warehouse until the characters are needed again for another studio production This is made all the more poignant by the fact that the Monkees really ARE fictional characters who forced themselves into the real world They did it through the power of their music Ironically near the end Peter Tork has what he rightly sees as a hugely profound revelation that solves their problem but unfortunately no one listens  Peter realizes It doesnt MATTER if were in the box the film He means that it doesnt matter if will is free or illusory and that the only important thing is that you just let the present moment occur and occur You need to just let now HAPPEN as it happens without analyzing or evaluating or judging whether the experience is valid by some abstract definition When you cant even tell the difference will being free or not doesnt mattertying to figure out if you are the real you is just a pointless waste of time I saw this film at a very important time in my life I was trying to figure out how to escape being just that geeky creepy nerd girl by thinking about it intensely instead of just having fun ie sex like everyone else did But the revelation in Head broke my selfimposed recursive trap and helped me more than Rafelson or Nicholson or Tork will ever know For decades Ive watched Head and wished I could thank Pete Was this a good movie Uhh how about like  YES 
1,Well its safe to say that Subconscious Cruelty is one weird film Supposedly an insight into the human mind Subconscious Cruelty is comprises four macabre and bizarre tales of the extreme The first segment entitled Ovarian Eyeball is really just a warm up but its good in that it gives the viewer an idea of what to expect from the next three segments It simply sees a naked woman laid out on a table while another woman cuts into her abdomen and pulls out a human eyeball Ive got no idea what the point is but it certainly makes for visceral viewing The following story is the best of the bunch and takes in the old favourite sick movie theme of incest The segment follows a man who lives alone with his pregnant sister Hes repulsed by her pregnancy  yet he wants to have sex with her anyway and naturally he gets his way This story stands out because of the monotonous and matter of fact narration as well as the ending  which doesnt fail to deliver the shocks This segment is well acted well filmed and easily the highlight of Subconscious Cruelty Naturally the next two sections arent as good as the second one so the only way from there is down but director Karim Hussain still manages to pull something out of the bag before the film ends He doesnt do it right away however as the third segment is the weakest of the film and simply sees a lot of people have sex with the ground Its very surreal and therefore memorable for that same reason but there doesnt seem to be a lot of point to it and I was in the mood for something a bit more morbid after the second section The film ends on a high however as while Im not entirely sure what the point was  the final segment features the films best imagery This segment focuses on religion and certainly isnt for anyone that values it Director Karim Hussain has achieved something here  as while this collection of four extreme stories doesnt come together as a complete whole the film almost feels tasteful as its shot in such an eloquent and eye catching manner The director would seem to have been imitating the highly respected surreal director Luis Buñuel albeit with gore rape and incest and if you ask me he hasnt done a bad job at all Not for everyone but certainly worth a look for extreme fanatics
1,My wife and I endorse all the positive comments below made by other IMDB members While this is no box office smash hit it has a special charm all of its own Genuine and heartwarming We saw this on video at the end of a long day We were very tired and in bed Normally in a situation like this my wife drops off to sleep within minutes that is unless it is an exceptional movie and this one kept us both entertained right to the very end Perhaps younger viewers in their teens and twenties would not like this but for the rest of us it is a true gem See it
1,Piper Prue and Phoebe bring Dr Griffiths to the Manor in order to try and save him from The Sources personal assassin Shax Whilst Phoebe looks in the Book of Shadows for a spell to vanquish Shax Prue and Piper are attacked by Shax and chase him into the street Unbeknownst to Prue and Piper they were filmed by a news reporter and her cameraman using their powers and broadcasted live on national television With Phoebe in the Underworld Prue Piper and Leo must find a way to reverse the damage done Leo goes down to Phoebe and tells her that the Charmed Ones have been exposed as witches On the surface Piper is shot by a manic witchwannabe and Prue has to take her to the hospital The problem here is that the crowds are blocking the driveway So Prue has to use her magic on the crowd and they go to the hospital Piper is pronounced dead and a SWAT team moves in Leo learns of Pipers death and goes down to tell Phoebe Cole is asked to ask The Source to reset time and The Source agrees only if Phoebe turns to the dark side Phoebe agrees but the deal will shatter them Up on the surface Prue and Piper are battling Shax Prue shouts out for Phoebe who unbeknownst to them is in the Underworld Shax throws Piper and Prue through a wall and Dr Griffiths out of a window Prue is not pronounced dead until the Season 4 Premiere episode Charmed Again Part One All Hell Breaks Loose is a gripping episode and it made me sit on the edge of my seat Sad that Prues dead but happy that there will be five more seasons of Charmed My vote 10 out of 10 EXCELLENT
1,There are moments when you dont want those deep dramaseries When you dont want series with heavy stories or a must to watch every single episode to be able to hang on There are moments when you just want to watch a simple series with lots of action and cool characters For those moments you have Cleopatra 2525 I was one of those who actually enjoyed Charlies Angels Critics said it was to superficial and silly But the thing is thats the point People who cant relax and expected a serious movie hated it Its exactly the same with Cleopatra 2525 It is superficial It has silly and unrealistic characters And thats why I like it It isnt like any other series The first season wasnt very good The character Cleo was irritating and a little too much The story was a little lame and you didnt get to know the characters very much But hey they only had 20 minutes in every episode In the last 56 episodes of Cleopatra 2525 they finally gave the series full 40minutes length And it was here I started to love it The series finally started to grow into a very qualitative series Too bad they had to cancel the series Because the last episodes of Cleopatra 2525 actually was very good I will never forget Hel Sarge and Cleo Unique characters that only the creators of Xena could have created
1,Two great stars and a legendary Director created a magnificent throbbing love story that is memorable and moving on so many levels Henry King directed Jennifer Jones in her first hit Song of Bernadette and he again directs Jennifer Jones in this film and Miss Jones is perfect in this role and gives a edgy beautiful performance that captures the conflict in the character and Bill Holden who hit home run after home run in the l950s with a series of smash hit films beginning with Sunset Blvd Stalag 17 Born YesterdayCountry Girl Picnic and of course River Kwai is superb in this roleHard to imagine anyone but Holden in this movie I loved the ending and cry every time I see it For anyone who has ever loved and lost you will understand For those who havent you wont
1,I enjoyed appreciated will view this movie again because I am sure There are subtleties that I missed Wonderfully cast no over acting or Cliché performance or plot Uses a tragic event to reflect multiple Relationships how those involved in each relationship are connected Or disconnected and perceptions of life what position each one Occupies in the relationship in life and how they cope with the Confusion joy hurt and disappointment of discovering that things are not what they perceived them to be At first I thought there were Observers and the observed but that is not the case we are all connected somehow and our perceived separation is only in small degrees I recommend the movie to everyone especially those in teaching social work religious counseling and every other person that breaths
1,Once again we are fortunate to see a gorgeous opening scene where the artists work has been fully restored and we see this oldtime grocery store on a street corner with the snow gently falling Inside are the rich colors of all the merchandise from produce to canned and boxed goods to medicine to candy etc In essence this is a story of those goods coming to life such as the animals on the labels of items or a pie or even a pack of cigarettes The whole show is narrated by Jack Bunny a Jack Benny impersonator with music from conductor Leopold Stokowski who was in so many Looney Tunes animated shorts I have lost count A lot of the humor is topical so it pays to know who Little Egypt and other characters The Busby Berkeleytype aqua number with bathing suitedsardines coming out of the can and the tomato cancan dance were both clever  All of the above and more was in the first half of this slightly longerthannormal length cartoon The second half was about a King Kongtype which escapes from the Animal Crackers box and terrorizes everyone That part was not much and ended on a somewhat stupid note So an A for the first half a D for the second making it about a Cplus or Bminus overall
1,I saw this film when it was released to theaters Its definitely one to remember I had forgotten the title until recently A friend found it via online search One Dark Night is rather unusual for the suspensehorror genre of the time in that it contains no blood It is of the teen fright variety yet the teens are respectable in their own ways Its a nice oldschool film with props and scenes that reflect the times Our hero rides a motorcycle with no brain bucket for example As has been mentioned by previous reviewers One Dark Night is currently available on DVD The original negative was not available for the DVD transition Some reel changes are a bit rough but this doesnt take away from the story That being said the colors are vibrant and the lighting is very good Adam West plays a rather smallish part in this film as RayMars soninlaw His role as an overbearing and indifferent husband is thankfully short The story builds over the course of the film Unlike many horror films of the era One Dark Night is a great suspense story that gives the viewer time to absorb what is happening The final 20 minutes or so of One Dark Night are what make it so memorable RayMars telekinetic abilities are used to open old graves in the mausoleum pull the coffins out open them and move the corpses around Attention was afforded to great detail in the final scenes The rotting wormriddled corpses look quite real
1,Has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating TV networks made it possible for people to produce direct finance andor star in their own films who might otherwise not have been able to Is that a good thing  This film does not answer the latter question either way but it does appear that without Curb Jeff Garlin would not have been able to make I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With  Like most new producersdirectors Jeff Garlins independent piece heaves a heavily more sensitive sigh than the vehicle he is primarily known for Curb And yet is it a sensitive guy film He isnt really a sensitive guy Likable sure Relatable indeed  What this film really is about is a bit hard to say I can only relate what I took away from it  I rented the film because of the trailers particularly the scene of a counselor portrayed by Amy Sedaris informing James Aaron Garlin that a particular woman is interested in him mainly because she is a chubby chaser I just about fell out of my seat Based on that scene alone I ran to my computer to write a note to myself to rent this movie The reason  I thought the school counselor Sedaris was talking about Beth portrayed by Sarah Silverman I imagined a lightish romantic comedy between the foxy Silverman and the fat Garlin I didnt think the story would be anything original but that the dialogue would be snappy and the scenes would move along at a satisfying pace In short I thought it would be a comedy  It was intriguing that the film started out that way but then took a much much more realistic turn when Beth gives James the heave ho because Ive never really been with a fat guy before That is how brutally we live life and it was completely realistic I applaud the decision It just meant that Beth has now left the building and with her the one snappy person in the film Jamess relationship with his mother was also interesting That part made me wonder if the whole concept did not start out as a play It had that intricate feel to it The whole Marty movie within a movie thing was utterly lost on me as I have never seen that film There were serious doubts I had about the character of James Aaron though Is it really possible that at 39 he had not had a serious relationship And he is an actor That did not really square with me To me his persona was less actory and more corporate I could not really buy his ordinariness either No doubt he was extremely disappointed that things with Beth did not work out We felt that But then did he really care  Another thing  how in the world can both he and his mother afford to move out at the same time Hasnt he just lost his job The last one he had That was one reason he did not seem ordinary to me Wheres the funding for his life coming from  And yet I have read reviews that talk about the realistic portrayal of urban loneliness so there is that Yes it is very realistic the way we must be satisfied with what we have because it is all that we have The way we sort of disappear from ourselves and each other in interactions James and Stella some kind of selfeffacement that takes place just to move on to the next moment That contrasted with the possibility of defining ourselves through our moments our thoughts the way James had with Beth its really crushing Very well done
1,This is definitely the biggest surprise of the festival so far and without a doubt the best the festival has had to offer I went into this film with little to no expectations after learning that the director was responsible for the awful vampire flick The Forsaken and I left pleasantly surprised The film stars Lori heuring of In Crowd fame as a young mother whose husband has just passed She moves into an old family home in the mountains with her two daughters next to a mine that is a gravesite to overworked children back in the day Unlucky for them the children return with a vengeance killing and eating everyone in their path The film works on many levels Its well done suspenseful it has spots of good cinematography and capable performances by Compton especially The atmosphere is spooky yet slightly underwhelming the score is decent and the makeup effects are gruesome and simplistic The film keeps up a creepy and unsettling tone and the kids themselves with pale skin torn up lips and hollow eyes are pretty scary and unrelenting The film is original and inventive without being to artsy or complicated I cant see this film making it into a wide release without some trimming and slight fine tuning But they definitely have a good product on there hands and should pursue some type of theatrical distribution However the theatre in which i saw it in was horrible The sound was dreadfully messed up which i felt took away from the film majorly and it stopped in the middle because they couldnt center it on the screen which killed the mood a bit All in all though it was the most satisfying of horrorfests entries maybe because it had the least expectations but nonetheless was a welcome addition to genre films
1,I first saw this masterpiece on VHS 10 years ago and the powerful interpretation on angrykidpainfullyagainstestablishedsociety it carried stayed in my heart since then Director Hector Babenco is such a good humanity who finds a delicate angle to tell the story of how urbanity kills the childhood of the kids from poverty class Even the outcast kids have their innocent beautiful dreams But the corrupt reality never gives a chance Thanks to the publishers for the recent DVD release I now can keep this great movie to my favorite collection
1,Many other viewers are saying that this is not a good movie to watch since they feel that it isnt realistic How can it not be considered realistic They feel that say the incest part isnt easy to relate to that it isnt common i can guarantee you that you have met more people than you think that have had an incest act occur Many of them arent going to come out and say it and mostly these are victims Also many people are Gay and are still in the closest because no matter how much they would like it to be they know they will be ridiculed and possibly even abandoned And tell me how many kids have you went to high school with that has ended up being pregnant or had an eating disorder i bet a lot and although pregnancy isnt from incest most of the time its still easy to relate to Who cant relate to being an outcast or being bullied that happens all the time and many viewers are probably concerned with there education such as Marcus being a stoner seems to be quite common these days to so there are a lot of things to relate to More than the rest though no matter how popular you may get sometimes you feel invisible or alone not noticed or overlooked such as the suicide victim how can you not feel like you can relate to the movie I find that the movie may have seemed pointless to others but i would like to think of it as important It an interesting way of showing that suicide happens and to be aware it comes from the people that dont show their unhappy thoughts its very surprising The people who show there problems do commit suicide sometimes to but when you hear of suicide who would have guessed is usually running through most peoples minds The ending surprised me i wasnt expecting it to be the girl that until the end was mostly an extra in the scenes not even introduced the story even in its description says its about 6 teenage lives when in fact it was 7 My only real disappointment was that it wasnt one of the characters that we got to learn about it merely at first seems like the movie was pointless to watch if the real victim is just some random chick until i thought more it made perfect sense for being a huge surprise since thats what suicides are like plus who was to choose who any of the other students had more of a reason than the other though this movie has some bad points most movies have a few but i would recommend this movie as long as you can deal with watching the tragic moments of watching the suicide and violence and profanity shown in this film
1,There is no plot There are no central characters There are no moving cameras or closeups In fact this film does not follow any of the conventional storytelling techniques used by mainstream film However Roy Anderssons Du Levande is a remarkable piece of cinematic storytelling It is a touching look at the human psyche Comprised of a series of vignettes Roy Andersson gives us an intimate insight into what makes us all human In perfectly framed static shots added with the perfectly in tune yet quirky music Roy introduces us to a host of characters as they undertake their daily existence Some bordering on tragic others hilarious we are taken on a Nordic journey like no other It is a journey into the little things that make us human Instead of overthetop storytelling or visual techniques everything is stripped down to the bare minimum so that our sole focus is on the characters themselves It focuses on the insignificant points of our lives that make us who we are our dreams our desperation Its through this simple observation of others that we can accept who we are as individuals The washed out colours and deathlypale makeup of the characters only seems to emphasize their individual stories and remind us that unlike them we are all alive There is no happy ending or light at the end of the tunnel in this film yet you walk out of the cinema with a sense of life Much more accessible than his earlier film Songs from the Second Floor Du Levande is a truly inspiring piece of cinema
1,As you can tell from the few comments posted here  mine may very well be the last youll see unless there is a big DVDrelease or TCM plays it again   this is a kindof Our Gang movie with a bunch of different kids MGM certainly WAS the musical studio  if the musicians dancers and singers werent under contract they were on tap Heifetz was one of the most expensivethat does it for a little charity work  The fee he received in that era was unheard of Another musical film with Jose Iturbi Mexican pianist featured about 100 kids playing some simple tune on 100 pianosso those skeptics who think young children arent musical are mistaken I was one As all write Frankie Smith  goodole American name  Gene Reynolds was the badbutgood kid who is takenin from the streets by the owners of a musicschool Can you believe that Walter Brennan Prof Lawson of all those western movies was the man running the school Joel McCrea Peter McCarthy and Andrea Leeds Ann Lawson were the bigger stars in They Shall Have Music with a host of wellknown extras many of whom wenton to become stars in their own rights As others have commented almost all of the kids in the orchestra actually The Meremblum Symphony from Los Angeles made big successes of their lives either as musicians for the studios and other businesses Sad to say there arent that many youngpeoples orchestras today  a sad mistake Parents with children in school are usually so busy trying to keep their heads above water and many dont even know what is happening to the kids in school Musical instruction can get to be pricey and almost EVERYONE would rather had a footballteam This is the cheapest concert by Jascha Heifetz youll ever hear is contained in this moviein those days a quarter His playing is brilliant even if he looks like hed rather be someplace elseemotionless By contract any concert by YoYo Ma is so joyful it makes you want to run right out and buy a cellothis guy is having a good timelike the kids in the street concert when they hoodwink Heifetz to play at their school All of the orchestral numbers were played by the kids and they make it sound easy I love this type of movie  their plots are so simple it doesnt take you two days to figureout if you enjoyed  or understood  the movie at all We need some new movies like this  cant do anything but inspire younger kids to play other instruments than guitarsBravo
1,This film was made right in the area where I grew up and now live I know personally most of the property owners of the various locations used in the film As a teenager I worked in the fields surrounding the isolated road shown late in the film with Ron Perlman Jonathon Furr and the car I am told that Jonathon Furr and Ben Allison are are natives of NC I was fortunate to see it at a local showing At that showing was one of the people who helped select locations and secure props such as the bus 1938 Greyhound used in the movie The bus had no reverse gear and during filming the driver missed his stopping point a few times and had to drive several miles to return to the proper point Those details of the technical issues added to the enjoyment for me The film accurately depicts life in this area during WWII A well done film and I anxiously await the DVD availability
1,I found this movie to be a simple yet wonderful comedy This movie is purely entertaining I can watch it time and time again and still enjoy the dialog and chemistry between the characters I truly hope for a DVD release
1,Rita Hayworth is right there where she should be  as a Cover Girl in this 1944 Technicolor film also starring Gene Kelly Phil Silvers Eve Arden Lee Bowman and Otto Kruger Rita plays a beautiful showgirl Rusty working at a small club owned by the man she loves Danny Kelly Each Friday they go out for oysters with Genius Silvers the club comedian They all hate oysters but theyre looking for a pearl When they find one all three of them will have good luck they believe Rusty auditions and wins the role of cover girl for a magazine  she starts off ahead of the other contestants because the magazine owner Kruger sees a resemblance between Rusty and the girl he once loved who turns out to be Rustys grandmother Once she becomes the cover girl the world opens up for her and her dreams of appearing on Broadway come true Danny wants her to have her success but at the same time realizes hes lost her Cover Girl has exuberant dance numbers and songs by Jerome Kern with Rita dubbed by Martha Mears Rita is at her best playing both Rusty in the present and her grandmother in the past For such a sexy desirable gorgeous woman she was apparently very insecure and always under the thumb of domineering men None of this ever showed on screen nor did the fact that she didnt want to be a movie star She is one of the true goddesses and brought everything she did to life Gene Kelly is in a serious role here but gets plenty of chances to dance and sing Phil Silvers is very amiable and funny as the inhouse comic and best friend This is a very good movie with no dull spots The only problem I had is the idea that Rusty has to choose between a successful career and the man she loves When supermodel Jinx Falkenberg who plays herself in the film speaks of getting married shes warned by her boss not to that shes too necessary to the modeling business Were not told if Rusty continues with her career or goes back to work at Dannys  but all signs seemed to point toward the Brooklyn club Why couldnt she have had both Nevertheless you cant beat Cover Girl for top entertainment beautiful color lovely music great energy fine performances and its most fabulous asset the glorious Rita Hayworth
1,This is the forty minute film that introduces us to the character of the Butcher who will later be examined more thoroughly in the feature Seul Contre Tous In this film it follows the early period of his life from 19651979 but focusing on the late seventies The first images are of a slaughter of a horse then the birth of a baby the Butchers daughter who we quickly see growing up each year The Butcher played by Philippe Nahon in both films is a man bitter with the world He hates many things His anger comes to a head when a man assaults his autistic daughter The Butcher then maims the wrong man and finds himself in prison This film follows the butchers life to just after his release from prison then Seul Contre Tous takes over from there I watched the films the wrong way about Seul Contre Tous first Try and watch this little film first if you can
1,The films subject is poignant and very real It happened One can debate some artistic liberties taken by director and scriptwriter The subject is what makes the film ticknothing else I saw the film for the first time after the real Phoolan was gunned down in New Delhi and had served several years as an elected Member of Parliament in India By the way she was not the first untouchable elected to Parliament as some reviewers stated The socalled untouchables have been elected to the Indian Parliament for decades in reserved constituencies While Shekhar Kapur as a director is a hero to many India because he made commercially accepted international filmsBandit Queen and Elizabeth and a tolerable kiddie movie called Mister India which was accepted by the average Indian audiencesand even got Oscar nominations for Elizabeth I do not place him as a top notch film director from India He fails in every department as a director except perhaps that he succeeds in getting some aboveaverage performances from his actors Subtlety finesse charm are not easy to find in his filmsmelodrama brims in them His idea of using Nusrat Fateh Ali Khans vocal rendering of the song in the early parts of the film was perhaps his single major achievement on the undistinguished sound track of Bandit Queen And then perhaps the creaking doors during the gang rape sequence Otherwise the film looked like a spaghetti western with sex and violence minus the great music one associates with them  If you are looking for a good living Indian film director who makes realistic cinema of international qualityit is not Shekhar Kapurs movies you should see it is the later works of three Indian filmmakers Adoor Gopalakrishnan Mrinal Sen and Girish Karnad and of course Muzaffar Alis Umrao Jaan It is unfortunate that none of those directors had the financial support that Kapur had to give them and their films an international viewership For instance Sens Oka oorie katha made in Telugu or Satyajit Rays Sadgati based on Munshi Prem Chands Kafan are more complete as films to an intelligent viewer dealing on the state of the untouchables in India Sen did not have to resort to graphic sex and violence but merely suggested them Of course Sens nugget did not make headlines while Kapurs effort hogged them To Kapurs credit he is articulate and used his limited talent and modest resources in the Mumbai film industry to take his products beyond home audiences For that effort I salute Kapur But Bandit Queen will remain a great subject awaiting an accomplished director to deal with it
1,This is one of the classic TWILIGHT ZONE episodes where with the simplest of situations the viewer was drawn into a seemingly symbolic conflict only to find the solution surprising and strangely acceptable Five figures are inside a containerprison a Major a ballerina a bagpiper a clown and a tramp They are certainly an odd choice of types to be in this isolation chamber but they are all in it nevertheless and they are trying to figure out why they are there What have they in common None can figure it out But gradually the Major organizes them into working to bet out by standing on each others shoulders And the Major going to the top of the line of figures does reach the entrance and  Ill leave it like that although one of the other critiques on this thread actually gives the story away The title seems to be suggested by SIX CHARACTERS IN SEARCH OF AN AUTHOR Pirandellos famous play Whether the actual purpose to the show was to spoof that play is questionable Pirandellos characters analyze their roles and relations with each other But the five characters here while they try to understand their situation are totally in the dark  they are not in the situation of the six characters in Pirandello who know their current situations This uncertainty of what is going on allows the viewers to think it is an abstract drama The actors William Windon as the Major and Murray Mattheson as the Clown in particular give good accounts of themselves And the conclusion whether planned as a spoof or not is quite effective
1,Im not sure where to start with this In short it was a disappointing movie Having taught the novella I was aware that it would be a hard story to turn into a movie The movie has a couple of interesting lines mainly between Alfred and Aschenbach but it doesnt represent the debate on art that basically shapes the novella  For one I was expecting an older Aschenbach and a younger Tadzio In the book Tadzio is fourteen but he is described as pure ideal innocent whereas in the movie he reeks of sexuality and is a tease He is an accomplice to Aschenbach he always looks back at him almost provokingly In the book it is Aschenbach who steals glances at the boy As for Aschenbach I imagined something closer to the professorturnedclown in The Blue Angel based on a story by Thomas Manns brother Heinrich than this fortyyear old with hardly any gray hair In all fairness I do think that Dirk Bogarde did a good job but either someone else should have done that or he should have made to look older at the beginning  I know that the discovery of homosexuality is important to the story but the movie minimizes the talk about art and the duality between the Apollonian and Dyonisian inspirations and focuses instead on Aschenbachs obsession of Tadzio and does not justify it I liked the fact that Mahlers music was used because ultimately he did inspire Mann to write his story Im not sure turning Aschenbach into a musician was a particularly good move Or the creation of Alfred who I dont remember in the book And one thing that really got to me was the sound and how it did not match the actors lips I was wondering if it was dubbed because I expected it to be in Italian But then I remembered that each Italian movie I have watched has this problem It just bothers me because these directors Fellini is the other person Im thinking of are supposed to epitomize perfection in Italian cinema and here are their characters laughing without sound then you hear a noise that doesnt correspond to their faces Im thinking of the scenes when Aschenbach almost collapses and starts laughing This scene couldshould have been the strongest but it was annoying instead
1,Imaginary Heroes is a 2004 film starring Sigourney Weaver Jeff Daniels Emile Hirsch Michelle Williams and Kip Pardue The story concerns a dysfunctional family that becomes even more dysfunctional when the oldest child Pardue commits suicide Ordinary People has been mentioned often in relation to this film its sort of Ordinary People with a role reversal The mother in this case Sandy Travis Weaver is more accessible than the father Ben Daniels who is clearly devastated and unable to cope Like Ordinary People the younger son Tim Hirsch is the focus of the film For me the film was absorbing enough to keep watching but has a curious detachment about it There were some wonderful interactions  mother and son mother and neighbor brother and sister Williams and some good offbeat moments What never clicked was Ben being any part of that family or having any chemistry with Sandy This seems to have been the goal of directorwriter Dan Harris In one scene in a grocery store the checkout kid assumes Sandy is about 30 and gives her his phone number In almost the next scene Daniels asks Sandy if she wants plastic surgery for her birthday Weaver was 55 when this film was made actually probably 54 and looks phenomenal So what is Ben looking at However theres something askew about Bens complete detachment because the viewer doesnt really see how Daniels ever WAS attached to that family The end has a couple of twists and also some very touching scenes Everyone is very good with Weaver and Hirsch being the standouts Theres not a tremendous amount of dialogue in this movie and lots of stares The script could have been sharper But Imaginary Heroes is a good effort
1,I saw Night of the Demons 2 first before I saw Night of the Demons Unfortunately my old Blockbuster thought it was a good idea to have the sequel but no first one Looney huh Now I think all horror fans need this movie Its like McDonalds you know its bad for you and youd rather have The Cheesecake Facotoryor whatever pricier restaurant you prefer but you cant help but just wanting the cheap stuff Night of the Demons has it all your innocent sexy goes by the rules chickadee your token black guy that surprisingly doesnt get killed Youre slutty girl youre slutty guy youre dark girl or guy the goof ball the cheesy settings of a haunted house bad acting and lots of unnecessary nudity Isnt this stuff great I mean I know deep down in my heart of movies that this was pretty bad but it was a good bad for horror movies Horror fans should enjoy and dig in 810
1,I really enjoyed this movie I have probably watched it 2 dozen times or more and still enjoy it Being an old Navy guy Im still stirred by the rousing rendition of Anchors Away I also love the McHales Navy pirate atmosphere I could have done without the female dive officer but Im just old fashioned I guess She was still good to look at lol espesially after the crew got done with her laundry The cook sonarman and electrician made the movie Loved the salty old engineer and his first class PO too And Grammer actually did a very commendable job of being a misfit Officer I loved the driving scene as they passed the golf course on the way into port lol Pure Navy And I swear I had an XO that was just like that little weasel Im am so glad this is out on DVD about bloody time 0
1,This is probably my favourite TV show ever I love all the characters especially Alex who is the PERFECT woman Always makes me laugh and feel good when I watch this show There is just something about it that is amazing hard to describe It seems some or all of the episodes synchronise with music albums as well Here are a few examples The episodes start again when they end  but DONT play end credits until the very end but always play the opening credits With most the episodes the album plays once and the episodes play twice but some go on further RADIOHEAD PINK FLOYD BOB Dylan 202 Double bogey Kid A  OK Computer episode plays at least 4 times 214 Saturn Kid A  Meddle  Shot Of Love 219 World without Alex Kid A  Wish You Were Here  Pablo Honeyepisode plays at least 4 times There are clues in the episodes which tell you which albums synchronise Kid A may synchronise with EVERY episode
1,This movie gives us some WWII history along with some touching romance a little fantasy and meaningful emotion  and beautiful scenery Nicholas Cage never fails us and here again does a great job And so do the other principle characters One key charater the physicianfather played by John Hurd delivers to his daughter one of the best definitions of love Ive ever heard Some of the events are a bit too coincidental to be real but I excused that knowing that this is partly fairy tale and fantacy My wife and I really liked the film And it is nice to watch people taking the risks to love the enemy One man who left the theatre near us said to his wife Now thats the way to wage war I think youll see what he means when you watch the Italian occupiers of this lovely Greek island
1,Spheeris debut must be one of the best music documentaries of all time And as far as I know its also the only one that focuses on the LA Punk Explosion of the early eighties Its all there not just great great bands like Black Flag Fear X the Germs whose names may not mean much to you today but whose influence on todays alternative rock music can not be overestimated but also the promoters the media and first of all the audiences  the punks  all portrayed in a manner that makes you laugh shudder and gasp with astonishment about the energy the anger and the fury these youths put into their music Where is that today The eighties may have sucked big time when it cames to mainstream music but the underground was rocking If you need a proof for that watch Fears performance in Decline Unmatched Great film How come this is not available on vid LD or DVD PS The followup Decline Pt II is hilarious too
1,When I saw Lon Chaney Jr and Boris Karloff in the cast I was expecting to find a typically schlocky 1950s style horror movie The opening scene a graveyard with a wolf howling in the background seemed to confirm this Once I began watching it though what I discovered was a nifty little mystery about an Englishman Richard Green seeking to discover what had happened to two of his friends who had disappeared in the Black Forest and if necessary to take revenge against the evil Count Stephen McNally who ruled the territory Chaney as the voiceless Gargon had a rather limited role one which reminded me of the Hunchback of Notre Dame actually while Karloff had a somewhat more substantial role as Dr Meissen In fact Meissen was one of the more interesting characters in the movie and it was difficult to know until the very end whether he would be established to be a good guy or a bad guy The castle set was magnificent and even the limited depiction of the Black Forest was real enough It certainly didnt come across as lowbudget compared to other movies Ive seen anyway The only disappointment I thought was Rita Cordays performance as the Countess She seemed somewhat dry and didnt seem to put much passion into the role That aside I found that this movie held my attention throughout and there was enough suspense about how this was all going to turn out to make it well worth the watching Definitely recommended with a 710 rating
1,My curiosity and patience to finally see this controversial film which now has been released on DVD for the first time in the UK has been more than rewarded Peter Watkins has excelled himself in his audacity and technical skills This pseudodocumentary is certainly ahead of its time and still frighteningly relevant and up to date The film is inspired by the upheaval of the late sixties in the US when the government has increased its legitimized use of violence and oppression while the antiwar movement reacts increasingly violent and radical In order to deal with both this the overpopulation of prisons and to provide special training to riot police units the government has introduced the socalled punishment parks Convicted criminals mostly activists are given the choice to either be locked up in prison for years and years or spend three days in one of these parks where they either gain their freedom their death or an even longer prison sentence The situation in the parks is beyond their worst expectations however It reminded me of a sort of realistic version of Battle Royale 2000 The films structure is extremely effective and recalls parallels with Cannibal Holocaust which is made almost 10 years later Both movies are constructed and filmed in such a way that the viewer is challenged in thinking and feeling he is actually watching a real documentary and therefore shocked even though aware of the fact that this is a film Both confront us with the inherently violent nature of mankind but where Cannibal Holocaust is devoid of any deeper meaning above all it is an exploitation movie in every sense of the word and does not raise any critical questions about the state of the world Punishment Park does just that I have been profoundly impressed with Punishment Park and find it hard to believe how such a powerful and important film could have been rejected and marginalized for so long Maybe that says enough about the truth of its content about the way power structures in this world function I do not agree with the critique that Watkins polarizes and stereotypes because the movie depicts activists and the keepers of the legitimized power structures who are in reality as polarized as they are here If they werent there would not be any conflict and therefore no change in our societies In reality confrontations between these two groups often take stereotypical forms whether you place them between activists and establishment in Latin America Russia or New York City If these groups would not be polarized to these extremes the activists would be part of the silent majorities that tacitly complain but at the same time reside in the injustices of the world As Peter Watkins tells us in the introduction on the DVD the actors in Punishment Park are for the most part amateurs Most kids were real activists from LA most policemen had been part of the national forces and even some of the members of the tribunals are part of the social and political establishment of the time Not introducing both groups previous to the shooting of the scenes taking place in the improvised court room adds to spontaneous and improvised feel Parallels are drawn with issues of the time such as the repression of Black Panther members one of the black prisoners is said to resemble the convicted charismatic BPleader Bobby Seale and the trial of the Chicago seven I admire Watkins obvious and sincere engagement with injustice and his concern with human rights and the increasingly repressive measures taken by governments nowadays in the name of the War in Terror to silence those that do not agree and refuse to be brainwashed Punishment Park remains to be an extremely important movie that should be shown in schools and seen by everybody who shares these concerns Maybe its marginalization can finally be made up for
1,I was stunned by this film Afterwards I didnt even want to see any films for a long time any other film would be so unsatisfying by comparison For many it may be the worst of Antonioni very slow without an engaging conventional story line microscopic examinations of human emotions and interactions and the worst of Wenders verbose confused transcendentalism It is composed of short distinct episodes linked by Wenders typical meandering heros stream of consciousness so it doesnt produce the temporary oblivion of escapist cinema But for fans the worst is the best and the disjointed story line is sketching a single poetic image that stretches across the film Wenders and Antonioni create a discourse between their segments that seeks out the heart of things 
1,Another must have film Henry Brandon is a favorite I was so surprised when I learned years ago that he was from Germany because he sounds  looks so typically American And wasnt he great in The Searchers as Chief Scar Another of my favorites I have it  watch it over  again Now if I could add this one to my collection it would make my day This is a great wildlife story  film for all ages The scenery is so absolutely beautiful  the plight of the endangered snow leopards is told with such great emotion it will spark the interest in endangered species in anyone especially children If I could I would give a copy to all of my grands  great grands
1,I always knew the day was coming We all knew Theres only so much oil in the ground and one day well run short But isnt there supposed to be enough coal to use instead And wind power or something Things for future generations to worry about Then this documentary hit me smack between the eyes Oil makes the fertilizer that is the reason for the first time in world history practically no one lives on farms When the inevitable oil shortages hit a lot of things  air travel many drugs plastics life in the suburbs  will become impossible But the craziest insight from the documentary is this oil gives us so much energy with so little effort that without it our lives must change Even if substitutes and conservation are implemented immediately at best theyll smooth our landing into a strange postoil world which the documentary claims could be starting NOW Despite its gloomy message the documentary is often highly entertaining It contains fabulous historical footage sober images of dark urban factories and campy funny stuff from the 1950s which reminds us of why we moved to the suburbs in the first place It also offers hope that a massive effort started now could both ease our transition from oil and make the world a better place My only complaint about the documentary is that it does not spend time on the mystery of why we are finding this stuff out now How can this be a big emergency all of a sudden We knew in the 1970s we should be preparing for a postoil world  and we started to prepare with alternative energy research and smaller cars If our failure to follow through on President Jimmy Carters initiatives 25 years ago has doomed us to a hard landing in a postoil world why was no one shouting about it on soapboxes In the end I found the documentary highly persuasive and it left me with the terrible chill of being dragged out of a very lovely dream This is must viewing for everyone not afraid to face a very likely near future that we still have time to do something about  Charles
1,Bride of Chucky is one of the better horror movies to come out in the past ten years and could be one of the best horror films of the 90s SPOILERS Chuckys girlfriend Tiffany Jennifer Tilly manages to find his battered remains after being sucked into the fan at the end of part 3 and brings him to life in her trailer park Her neighbor Jessie Nick Stabile and his girlfriend Jade Katherine Heigl are being tormented by her uncle John Ritter Tiffany upsets Chucky when he refuses to marry her so she buys a doll for him to play with Chucky kills Tiffany and then transfers her soul into the doll she got him In order for them to be placed back into human bodies they have to travel to New Jersey to retrieve an amulet to do so Jessie sees this as an opportunity to escape from Ritter and they set out on the journey but not before Ritter is killed by Chucky and Tiffany Along the way several bizarre incidents force them to stop at a bed and breakfast When several more people are killed they call up their best friend Gordon Woolvett to straighten out the situation They convince him neither one of them are the killers as the police have began to solve the crimes He finds Ritters body in a trunk in the back of the van Thinking he has been set up he confronts them about it Chucky and Tiffany then turn real to prove they did it which gets Woolvett killed The group steals a motor home and arrives at the cemetery Jessie and Jade get Chucky and Tiffany to turn on each other giving them enough to escape Chucky recaptures Jade and forces her to get his amulet Chucky and Tiffany restart their feud which gives Jessie and Jade enough time to kill the both of them as the police arrive and clears them of the crimes The Good News I have to give the most amount of props to the FX department as Chucky and Tiffany as dolls look completely convincing The scenes with them together are the movies main highlights including a hilarious conversation where Tiffany advises Chucky on how serial killers in the 90s work That being said the amount of oneliners in this movie that are actually funny is incredible Chucky gets the most of them but Tiffany cracks a few gems as well It is actually funnier than what Hollywood calls comedies these days The gore is plentiful and shockingly realistic Several deaths in this movie are actually original and creative Turning Ritter into a new form of Pinhead was a totally brilliant scene The honeymooning couple was a nice death scene as well For teenage love the pairing of Stabile and Heigl works great They have a great chemistry together and actually behave like a normal couple I also have to admit that the first time I saw this movie I did jump during certain scenes and that shows what an incredible job director Yu did He learned enough apparently to do the same thing with Freddy vs Jason He knows how to stage setups and payoffs and here he shows some great skills that have a Hong Kong influenced look and style He could be the next great horror director if he keeps filling up his resume with films like those two Nice soundtrack too like Freddy vs Jason The Bad News For fans of cheesy movies this will be a great find However this film has a high cheese factor that may prevent the serious horror movie fan from having a good time enjoying this film The film knows it is a cheesy movie and revels in it making a serious fan turned off because of things like the oneliners It isnt all that bad of a movie but it has to be watched in the mind frame that it is a cheesy movie and that the cheesiness of certain scenes add to the movie not to take it away Remove yourself from that state of mind and you may find yourself enjoying this movie The Final Verdict Fans of cheesy movies and the other Childs Play movies will find a lot to like about this movie For serious horror fans take a look at it but keep in mind that it isnt a serious movie and that the cheesiness is supposed to be there and you might find yourself liking it Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language Brief Nudity on a doll a shadowy puppet sex scene some drug use and numerous drug references
1,This short film certainly pulls no punches The story is of a butcher who wrongfully kills an innocent man who he believes has sexually molested his retarded daughter The film goes onto depict how the butcher serves his time and returns to life with his daughter in care and having to come to terms with a life with no future The graphic opening scenes of a horse being slaughtered and the full frontal birth of the butchers daughter puts you a brutal frame of mind that stays with you throughout the film The snappy flow of the film is very direct and adds to its brutality Consequently alot of ground is covered in the 40 minutes You are taken in fully with the butchers nonlife  particularly after he loses his daughter to social services and his business His story continues in the excellent film Seul Contre Tous
1,This isnt far away from the trash that Bollywood normally makes but theres just something really good about it The title song is one of Bollywoods best and is haunting throughout This is one of the films along with Baazigar  a must see Bollywood film that made Shah Rukh Khan and its for this you have to check it out Other reviews give away the story  it is a fairly basic idea  ShaRukh definitely stands out and one of his final expressions right at the end made me give this film an extra star Its fairly cheesy but definitely worth watching if you are new to Bollywood or not 810
1,Between the ages of 30 and 51 when he died of a brain tumour Zachary Scott made 70 films He was introduced in 1944 in Jean Negulescos The Mask of Dimitrios where he played Dimitrios The next year 1945 he made three films of which this is one He is best remembered by cineastes as the star of Jean Renoirs The Southerner one of the 1945 films where he had a sympathetic role However he often played creepy characters and in this film he is a sociopathic killer of women for money So what happens here He lives in a house with three women so watch out Faye Emerson who also appeared in Dimitrios plays the older of two daughters in the house She falls in love with Scott and they become secretly engaged Then her cute kid younger sister played effectively by Mona Freeman who resembles Bonita Granville both in looks and in behaviour returns from boarding school and reveals casually in conversation with Scott that she has inherited a tidy sum so Scott turns his sights on her instead with all the torrid jealousies seething in the household which that was bound to arouse Things get tense and then they get tenser Meanwhile plans for murder are going forward in the mind of the calculating Scott But it turns out that he is not the only one with such intentions He is also being searched for as a result of his last kill with which the film has opened so that we know his back story James Wong Howe gives effective noirish cinematography to this tale which was directed by Frenchman Robert Florey who had moved to Hollywood some time earlier The film is an effective psychopathinthehouse mystery which can cause a bit of wear of the edges of some seats for those of such an inclination
1,ONE DARK NIGHT is a highly overlooked and little known film from the early 80s that deserves an audience that I fear it will never get and thats a damn shame I have seen this film compared to others that have gotten a bigger name over the years most notably PHANTASM HELL NIGHT and MAUSOLEUM This is a much different film than those and I dont see the comparisons other than the mausoleum which is a bit similar to the one in PHANTASM but not enough to make any real comparisons Im not sure how this one slipped through without a broader acceptance Maybe its all in the marketing I dont know Perhaps a remake would breathe new life into it unless Raymar drained all the life out of it that is Im not too big on all the remakes that are abundant these days but I think they do work well with lesser known films except for the awful GHOST SHIP remake which other than the opening scene and Mudvaynes Not Falling blaring was utter crap So if a remake of ONE DARK NIGHT would happen to fall into the right hands I think it would make a lot of people go and watch the original I know thats what I do if theres a remake of a film I havent seen before So anything short of a remake I fear would not bring this film back to life Unless of course Raymar got his eyes on it Anyways ONE DARK NIGHT is a must see for horror fans especially 80s horror fans cause we all know thats when the best horror movies were made Creepy setting Fairly good acting Very good story Campy What more could you want from an early 80s horror film Whats that nudity and gore Well sorry No nudity or gore in this film but its still great nonetheless A solid 8 out of 10 Enjoy
1,I recently read the story to see how these two match up and if you can believe it this film improves upon Balzac The story is moved around I think to drive home the idea that Colonel Chabert is a man who has suffered much and yet he comes home not a hero but as an outcast As someone mentioned I was initially confused if Chabert was akin to The Return of Martin Guerre No It is firmly established by Balzac that Chabert is the real deal Whats interesting though is not is he isnt he but how his wife and society treats him I think this is a timeless story of men who go off to fight for their country and when they come home time has left them behind Chabert is a tragic figure made all the more poignant by the amazing Gerard Depardieu I dont care that hes been in 1 million films hes captivating Fanny Ardant has a horrible character to play Once a prostitute Rose has used her feminine wiles to climb the social ladder Are her emotions true for Compte Ferraud I think they are and perhaps couple that with her social standing at the time and you start to feel some empathy for her Fabrice Lucini is slowly worming his way into my heart Hes exceptional here as Derville I think if you can get your hands on this gem of a film you wont be sorry French cinema at its finest
1,The two new OSS 117 movies has a kind of humor which is both intelligent and dumbeddown at the same time which I find extremely amusing It really reminds me of the classic Pink Panther movies with an almost as good leading man as Peter Sellers in Jean Dujardin And unlike Steve Martin completely ruining Clouseau Dujardin is quite brilliant The comments regarding the movies being antisemitic are obviously a case of a complete lack of humor and therefor understanding Whether you will enjoy or hate this movie really comes down to what kind of humor you have I cant wait for the sequel
1,This movie is Wonderful I can watch it again and again Robin hood is Perfectly cast and Marian is beautiful I personally think Marians German man is the funniest character along with Latrine and the Sheriff While space balls got boring and stupid after a while this one always keeps your interest W O N D E R F U L This was a great film and never gets boring A great cast is in the roles and it is spoofed perfectly and makes so much sense and can be watched again and again You will love this film if youll only watch it except if you hate comedy or does not think Robin Hood should be tampered with But this old story gets boring and this movie gives it a great new flavor
1,The Love Letter is a somewhat pleasant very very lowkey romantic comedy in which the use of just the right few words in a mysterious love letter unlocks the secret passions and longings of a sleepy seaside towns inhabitants Its not for all audiences The Love Letter I feel benefits from its simple and quiet tone Never intentionally wacky and phony like most romantic comedies its quaint picturesque and comfy However for these exact same reasons many viewers will be bored and disinterested The cast is nice Its great to see Tom Selleck again and is such an underplayed role And its hard to believe this is the same Kate Capshaw we met 15 years ago in Indiana Jones and the Temple Of Doom Shes quite naturally good here improving in every role Ive seen her in since grating on Indys nerves And is it possible Capshaw is just getting lovelier and lovelier with age   What is it about that Spielberg It doesnt amount to much but after another noisy summer movie season Ill probably look back with brief fondness for this lightasafeather romance
1,I was surprised as I watched this movie how much it had encaptured me No the actors didnt act like typical Hollywood actors but thats not always bad either as this film proves Quite different from the Disney standard it is a refreshing turn nonetheless They also give you a taste of what it was probably like without being educational A movie everyone should both see and enjoy Many people love arguing over accuracies in any movie of this type but just getting the basic idea has plenty to offer Mild gripe East and West Germany viewed on any map would have West Germany on the left side East to the right The movie at times sets you back slightly because about half of the scenes have West Germany on the right side of the screen and other times on the left side Even during the same events they shift back and forth Perhaps just a little more consistency would have avoided this mild distraction Go See It
1,Mr Baseball was a fun video rental with my Fiancé Susan Nauss Susan said that she had been looking forward to seeing the movie Ken Takakura Oda as a tough yet Honorable Manager makes sense Ken Takakura has made so many wonderful Asian movies I correct the one reviewer and say Takakura is still a Cinematic Presence with films like Hotari Of course everyone likes Tom Selleck yet Ken Takakura is the better dramatic actor of the two Today someone accused me of being Yakuza well I say that My Great Uncle Shadow President Jack F Kennedy myself and others are part of the legitimate Human leadership in our Universe and thanks to our coCreators Humans are free people fighting all the parts of adversity that President Kennedy talked about in his inaugural address To be honest someone has kept food prices very low in Canada on things like bread In honor of our CoCreators please stop eating amphibians reptiles and eggs I hope that there will one day be a sequel to Mr Baseball with Father Ken Takakura Oda still as Manager Thank you to IMDb for supporting freedom of speech like the kind President George W Bush and I support Support IMDb
1,Charles Bronson is back in his most famous role In my opinion this is by far the best film of the series and my favorite movie ever This movie doesnt take itself seriously because the filmmakers knew that all the social commentary that was necessary was put across in the first film Golan and Globus made this film for Bronson fans not for the critics and it works DW3 has been unfairly criticized as trash and a weary entry in a worn out series These statements would be true if the film was made to be taken seriously or to spread a statement but it wasnt If you take it as what it is DW3 is just a fun action packed romp with Charlie doing to street punks what we all wish we could do The action is non stop the atmosphere is great and the movie is just out and out the best Bronson flick ever made You can tell that the penny pinching Cannon group spent a lot of money on this one It is believed that Bronson thought this film was too violent and that was the reason why Winner didnt direct any of the following entries I can understand his concern but as is always the case of sequels you have to push the envelope even further to pass a previous entry In any case this movie was no more violent than any other movie made during this time What makes DW3 the best of the series and my favorite film ever not the best just my favorite is the action Charlies presence memorable villains and its ability to get the viewers to jump on the bandwagon The first film may be the most technically well made but this one is the most fun For once Charlie actually has some clever lines although he doesnt say muchand a halfway interesting story photography action and direction to back him up Charlie has never been more intense or super cool than in this one Yes its exploitive maybe it does promote stereotypes and maybe it is the same story as before but Bronsons films always have and always will stand for defending the common man and giving his audience what they want to see Many argue that the DW series manipulates its audience my reply is that the movies dont manipulate us the fans are the ones in charge We demand that Bronson blow away deserving scum and in turn Winner and Co deliver the goods And for those of you who still want to put it down remember a few things DW3 was the 1 movie in America when it came out and was among the viewing favorites of millions of people on video and television because they realize that not all films have to be epics they just have to be fun 10 You cant get any better John Batchelor
1,Barbara Stanwyck is a sheer delight in this wartime comedy about a sailor invited to spend Christmas with a popular magazine writers family at her farm in Connecticut The problem is she has no husband baby or farm as she writes about in her column and she cant even cook her wonderful recipes being provided for her by her good friend  Uncle Felix owner of a Hungarian restaurant in New York City Things get even more complicated when her strict publisher boss invites himself along for Christmas A scheme is hastily planned with her stuffy fiancé providing an actual Connecticut farm neighbors providing a borrowed baby and a quick wedding planned when the publisher isnt looking But when the handsome young sailor arrives on Christmas Eve romantic complications ensue as the supposedly married author falls like a ton of bricks for the nice guy Navy man and vice versa This is a charming warm film that deftly balances humor with sentiment and is a wonderful showcase for Barbara Stanwyck to display her considerable comedic talent aided by such marvelous character actors as Sydney Greenstreet Una OConnor SZSakall and many others A Christmas night dance at the town hall is a toe tapping delight to see and the unexpectedly sweet and feminine side of Stanwyck is a wonderful surprise for viewers who have seen her mainly as tough bitchy women in femme fatale roles Truly a wonderful film that has stood the test of time
1,Though this is a good enjoyable cartoon they did much better ones later on like Carrotblanca This is almost like the first Star Trek feature which would have been welcomed with open arms and glee no matter what just for existing This is really a patchwork of old bits with some nice touches but nothing special Reminds me a bit of the hunting trilogy in spots and the ending is priceless Available and certainly well worth watching just for the novelty and the good bits Recommended
1,CIA analyst Douglas Freeman Gyllenhaal gets to see his first secret location interrogation when Anwar Metwally is accused of having contact with a known terrorist bomb maker Anwars wife Witherspoon is frantic regarding the whereabouts of her husband  Dont you just hate it when the title of a movie sends you to a dictionary I must have an old edition as this Rendition is not a musical piece No its the governments way of legally taking a resident or citizen somewhere to interrogate him and possibly use some torture to get the desired information  While watching this movie I was reminded of a similar story line in the Crossing Jordan TV show now off the air and I expect we will see even more of these story lines Its inevitable The events of 911 are the catalysts  This is a tough one to watch because we dont like to see people tortured and our government not telling the truth about things We like the idea that no matter what happens or happened that we can go somewhere to find answers but when that door is closed to us we are truly lost and without hope as Anwars wife was  Performances by all were first class and its possible we may see more of Igai Naor I have no idea how to pronounce it because he resembles and can act like Telly Savalas No kidding  Violence Yes Sex No Nudity No Language Yes
1,When I saw this on TV I was nervouswhats if they messed it up Millions of families like mine that live with a brain damaged man in my case my Dad would be let down I watched it with my Mum and we both ended up crying it was so accurate and captured how the family feels as well as the person having suffered the brain injury The actors were all wonderful and I had no complaints my Mums told me she hasnt been able to stop thinking about it I hope this program made many people aware of what its like living with brain damage and what its like for the families More programs like this should be made I was surprised at how good it was and its really shook me up emotionally
1,Homegrown is one of those movies which sort of fell through the cracks but deserves better When I first saw it I had a lukewarm reaction But over time its really grown on meno pun intended  The more I see it the more I appreciate it The writing is topnotch as is the acting Throw in a few surprising cameos and good direction and you end up with a great little film Its also good to finally see Hank Azaria get a chance to shine in a starring role And Thornton delivers his usual quality performance Even relative newcomer Ryan Phillippe delivers playing a friendly innocent with wit and subtlety On a side note Homegrown is simply a must see if youre a Billy Bob Thornton fan It appears Stephen Gyllenhaal was influenced by earlier Thornton projects like One False Move and Sling Blade though Homegrown is certainly a lot more tongueincheek than either And Thorntons role as a character who is both sophisticated and downtoearth is a perfect match for the actor
1,Caught this recently after noticing James Earl Jones name on the title It was better than I expected Of course its pretty old  made during the earlymid 70s but it actually is a decent drama It runs a quick 90min or so and showcases good performances from James Earl Jones and Diahann Caroll The plot is conventional in general but told through the perspective of a single black woman on welfare who has 6 children and trying to deal with all the problems that persist This makes for an interesting viewalso in the fact that the script wasnt too sentimental or overdramatized  its almost like looking at a slice of the past All the 70s styles are out in abundance The ending is kind of kooky thoughprobably wouldve done better without the theatrics
1,There are one or two other Shempera shorts I like more ie SCRAMBLED BRAINS but I think one can saywithout much argumentthat in this particular episode Shemp gives his greatest comedic performance as a stooge after rejoining the team in 1946 Scene for scene this episode hardly lets up from Professor Shemp Howards voice lessons with the glassshattering Dee Green to his futile attempts to win a dames hand in marriage this is your little snookums will you marry me click to the uproarious finish it never fails to keep me in stitches I would be remiss not mention that immortal scene with Miss Hopkins the always lovely Christine McIntyre Btw isnt she rather underdressed and over amorous in greeting the man she thinks is her Cousin Basil Who knows maybe the actual Basil was a very distant cousin which makes it legal in some states as far as I know 
1,A good entertainment but nothing more  in this western we are between the classics and the spaghetti ones This provides us a good a conventional story but its always a pleasure to see Robert Mitchum with his legendary flegma although he isnt as fit as in the forties or the fifties And dont forget David Carradine is the son of John Carradine
1,This movie was awesome if you want a movie with nonstop puns and laughter then this is right for you This movie was great because it took the serious Robin Hood and made it something the whole family can enjoy and get a good laugh at I first viewed this movie when i was around 10 and got most of it This movie is also great because it makes fun of everything involved By order of the kings financial secretary H and R Blockhead Everyone needs a little Cary ElwesRobin Hoodin life whether or not its Liar Liar with the Claw or Saw  This movie is worth watching
1,The Muppet Movie  directed by  James Frawley Kermit the Frog and friends relive the tales and stories of how they all came together The Muppets star in their first feature film bringing the magic they are known for to a bigger picture The story is not too complex and is written as a prequel of sorts The well written jokes appear as each character gets a worthy introduction The cameos arent just thrown in either but written in as interesting characters making one of the many peaks for our furry friends
1,The movie I received was a great quality film for its age John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film
1,This has to be one of the best movies we have seen and we highly recommend it for its exposure of the injustices of bigotry Billy Wirth is an incomparable actor and truly awesome as CorbyWhite Wolf However felt the story would have been enhanced if his character had more scenes This is a movie that can be watched over and over without tiring
1,If you value your freedom I first got seriously interested in The Branch Davidian debacle after reading an article in UK journal The Fortean Times Wanting to learn more I rented this documentary and after watching it I was stunned at what I saw This film peaked my interest in the subject and I have read several books on the subject since then This film is a must see for people who only know the facts as reported in the so called mainstream media The baldfaced lies double talk and contradictory statements made by officials and politicians shown in this film will make you think twice about calling people who question the governments actions in this fiasco nuts loonies and kooks  Whats scary is that I know some people who consider themselves open minded intellectuals and freedom loving liberals who are still convinced that the government did the right thing at Waco and refuse to watch this film or read any of the books on the subject They continue to insist its not worth their time because its all propaganda from gun loving Clinton hating religious fanaticright wing anarchist nuts One publication from an organization comprised of many so called great minds that claims to be dedicated to promoting reasoncommon sense and rationalism condemned the film claiming it would poison peoples minds and strongly suggested this film should be suppressed They even hinted the Davidians had it coming I wont mention its name since Im a coward If you are one of those reading this of course you probably would not be reading this anyway I can only say its a shame you wont open your mind
1,This movie was a suprise for me while I was surfing from channel to channel I dont know why but it filled in me with warmth and happiness This is what a high budget movie can not do mostly I liked it this is a must see one 
1,I wonder why I havent heard of this movie before Its truly a magnificent comedy Id say farce but its too well acted and Id hate to denigrate its quality A comedic character study about the travails of midlife crises the inequity for gays who cant have their longtime unions recognized and the general differences of people who cant fit nicely into society that pairs Kathy Bates and Rupert Everett to a wonderful effect Forget Julia Roberts and Rupert Kathy Bates and Rupert should do another movie together The anxietyridden acerbic and outrageous daughterinlaw Maudie Meredith Eaton is a truly wonderful character If you liked the Tales of the City films youd like this quirky charmer
1,Is this a good movie No certainly not But for Jolie lovers its musthave Her nonpolished acting and seminudity scene will please her fans for ages to come The current rating however 32 is too low The movie might lack a good storyline and isnt a great sfmovie altogether but the acting is good enough and like mentioned before Jolies acting is nice and raw the movie is shot very direct with a lot of closeups The scenery is bizarre And last but not least leaving van Damme out was a very good choice Presumably non of the Jolie lovers would like to see her having sex with him This movie has all the potential of becoming a cult movie
1,Junior high and high school teachers will find The Cure an excellent teaching tool both as a companion to Huckleberry Finn or as a standalone lesson Although AIDS is supposed to be the main theme the strong suptext of friendship and love as they evolve between Eric and Dexter is a powerful message for teenagers Writing prompts centered around the symbolism of the tennis shoe are particularly effective I also suggest directed class discussion about how Eric evolves from manipulative user to loving friend
1,I watched the movie with tears and smiles alternatively Anger surged in me to see the ruin of Hanoi after the 12day bombard And by living in the country right now with my parents whos been living in Saigon for 50 years I understand that were much better off now and would have been better if the American didnt bring war here Watching the movie I learned more of the different kinds of wars that the America planned in Vietnam and what disasters they caused The series seems to do well with the interviews with the real people But I dont like it that some people only give generic opinions like the analyst near the end of the series I forgot his name There should also be more documentary images like the life in the army camp of the South Vietnam and those of the North if possible Theres also a sudden change from the year of 1972 to 1975 Im not sure if the inbetween was censored because I watched this series on TV
1,This is a great TV movie with a good story and many comic moments thanks to the excellent cast The only problem this movie has is that it hasnt stood the test of time as well as it might have Despite this its definitely worth viewing particularly if you are an Alan Alda or Ruth Gordon fan
1,I love this film Ive seen it 1000 x on dvd and I cant say enough about it It has it all comedy awesome action and incredible stuntsfx Samuel Jackson steals the show here big time I dont think there isnt a moment that hes in that he isnt funny Everyone knows that when you make an assumption you make an ass out of you and umption The fx are great The bridgetruck explosion is incredible although the sound isnt all that greatWhen Samuel drives out of the truck the sound is off a little I think and what he says is priceless For those of you who own it on dvd put the audio in french Its halarious Even emotional moments are great when the bad guy discovers that SamsCharlies daughter is his is great This is a great film that no action fan can do without I also reccomend Cutthroat Island Aside from all the negative publicity it kicks
1,When the movie first started I thought cheesy The first ten minutes were really boring After the slow beginning and some of the soap opera antics I started liking it The plot was different than anything I had ever seen Now was it a horror Not really It shouldnt have been classied as a horror or the producers should have put more money into the movie to make it scary As it was the creatures where only there for a short time I can only assume this was for money reason The good side was that the movie was very entertaining It held my interest after the start and did make me wonder about creatures from another dimension It was obvious that this was a first time movie for the director but there were a couple of highlights By the end I was hooked Too bad Hollywood didnt put more money behind this
1,Skenbart takes place in the 1940s right after the second world war Main character Gunnar Gustav Hammarsten quits his job to get a chance to make a difference in the bombedout postwar Europe He packs a book by his favourite philisopher Ludwig Witgenstein and embarks on a trip which will eventually prove Witgensteins famous statement true Nothing is what it seems There are two main plots and several subplots to this film which takes place on a train bound for Berlin WriterDirector Peter Dalle also playing the role as the conductor of the train has assembled an impressive cast including swedish legends Lena Nyman Gösta Ekman and Robert Gustafsson Overall the acting is excellent Skenbart offers some rather twisted slapstick comedy combined with more subtle black humor like the nun who loses her faith and starts cursing violently Its like Killinggänget meets Peter Jackson Braindead Bad Taste in Schindlers List I laughed during most of the film and when i woke up the next morning i laughed even more An intelligent film for fans of Swedish comedy
1,Murder Over New York is one of the better Chan mysteries and Ive just seen this for the first time In this one Charlie Chan is visiting New York to attend a police convention At the same time people who are involved with aircraft plants are being murdered and he decides to help with the investigation along with his Number 2 son These murders turn out to be the results of sabotage at the aircraft plants and Chan helps to identify the murderer Charlie Chan is played well by Sidney Toler and the rest of the cast includes Sen Yung as his Number 2 son and Marjorie Weaver I rather liked this mystery and is worth having if you like this sort of thing Rating 3 and a half stars out of 5
1,If it wasnt meant to be a comedy the filmmakers sure goofed If they intended for it to be a comedy they hit the mark Our critic says Homegrown is a wonderful film filled with family values and community spirit recommends it for all audiences and says that he really liked Jamie Lee Curtiss performance It deserves a theatrical rerelease
1,This came as a huge surprise for me I had never heard of this movie when I first saw it and the title really pointed towards something else than a great terroristhostage situation at a high school Toy Soldiers has the best from its time period of the early 90s where action movies were lighthearted and very enjoyable The action is good the plot is interesting and way over the top the bad guy is a onedimensional hateful douchebag which is great Louis Gossett Jr is in it its simply a feelgood movie which I thoroughly enjoyed You cant go wrong with this one if you like action I give it a solid rating of 810
1,Now Ive seen many many Bgrade films in my 15 years of living and I must say that this was one of the better ones I personally enjoyed the real estate and the storyline but it did suffer from amateur acting although Adrienne Barbeau did give a decent performance as Lisa Grant Joseph Bottoms couldnt hold his part well enough to be considered good The other performance which really fit the film was that of Barry Hope Barney Resnick It begins with an eager real estate agent taking an Asian couple through a house only to find theres a dead girl in the shower of the showhome It progresses with detective speculating and introduces the key characters with reasonable grace I think that for any person whos in for a giggle at the overthetop drama the victim realtors provide during the overthetop gory scenes this truly is a gem XD Who am I kidding Its not that great but worth a watch if youre insanely bored
1,Ive seen this movie twice both times on Cinemax The first time in its unrated version which is softcore porn at its best and the second time in a trimmed down cut all the sex and most of the nudity out version which was entertaining in a typical beach movie sort of way The unrated version has a tremendous sex scene with Nikki Fritz a dude and a bottle of oil which is out of this world no pun intended Unfortunately in the trimmed version that scene is almost completely chopped out as are all the other sex scenes Rated or unrated it is still fun to watch all the siblings of bigger stars Stallone Sheen Travolta etc trying to act We also get appearances by Bqueen Linnea Quigley and Burt Ward Robin from the old Batman series
1,The show is GREAT No words to describe it Wonderful music Incredible dance The editors couldnt spoil it not because they were not thatbad but because the show is really thatgood The editors are compulsive cutters you cant see a scene without a cut for more than 15 secs Its OK to show various angles but those guys were working with multiple cameras for the first time in their lives and they will remind you of how many cameras they have every five seconds on average They manage to film the start of a jump with one camera then cut it in the middle and show the rest of it in another angle No matter how much they tried they couldnt spoil that wonderful show Its a must for dance and music lovers
1,Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be Terrible acting Implausible scenerios Ridiculous death scenes Creepy evilfornoreason villains The last 30 minutes of this movie just might be the best 30 minutes ever put on film especially in the scene where the decent hardworking citizens string chains across the street knocking down the evil bikers and then shoot them only to be joined by the neighborhood children  in celebration And how can I forget the elderly woman with the broom Shes sweeping out the scum And if thats not enough lets not forget how quickly the punks give up after Fraker is killed Im laughing just thinking about it I also love the death scene of Kerseys girlfriend He just walks away after seeing her get blown up Its little things like this that make Death Wish 3 such a bad movie And Im not even mentioning the bizarre soundtrack I watched this movie because of Martin Balsam who I seriously think is one of the finest character actors ever and whos own getting beaten up by the scum scene is hilarious and I walked away with a new favorite movie Thank you Death Wish 3 for making me laugh so hard Some other things I forgot to mention 1 The weird sound effect after Kersey says Cash when buying his used car Ha Its so evil sounding 2 MANDY Fraker Mandy Did the writers run out of tough guy names 3 The fact that the gangs apparently have a lend and lease thug exchange program I need some more guys And that Mandy has a working phone line in an abandoned building 4 At the end of the movie after Kersey blows up Fraker is it just me or does it look like the street gang is about to break into choreography as theyre giving up Just watch how in sync they are after the female punk gives the stop signal  I love this movie Nothing cheers me up like Death Wish 3
1,This movie is just brilliant SRKs acting is just amazing the end is so incredibly sad I cry every time I see this film its the kind you never get sick of and can see again and again an absolutely amazingly brilliant movie
1,The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are Blue The Blue State mentality This is supposed to get us off the hook for what iswas happening during the last few years in our country The USA It doesnt get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better as though we arent benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a US citizen gets just by being a US citizen  But Im so sick of bitching about this It doesnt do any good I havent taken much action lately and I wonder how many people have Maybe Im just down because my job was outsourced last month and now Im looking for work in the shrinking tech support field where most of the jobs are quickly going to India and other places overseas Im thinking that soon its not going to pay off to be a citizen here with the screwed up infrastructure and the shrinking job market and the obsession with war These days it seems like anyone who speaks out gets jumped and questioned about there patriotism Anyway back to this review USA The Movie is an obscure DVD that makes me realize that some people have taken action whether its through politics protesting or arts or media The filmmaker is obviously passionate knowledgeable willing to go outside the norm frustrated unique astute etc  I looked through the whole site thats linked to the DVD and got lost in all the articles essays etcthat are there The DVD does that too has references to different times views and historical points Sometimes someone does something out there
1,I remember seeing this one in the theatres when it came out having no idea what it was going to be about and being so pleasantly surprised that I vowed to buy the video when it came out  While I wont go too far into dissecting this film I will say that I gave it an 810 for all the reasons you can read in the other users reviews What I will say is this  The first 10 minutes of this film are incredible Its as close to a textbook audience grabber as Ive ever seen I once put this movie on at a party where everyone was winding down and getting ready to leave I just wanted to see what would happen if I showed them the first ten minutes Everyone who watched the opening stayed to the end
1,This isnt quite the best Canadian film ever IMO I wont get off track and name 3 or 4 better Just a couple of nights before Id seen The Bicycle Thief the highly rated Italian classic and there are some parallels Both filmmakers shot their film in a specific time and specific place with minimal resources in terms of sets and cast And the result in both cases is fascinating and a joy to watch for the realistic setting and characters alone The lingering shots over faces and landscape almost make this worth watching on its own That being said this one isnt quite in the same league as the Italian classic The movie is shot in a frigid barren Quebec asbestos mining town That frigidity is contrasted with the warmth of the people and the eye of the filmmaker Claude Jutra Basically what you get is a series of vignettes that are likely nostalgic recollections of Jutra  not ha ha funny  but poignant and probably sometimes difficult at the time but now warmed over with the patine of nostalgia The movie meanders there is little tension Somewhere around half to two thirds way through the story begins Everyone youve met to this point is involved and youve gotten to know these characters rather well so have a little patience at the outset The story is a good one it will leave you thinking and it involves sex love and death all the basic elements If you like Bergman Godard Truffaut all that kind of stuff you wont be disappointed by this
1,Hilarious clean lighthearted and quoteworthy What else can you ask for in a film This is my alltime number one favorite movie Ever since I was a little girl Ive dreamed of owning a blue van with flames and an observation bubble The cliché characters in ridiculous situations are what make this film such great fun The wonderful comedic chemistry between Stephen Furst Harold and Andy Tennant Melio make up most of my favorite parts of the movie And who didnt love the hopeless awkwardness of Flynch Dont forget the airport antics of Leons cronies dressed up as Hari Krishnas dancing chanting and playing the tambourineunbeatable The clues are genius the locations are classic and the plot is timeless A word to the wise if you didnt watch this film when you were little it probably wont win a place in your heart today But nevertheless give it a chance you may find that It doesnt matter what you say it doesnt matter what you do youve gotta play
1,Daniel Percivals Dirty War a BBC production made for television was shown recently on cable The film has a documentary style in the way it goes after the people that caused the near holocaust in one of the big metropolis of the world London In fact this film produced in 2004 is almost a cautionary tale of the events of the following year in which terrorists set explosive devices in the public transport that killed innocent people that were in the wrong place at the wrong time The film impresses for the pace the director and the production team gave to the project There are no dull moments in the movie as we watch the preparation by the terrorists and the people that are following their dirty work Although the inevitable happens its amazing just to think what would be the consequences if a real dirty bomb was planted in such a densely populated area The last images of the film have a chilling effect The mob scenes and the way the whole area is contaminated send shivers of fear thinking how it could possible happen anywhere
1,In my opinion dads army is thee best British sitcom of all time I believe that if you just watch one episode of the show you cannot judge in completely on that one episode this include the movie You must at least watch a series of this show get inside the characters become familiar with there surroundings and the situations which they are in When you become familiar with the show then it will start appealing to you Now the movie has a few changes to the series which is slightly disappointing but it still works Watch a series or two of the show first before you watch this Youll not be disappointed Good episode to watch is No Spring for Frazer
1,This production was quite good The usual fabulous scenery interesting quirky characters It was just so strange not to have Captain Hastings Miss Lemon and Poirots officeresidence so prominently featured in the original PBSBBC mysteries In the original series so much took place at the office Hastings reading the paper while Poirot exercises his little gray cells Miss Lemon pitching in whenever needed Poirot without Capt Hastings would be like Holmes without Watson  he can most certainly solve the crime but it is not as interesting And what would a Poirot mystery be without Hastings with his impeccable manners falling for some beautiful unattainable woman
1,This movie has a twist that caught me offguard It made me go over the scenes in my mind to see if there were any clues along the way Loved the gorgeous Roy Thinnes and Joan Hacketts skillful acting The beautiful haunting music stays with me as well as the intriguing story
1,All budding filmmakers should watch this movie  it is like a masterclass in digital film making in itself Some of the scenes look like they have been shot on much higher production values than what they really have been It is very encouraging that such a well crafted piece of work can be made on a low budget The acting is very good and the characters are very interesting particularly that of the lead boy John Kielty who manages to play a teenager experiencing difficulties whilst remaining really likable His beautiful but fading mother was also very well portrayed and the relationship between her and her boss was very intriguing This is a very quirky interesting piece and I will be looking for anything else made by the same team The director is certainly one to watch
1,Two Hands is an entertaining funny story about Australian lowlifes The screenplay contrasts the world of fast money and deadly acts with the inexplicability of fate and circumstance In a subtle way we are asked to ponder the concept that major events in our lives are sometimes generated without our being fully aware of the root causes The forces of fate and circumstance take Jimmy the main character into situations that bring about the realization of his shallow dreams and ultimately an understanding of a more personally promising world The clueless Jimmy portrayed with acumen by Heath Ledger is a kid who grew up without opportunity The high paying world of crime offers the greatest appeal to his blunted senses The love and help of friends guides him to a higher plateau The film is welldirected and wellacted The band of criminals teeter between likable and despicable keeping us interested in their crazy antics all through the film
1,A wonderful storyso beautiful toldso intense so whit no keyboard to describe I thinkgo see it feel itit tells a story about love romance warand be trail so wonderful so full of romance if you love romance see it if you dont love romance drama well skip it thats all I can I vote 10 out of 10 stars wonderful
1,My mom and I went to the Ft Worth Premiere mainly to see George Strait but ended up getting the chance to see the movie premier at Bass Hall What a wonderful beautiful film which not only depicts the beautiful Texas landscape but also had a great feelgood storyline It was well written directed and produced and my mom and I loved it from start to finish Thank you Jay for giving us the opportunity to be a part of the premiere of this wonderful movie It was a night we will never forget As if seeing the movie was not enough we also were fortunate enough to be sitting 4 rows in front of my favorite singer George Strait Thank you Thank you Thank you Keep up the great work and again thank you Debbie McClendon  Maureen Daugherty Ft Worth TX
1,I loved this movie OH MY GOSH This movie rocked so hard I found it amongst some old tapes and didnt know what it was and after having read the back of the cover to see what the summer had to say about it Which btw mentioned the fact that Elton John covered the soundtrack for the film more times than it mentioned what the film was actually about I thought it sounded interesting and I was even more interested in seeing it because it was an older film What controversy I thought to myself as I put the tape in the player I was curious I get And my expectations were certainly met I loved it I guess it is a really girly kind of movie but it was so sweet and adorable It was a beautiful romance although at times the directing reminded me of the camera work in The Graduate which I thought at the time of seeing it the director must have been on acid with some of the close ups they did OK so it wasnt entirely conceivable for these two kids to run off and live on their ownbut it could happenin a fantasy But the ending just sincerely ticked me off I was so mad with how they ended itit sort of leaves you hanging and I suppose they may address what actually happens to them in the sequelbut at the same time Im almost hesitant to see that since sequels are almost never as good as the first I totally recommend this movie to anyone sixteen and over Its an awesome movieAwesome
1,A very different Jerry Lewis film not like all those more famous films that everybody knows Lewis deals with the difficult task of WW II and National Socialism in Germany in a rather unconventional way But even more interesting and important he does it in a very unAmerican way And as with so many things in the world and especially in the film industry unAmerican means more sophisticated more subtle more intelligent or simply better That is the reason why the film was no success in the US but a very great success in Europe All in all Jerry Lewis has proven by this movie that he is able to do much more than simple slapstick comedy
1,More and more french cinema demonstrates thats the only one able to confront Hollywoods and to spend high amounts on money in their movies If Bon Voyage had been made in the USA no one would be surprised Perfectly set in France in the 40s when the Nazi invasion technically irreproachable and with some of the most international french actors Depardieu Adjani Ledoyen Bon Voyage centerers on two parallel stories an scientific and his disciple Ledoyen who tries to hide one of his discoveries a kind of water that may work as an atomic bomb from the Nazis and a poor guy in love with a well known actress Adjani which ends up in prison accused of a crime hes not committed in order to protect her  Bon Voyage seems to have been made in the old style without unnecessary camera movements and effects Without big turns in the plot As I said before regarding to the production itself theyve made a great job But the main problem with this movie is about the script Is it a spymovie A romantic comedy A spy comedy A comedy of intrigue Its not clear That makes Bon Voyage a little unbalanced When you think youre watching a comedy suddenly changes to another storyline a more dramatic one more slow I think they shouldve focused in one of the lines of argument the one about the spy plot and left the romantic parts in the background My rate 6510
1,Well Im a few days late but what the hell Anyways the word that best describes my reaction to See No Evil wasSURPRISE The film is actually pretty good There is definitely an ample amount of blood gore  action in the film with a modest amount of suspense It hearkens back to the good ole slasher days of the late 70s  early 80s Think Madman meets Leatherface with a dash of Norman Bates and youll get a good feel for this flick While SNE is thin on plot most horror films are it kind of makes up for it in the violencemethods of killing the gore suspense  the fact that Kane does a great job of playing the highly disturbed Jacob Goodnight The title of the film comes from the fact that Jacob plucks out the eyes of his victims using just his fingers  stores them in big jars Why Youll just have to watch it  see pun intended There are certain cinematic elements lifted from other horror films most notably Psycho TCM  Madman but theyre not blatant Finally SNE really doesnt go into territory we long timers havent seen before  granted SNE is no Pyscho or TCM 74 but it certainly merits a look imo  BloodStones Recommendation Take in a matinée showing of See No Evil Bloodstones Rating 7510
1,Samuel Fuller knows war and is one of the only directors in American movie history who could accurately portray the horrific experiences of it in a form like the motion picture His pessimism and idealism if that sounds a little odd to mix together work for him as a storyteller and at the same time hes always out to tell the truth however brutal or put into melodramatic constructs it can get Verboten however deals with the postwar experience as we only get in the opening scenes the big boom of WAR in bold for a point The opening shot is like one big exclamation point that seems to continue on into the rest of the scenes a dead soldier on the ground the camera pans up we see another soldier shot down in wartorn terrain Simple direct language Then Fuller punctuates the intensity with something interesting the title song played over the opening credits as both irony and sincerity and then Beethoven music over a shootout between Americans and the Nazis Sgt David Brent James Best is shot the battle goes on and then it transitions to him being treated for his wounds It might lead one to believe that this will be a somewhat conventional WW2 flick somewhat in that one usually wouldnt find Beethoven and later on to an extent Wagner put into these images but this isnt the case Instead Fuller makes this a Coming Home kind of movie though not at all in the sense that this soldier comes home injured and so on and so on Instead of really going home Brent stays on in Germany as hes fallen head over heels for the woman Helga Susan Cummings pretty good at pulling off the German accent and wants to work in a smaller capacity in the military so he can marry her What he doesnt realize is that a she wants him more for money so she can get food for herself and brother however this gets complex emotionally at the point of revelation to the slightly naive but heartfelt Brent and b theres an underground Hitler youth sect called the Werewolves who want to pick right up off where Hitler ended starting small despite argument within the group by attacking the very government thats now embedded in Germany to give them as Brent describes a blood transfusion With this plus footage from the Nuremburg trials and as narrated I think by Fuller himself a quick nopunchespulled history of the Nazi war crimes piece by piece we get a multifaceted look at a society in the dire straits of an immediate postwar environment While Rossellini handled it his own way with Germany Year Zero Fuller tackles it with layers first theres the love story or what is the tragic downfall of a man who cant see anything past what he thinks should be reasonable that its his wife and a child on the way that he cant leave until the revelation that hes partly been swindled Baker and Cummings along with Harold Daye as Helgas young confused brother perform at with the utmost detail to emotions these arent very easy Bmovie parts though they couldve been that Then another layer is the political one the struggle of a society to come to grips with being conquered and a mentality which is made sensationalized to be sure by Fuller in respect to making the Nazis a total nograyarea thing theyre evil particularly when they cancel out reason to meet their ends And finally theres the layer of style which is strangely absorbing This is probably one of Fullers talkiest films which isnt a bad thing considering its one of his best written scripts as the characters dont talk simply or in too many platitudes with the exception of a small scene where two characters talk about the Hitler youth as juvenile delinquents which is actually according to Fullers autobiography probably another layer to consider in the subtext and the 50s period of movies And Fuller shoots this almost in a real European style when hes not going for fight scenes or battles as the editing isnt always very fast and sometimes a cut wont happen for a full minute or longer Theres an odd tension that grows out of this especially when theres something said by a character that gets another one wildeyed or suspicious Fuller could easily go for a big closeup but theres a more sinister cold quality to not moving away from two people in a conversation without a simple overtheshoulder deal But when it requires it like the big brawl outside the American military office or the Nuremburg footage spliced into Franzs memories of the Werewolves Fuller can be as stunning stylist as ever Very hard to find but extremely worth it if your either a fan of the directors or of WW2 movies set in Germany or even just a historybuff Verboten is an intellectual experience and a strong emotional one with a cast that is better than expected from a Bmovie and an attitude towards the other that is equally damning and thought provoking
1,If you had asked me how the movie was throughout the film I would have told you it was great However I left the theatre feeling unsatisfied After thinking a little about it I believe the problem was the pace of the ending I feel that the majority of the movie moved kind of slow and then the ending developed very fast So I would say the ending left me disappointed I thought that the characters were well developed Costner and Kutcher both portrayed their roles very well Yes Ashton Kutcher can act Also the different relationships between the characters seemed very real FurthermoreI thought that the different plot lines were well developed Overall it was a good movie and I would recommend seeing it In conclusion Good Characters Great Plot Poorly WrittenEdited Ending Still Go See It
1,I just thought I would add another observation here While there are a couple of visual subreferences in this episode to the possibility of unexpressed feelings between Jim Kirk and Yeoman Janice Rand there is a special physically tender moment toward the end When the Enterprise is reversing at emergency warp speed in an attempt to outrun a possibly fatal Romulan plasma ball Janice perhaps fearing that their life is about to come to a dramatic end seeks comfort by placing her head on Jims sympathetic shoulder as they observe the aproaching instrument of their impending doom on the main viewer I thought it was sweet and Janice of course is gorgeous PS Goof Several times while supposedly firing phasors the film shows photon torpedoes being launched
1,I cant praise this film enough It had a lot of that handheld firstperson shaking camera which I love and some hate because it makes them sick like REC Cloverfield and Blair Witch Project It is a long movie for its kind but I didnt even notice because the film was so interesting By just showing the footage from a paranormal reporters work the movie keeps up the pace making it a realtime experience for the viewer While I would never call this film the scariest horror ever made Id have to say its certainly one of the best Ive seen The fear factor here is constructed by details in the images camera glitches events linked to one another which lend a very mysterious and haunting tone to the movie The horror is more in what is not shown but left to our imaginations The ending is perfect and be warned that you might have nightmares afterwards A second viewing is highly recommended though Watch this one alone in the dark dont expect anything and youll have fun
1,I have seen this play many times from Olivier to Branagh and this remains the one version that always stands out in my memory Many actors have captured aspects of this character but for me it is always Derek Jacobis performance they are compared to and all others just come up a bit short
1,This film is one of my fondest childhood memories Seeing the Muppets at the height of their popularity heading Hollywood singing and dancing with Miss Piggy googelyeying her beloved Kermit Fozzie Bear doing his best as everyones manager and a generous cast of extras delivering a film that turned out to be okey dokey Kermits melancholy ukulele number Rainbow Connection was nominated for an Oscar that year but was beat out by Norma Raes It Goes Like It Goes Ill pick Kermits song any day Get the kids and enjoy this timeless fantasysomeday theyll find it the rainbow connections the lovers the dreamers and me
1,I dont know what it is exactly but the film is happily sitting on my shelf with no thought of ever leaving meFulci has crafted one of the most ridiculous bizzare cheezinfested and well unique movies Ive ever seen Not sure what else to say about it but I LOVE THIS MOVIE The steak tartar scene is absolutely uproarious and the whole nazi torture orgy fiasco is strangely hilariousIm not sure what Fulci was trying to do but has anyone heard that based on this film Fulci accused Wes Craven of ripping him off with Scream Cat in the Brain is a must for bad movie lovers everywhereYes Ill definitely say its not a good film but I guarantee certain scenes will stick in your mind forever This is an exercise in craziness peopleI guess if I were a serious critic Id give it a 3 but on sheer enjoyability again I cant really explain my affections Id give it a 7Really whacked out flick
1,This movie is a gem It is the story of Juliette a perfectly ordinary cleaning woman who works in the large corporate office of a yogurt company and Romuald the president of same He takes no notice of her he takes no notice of anyone until several plots to wrest his company away from him all hit at the same time He is lost no one to turn to and no one to trust when he discovers Juliette As the cleaning woman no one pays any attention to her so they say and do incriminating things in front of her that she is smart enough to catch on to and use to help her helpless and hapless boss I have been keeping an eye out for years for the DVD of this and to see a previous comment about it being released in Sep 2007 raised my hopes Alas I cannot find a DVD does anyone know if there iswas one
1,The weakness of this comes from the confusing storytelling plots often coming out of nowhere But it really didnt matter because I still enjoyed it to its full length Once you actually accept that this movies not to be taken too seriously then youll enjoy it even more Its basically a love story a confusing one at first but as it evolves it really is something worthwhile Sure its been done so many times before but the complicated version of this is quite inspiring and touching The over the top fantasy and cgi was overwhelming at first but I still enjoyed its purpose And people quit whining about how it borrowed from other movies Guess what we know And it doesnt really matter because its purpose was to humour and entertain Sometimes people has to stop being so critical and think for a moment before they start yapping about Comparing this to Hollywood standards is utterly stupid and ignorant Its a totally different style and target audience As far as Im concerned some the best films Ive feasted my eyes upon are from eastern producers and directors Theres your Police story 4shaolin soccer kung fu hustle dragon tiger gate fist of legend hero crouching tiger etcI for one like this movie and haling from the Philippines US england Libya and now Australia Ill always be interested in these types of films Now try and judge my perception but I warn you I do see things from from the point of view of those 5 countries Ive lived in So you better be as experienced and open minded
1,A Three Stooges short this one featuring Shemp Of all those involving Shemp Ive seen this is my favorite performance by him in a Stooges short The basic plot is that Shemp must get married by 6 oclock that very evening if hes to inherit the half a million dollars a rich uncle left him in his will So Shemp sets out to get himself a bride but finds it a tougher road than expected that is until they learn of his inheritance money Best bits here involve Shemp shaving Shemp and Moe in a telephone booth and Larry on piano as accompaniment to Shemps voicetraining session Also the sequence where Shemp is mistaken as Cousin Basil and its outcome proves hilarious
1,I am a big follower of Indian Movies especially Malayalam and Tamil Shame on India for not sending this movie as their official Oscar entry I have seen this movie and it has clearly revealed to me the maturity Tamil cinema has in its screenplay and narrative which bollywood better catch up withBy the way to all we westerners Tamil Cinema is more qualitative and very different from Bollywood which is all about good looks glamour and promotion Coming to the point what was India thinking when they sent a movie like Devdas to the Oscars That was a really a Masochist move I think they are trying to punish Oscar judges with boredom by sending Devdas since the judges toppled Lagaan last year Devdas is just a brigthly colored but stale and predictable melodrama of Love fate and destiny I would keep away from it Anyway not sending a movie like Kanathil Muthital shows how much of a revamp Indian administration needs to save them from poor administrators who lack intelligence Now I know why this country has so many issues They are heavily talented but not showcased properly
1,Looking back at the career of Alfred Hitchcock it never fails to be surprising how such a brilliant and visionary man could be denied sufficient recognition for how revolutionary he was for the film industry It is likely a sign of how ahead of his time Hitchcock was always attempting to push the envelope and never coasting along with a film made simply for the purpose of being entertaining but always with a deeper more poignant motive on his mind Strangers on a Train one of Hitchcocks first and more underrated hits is a perfect example of these traits  an entertaining and suspenseful story even when viewed over 50 years later yes but so carefully and intelligently constructed it stands today as a masterpiece in film technique  Arguably one of the pioneering suspense thrillers Strangers on a Train may come across as slightly dated in certain aspects but it retains every bit of superbly crafted tension as it did back in 1951 if perhaps slightly less shocking The brilliant use of cinematography and lighting as well as quick careful editing are what really make the film stand out drawing out every possible iota of tension and retaining the audiences focus even in slower scenes If there was ever any doubt of what a simply masterful filmmaker Hitchcock was simply watching five minutes of Strangers on a Train should be enough to disavow such sentiments every shot is so carefully chosen and constructed all serving to drive the storyline ahead in a particularly innovative fashion Sadly enough there are certain moments in the story which are screechingly out of place enough to jar our focus away from the superb cinematography and editing  Bruno being able to reach down to the bottom of a sewer grate is simply unbelievable and the figure of a stereotypical old man crawling under a wildly out of control carousel provides unintentional comedic relief in what is meant to be the films most tense and engaging scene These are only brief moments but they are enough to stand out as painfully weak in an otherwise stellar film But what really makes Strangers on a Train stand out is the story premise As Hollywood films of late run the risk of descending inescapably further and further into the vat of turgid clichée after clichée its wonderfully refreshing to see a 50 year old film with a premise which actually comes across as smart and original Sure its fairly straightforward but the concept of swapping murders is simply one that would not fly in films of todays day and age which makes it all the more entertaining to watch the films brilliant screenplay keeps the action flowing at a swift pace while providing us with some wonderfully memorable lines all the while One cant help but notice the deeper themes Hitchcock is alluding to throughout as well especially the concept of darkness in humanitys heart demonstrated by elderly ladies being fascinated and exhilarated by the prospect of murder as well as Brunos own cavalier attitude towards death Hitch also works in many moments of dark humour Bruno popping a childs balloon with his cigarette is priceless and irony shooting suspenseful scenes in happy easygoing environments such as the iconic carnival scenes to create an even more eerie atmosphere This may be a suspense thriller yes but to overlook the brain concealed beneath it would be simply inexcusable  The antagonistic figure of Bruno essayed to perverse perfection by Robert Walker sadly in his last film role but easily stealing the film from his admittably very talented fellow cast members is without a doubt what makes Strangers on a Train so memorable as the character is a marvel to behold Here we have a simply superbly crafted villainous figure all the more intriguing by how ordinary and unassuming he seems Rather than cackling madly and thwarting the hero at every possible moment Bruno is a calm controlled psychotic mess He speaks of murder in such an offhand tone yet retains a passionate glint in his eye when discussing different fashions of killing people Bruno could seem to represent the Id as Freud would put it the inner darker and uninhibited aspects of mankind It makes an interesting contrast to the hero figure Guy Haines and how bland and uninteresting he seems almost as if to drive home the prospect of evil being much more interesting and appealing than constantly striving to do the right thing  Yet despite this implied message Hitch still twists our emotions enough that we root for Guy at every turn and cheer at each new obstacle he is forced to overcome Its a testament to actor Farley Grangers talent that despite Robert Walkers villain easily stealing the show Grangers hero still comes across as sympathetic still commanding our support even when falling prey to being a far less compelling character Superb support is given by Ruth Roman who manages to overcome the clichée and be a more innovative and complex romantic interest figure Kasey Rogers giving a stunning performance as Guys horrifyingly manipulative and hedonistic first wife and Patricia Hitchcock proving that she is far more talented than being simply the directors daughter would imply The superb cast headed by a simply wonderful Walker really bring the film to life adding so much more merit to the film than simply Hitchcocks breathtaking stylistics  All in all Strangers on a Train may still come across as slightly too dated for certain viewers but its still a shock how modern and appealing to contemporary audiences seems considering it was released half a century ago Once again Hitchcock proves his unparalleled mastery of tension and film technique and the films surprisingly original and enjoyable premise is alone worth a viewing Highly recommended to anyone wishing to undertake a brilliantly made but superbly entertaining film experience  910
1,This movie as my Chinese girlfriend informed me features two wellknown Hong Kong pop stars While this may make the movie a mere marketing stunt I found the acting acceptable and theyre both cute The story is pretty poor overall The vampiric traits and weaknesses are however used in humorous ways and created some uniquely entertaining bits The quarreling between the two girls made me chuckle and this gave a fine balance together with the wellexecuted action scenes to create an entertaining movie
1,Set during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 this story has all the suspense of a good cold war book or movie as a multinational group of foreigners attempt to smuggle Jason Robards out of Hungary into Austria However three things complement the story making this an extremely good movie First the actors use the actual languages of their roles The Russian soldiers speak only Russian the Hungarians only Hungarian the Germans only German except to the minimal extent to tell the story Since Debra Kerr is English she speaks only English and of course Yul Brynner and a few others essential to the story also speak heavily accented English As a result the empathy of the audience to the travelers becomes paramount The viewer shares all the confusion and suspense of being involved in an illicit border crossing when heshe cannot understand any of the languages spoken around them Very powerful feelings are aroused in the audience and notwithstanding the heavy use of foreign languages the audience is never at a loss for following the film No subtitles are necessary Second I was in Hungary in 1995 and Im telling you this movie has it right on From the gypsy music overpowering the dinner meal to the underground caverns in the buildings where much of the action takes place to the village scenes the realism is incredible If I didnt eat in the actual restaurant in the movie I ate at its double I thought that I actually walked down the main street in that village Actually the film was shot in Austria Third and most important this movie reunites Deberah Kerr and Yul Brynner after The King and I and the magnetism between them as the story unfolds is nothing short of Oscar qualified Of course Yul already received an Oscar for playing that relationship so the Acadamy wasnt going to give him another one but that is the quality of the film Dont miss this one
1,This series has recently been unearthed and excerpts can be seen at least within Britain via httpwwwscreenonlineorguktvid527213indexhtml Presumably there is some hope that the series may eventually become available more widely The problem is that this series was followed by the series THE WARS OF THE ROSES that had a similarly stellar cast and which has been available to cable TV or at least crowding the market  The two series are quite different in dramaturgy THE WARS consolidates the plays through extensive rewriting and shifting of scenes AN AGE OF KINGS follows Shakespeare more closely Both series benefit from integral casting
1,Ive discovered this movie accidentally and it was really a nice surprise A Christmas Classicits also one of the fine comedies of the 40s The story line is simple  Elisabeth Lane Barbara Stanwyck makes out her living by writing culinary columns for a magazine At Christmas time her boss Alexander Yardley Sydney Greenstreet asks her to invite a young weakened sailor in the Connecticut farm she write about The only problem is  She hasnt got any farm and she cant cook To get out of the jam Elisabeth agrees to marry a wealthy friend Reginald Gardinerwho has a farm and flies for Connecticut with her wonderful cook Uncle Felix  Theres a fine direction by Peter Godfrey and the cast is really wonderful  Stanwyck has never been better as this witty and yet romantic woman Greenstreet Gardiner and Sakall make hilarious and human supporting characters The only weak point is the leading man Dennis Morgan He starts well but as the movie goes on becomes really a bore One almost feels sorry for Elisabeht Lane to ends up with him rather than with Gary Cooper or David Niven who both would have been more suitable for the part Anyway this is a joyful Christmas time movie with a refreshing score and I advice it to everyone who likes to spend funny and sweet Holidaysin Connecticut
1,Rififi deservedly gets a lot of mention for the famous heist scene and indeed that scene deserves all the credit it gets Its a masterful piece of suspense character interaction and photography But Rififi isnt just this one scene  every scene in the film is as masterfully put together and as a whole the film is not only taught with suspense plot and character but an adroitly told moral tale that set the scene for film noire for years to come Cinematically and technically the heist sequence may be the most impressive scene of the film but for me its the final scene that holds the most power  Tony le Stéphanoiss hallucinogenic drive towards redemption
1,A delightful and wonderful film which has entered my pantheon of great romantic comedies IN many ways its even better than When Harry met Sally IT wears well on viewing and reviewing The cast is excellent and both David Duchovny and Minnie Driver give us really believable characters
1,a mesmerizing film that certainly keeps your attention Ben Daniels is fascinating and courageous to watch
1,Definitely a movie for people who ask only to be entertained and who do not overthink their movies  Lots of action lots of great dialogue eg fun to quote a little intrigue and stuff blowing up all over the place Samuel L Jackson and Geena Davis had great chemistry Violent but not gory The fact that the female part was the competent action lead is a pleasant turnabout Have seen the movie more than a dozen times and still enjoy it enough to put it back in my favorite films rotation every 3 or 4 months I initially rented the movie because Samuel L Jackson was in the film but was caught up in the events surrounding Samanthas quest to regain her memory and have never looked back All you cerebral folks out there  suspend disbelief for once take yourself a little less seriously  you might actually enjoy yourselves
1,This show is my absolute favorite This show is intelligent entertaining and always full of surprises Lauren Graham is perfect as Lorelai Gilmore a single mother who is Rorys best friend Alexis Bledel shines as the beautiful and intelligent Rory Gilmore and Keiko Agena is one of a kind as Rorys best friend Lane Kim I love the witty dialog its what makes it unique about the show Kelly Bishop is wicked great as Emily Gilmore and Edward Herrman is terrific as Richard Gilmore Scott Patterson is a joy as Luke Danes and the band members are one of a kind to watch The Community Miss Patty Babette Mrs Kim Taylor Doose Kirk and others are always laugh out loud funny quirky and interesting that always makes the snappy oneliners stand out This show has changed so much over the years that it wont ever get old Gilmore Girls is an original and clever show that keeps you watching That is how good it is I give this show a 1010 rating
1,I saw this movie about 12 years ago and I can still remember it as if I just saw it recently That is how much this movie has affected me Considering this is a movie from the 50s I think it was ahead of its time It surprised me as in how it maintains its integrity in this subject some might have considered taboo back then Very realistic in showing the tumultuous and heartwretching journey that an addict chooses to embark on One can only imagine how the audiences were affected by the realism of this movie back in those days I personally think is was one of Frank Sinatras top five performances in the big screen When others are discussing movies dealing with Mental Illness andor addiction I always recommend The Man with the Golden Arm as one of the top five to watch
1,WARNING SPOILERS Five young people ignore the warnings of forest ranger George Kennedy and hike up to the misty Oregon mountains where they are stalked and butchered by a pair of huge deformed inbred hillbilly twins When only two are left Warren and his girl Connie they resort back to their animal instincts to stay alive The film ends with Connie shoving half of her arm down one of the killers throats choking him to death A very powerful if somewhat overrated backwoods slasher flick thats effective use of lighting sound and photography make it a cut above the usual FRIDAY THE 13TH cashin Lead by an attractive likeable cast especially Deborah Benson where is she now and Gregg Henry this nifty companion piece to director Jeff Liebermans SQUIRM 1976 and BLUE SUNSHINE 1977 shouldnt be missed
1,In Russia the ordinary teenager Vera Natalya Negoda lives a leisured life with her drunkard father and her simpleton mother without working and waiting for the calling for a technical course of telephone operator Her brother Victor Aleksandr Negreba lives in Moscow with the family of his own and occasionally visits his dysfunctional family and Vera being always motive for arguing When Vera meets the student of university Sergei Andrei Sokolov they fall in love for each other and decide to get married Sergei moves to Veras house but lives in conflict with her father This relationship leads the family to a tragedy I have just seen Malenkaya Vera and I liked a lot this deep family drama I am not familiarized with the life style in the former URSS but there are some unusual behaviors that I found very interesting The first one when Victor tells Vera that she was conceived not because her parents wanted to have her but because they wanted to move to a larger apartment Another one when the family goes to the beach in a truck Many difficulties of Veras family and their friends the repression in the park and other situations pictured in the movie are common in Third World countries This low budget movie is very welldirected and the story is very profound and real The cast has great performances and the actress Natalya Negoda is very beautiful In the cover of the Brazilian VHS released by Sagres distributor there is information that Natalya Negoda was the centerfold of Playboy magazine I am not sure how precise are the subtitles in Portuguese since many long sentences spoken in Russian are limited to short translation in few words My vote is seven Title Brazil A Pequena Vera The Little Vera
1,as a fan of robocop i always loved this movie i seen it when it first came out and finally i bought it on DVD from Brazil it was never released in the us on DVD i like the film but like everything else in this world everyone has their opinion love it or hate it no matter what a movie does someone will always say why didnt they do it another way in other words you cant please everyone if you love robocop you will love this film to me its so unique thats its not cheesy or silly like a lot of lower budget movies this film always kept me interested i can see a few scenes that robocop borrowed from here but tell me what movies dont do that a lot of films use other ideas from other movies and sometimes change them around fun film
1,Its a shame that by garnering a restricted rating perhaps the audience that would find this film the most useful wont likely see it Imaginary Heroes follows the life of a teenager after his brothers suicide Not of course the most original story in the world however it does spend a great deal of time humanizing their parents the imaginary heroes that failed in their sons eyes For teenagers who tend to put responsibility for their failures on their parents but yet refuse to accept any real responsibility on their own the movie sends a powerful message that in the end we all have our own troubles we need to deal with and that we all make our own paths But unlike other movies that tend to urge youth independence this one resolves the issues between parents and child and they become a stronger unit for it That the eldest child committed suicide is regrettable but not overlooked later in the film and the responsibility by all parties for the tragedy is thoroughly explained Although the subject matter has been covered before it hasnt been covered quite this way  the film pulls very little punches Now why this earned it an R rating is confusing  youre unlikely to get across to a teenager in this era without being realistic but yet providing realism restricts that very audience Were my junior highschool class have been shown this film two suicides may have been prevented In this case the censors seem to have exercised extremely poor judgment 810
1,Although at first glance this movie looks like the story of your parents high school life and many people will try to tell you that this movie is WAY outdated and I admit that that was MY first impression but honestlythe lessons that are learned by the heroesheroines are def NOT outdated Who doesnt want to be famous And who doesnt want do be accepted my their peers And the homosexual guyisnt there a whole controversy today about gay marriage blah blah This movie though released in the 80s still addresses some of the biggest issues in todays world This movie does have a little too much profanity and nudity for my taste though thus the 810 rating
1,I thought this film was quite good and quite entertaining for a film heavy on emotion I agree with what another user wrote about the script being sympathetic to the three main characters I think that this is what what made the film good It didnt villainies either Mr or Mrs Kramer and it was refreshing I think to see two people essentially work the issue out on their own and eventually do the best thing for Billy And although it was a little strange I actually liked the music in this film as well For some reason the music seemed appropriate for the journey that the three main characters embarked upon This movie flowed quite well and didnt doodle like some emotionally heavy films tend to do It dealt with a serious situation but didnt take itself too seriously It simply told the story in a straight forward way and it worked quite well
1,In dramatising Wildes novel John Osborne has condensed events eliminated a number of characters and generally implied rather than shown Dorians essential wickedness If you want a more explicit rendering see the 1945 film Wilde and Robert Louis Stevenson lived in about the same time frame but were certainly vastly different men and writers This story really treats of a theme similar to Stevensons Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde but note that Wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy whereas RLS took the scientific route Both the protagonists are men in whom good wars with evil with evil winning in the end The actors in this BBC movie take a different route too from those in the 1945 film John Gielgud says all the same caustic and cynical quips as George Sanders in his role really projecting Wilde himself but with a subtle difference Youll suspect that Sanders really believed what he was saying but Gielgud may be saying what is expected of him rather than what he sincerely believes Peter Firth too shows the two sides of his character in restrained fashion but then we dont get to see as many of his escapades as Hurd Hatfield had a chance to display Its a very good production with the dramatisation reflecting the essentials of the novel if not all of its ramifications
1,i was very impressed with this production on likely all levels from production to plot and character development this definitely fall under the realism genre since there is nothing going on here that makes use of creative imagination twists or manipulating audience in how a viewer shall feel think and asses the actors are great especially the little ones the chemistry between the brother and the sister is mind blowing maybe not even as common as should be in real life it is a movie excellent to literally watch while visualizing it one knows when a movie is good when one just does not want it to end but eventually everything does
1,OK why complain about this movie Its fiction Deal with it If you want to see the biography go watch it This is an original fictionalized version of what happened in Wisconsin People who are obsessed will complain about this as they do every other deviation of the facts Sad but true I think making Kane Hodder the man in which the film is named after was a great idea I thought it wasnt so good at first Ill be honest But that just made it even scarier If you like Kane Hodder Ed Gein or movies based on real events I think this is a good movie But if youre obsessed like some other people stay away from this movie and all others
1,If one overlooks the technical problems of this early 1930 sound movie such as the sound quality and the occasional stiffness of John Wayne one will find this movie to be an epic that is more realistic than almost any movie made since Beginning at the Missouri a large caravan of Conestoga wagons people and animals head west The wagons are pulled down huge cliffs and cross a flooded river with considerable risk to the riders in the wagons Indians meet with Wayne and allow the train to pass through their land Later Indians gather west of the train to combat them The wagons form a huge circle with horses and cattle in the circle and fire their rifles creating with the circling Indians a veil of smoke When the battle ends the dead are buried on the spot and the people and wagons depart This scene is remarkable as the camera stays with the dead as the living depart It is unique in the way it links the viewer with the dead and separates the viewer from the living The wagons encounter a major thunderstorm with torrential downpours and mud everywhere They finally arrive at their destination near a redwood or sequoia forest in Oregon The film is done in 70 mm widescreen at about a 201 ratio in 1930 I havent mentioned the plot because it is secondary to the scenic grandeur and the enormous amount of work involved in making this film Moviemakers will never work this hard again to make such a movie or any movie Given the technical limitations of the sound the music is at times moving such as when Wayne leaves his girl to hunt down his friends killers and at the end While all the critics rave about The Searchers and Waynes psychology racism short temper and complex characters The Big Trail gives us a story of simple people encountering extraordinary hardships One of the best westerns I have seen
1,I happened upon this by chance I was at my friends house and he had just started watching it so I sat down thinking we would shoot the breeze whilst this was playing in the background However within seconds I was immersed in this docudrama and we both spent the rest of the time completely focused on this and not saying a word to each other  I never knew the tale of the the first solo around the world yacht race let alone the tragic events of one mans attempt against the odds which set out to be his redemption for all of his misfortunes in life but ultimately ends up becoming an example of them Having not known of the story I did watch this with the same fervor as I imagine those who were reading about the race at the time it actually was happening engulfed in what was taking place and eager for more information hoping the lone amateur was going to pull it off against the odds and beat the pros which makes the shocking twists of the story all the more tragic I felt like I was living the story The story is told with great care and the interviewees have clearly had time to reflect on the tragedy which gives great insights but is also contrasted nicely by the archive footage of interviews at the time of the tragedy the recordings and photographs of the lone sailors is also excellently used and the insights into the minds of the sailors and how solitude was affecting them was superb Im shocked that this story isnt more widely known or has been turned into a movie but also thankful Thankful that we have this dramadocumentary to tell the tale from those who knew the man instead of some wishywashy movie adaptation and thankful that I caught this gem of a film by pure chance  Its a must see whether you like documentaries or not
1,My Architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahns search for himself via the legacy of his famous Architect father Louis Kahn dead since 1974 The film builds slowly but perfectly and what starts out as a seemingly lost fortysomethings identity crisis unfolds into a beautiful tale with much deeper meaning with regard to the importance of love loss family and perhaps more importantly our lifes work I had never heard of Louis Kahn prior to this film although I was vaguely familiar with some of his work Through the words both good and bad of Louis Kahns colleagues you get a very good sense of what Nathaniel must have felt as memories are recalled and stories retold Sometimes it seemed as though these people were telling Nathaniel how to feel about his father As I listened to each recollection my own opinion of this man would range from beautiful to horrible sometimes in the span of a moment so you get a good feel for the rollercoaster that Nathaniels emotions must have been riding The final sequence in Bangladesh totally made the film for me The reverence of which the people of Bangladesh spoke of Louis Kahns work tied all the loose ends together nicely for me and hopefully for Nathaniel I think Nathaniel Kahn finally found what he was looking for
1,I just watched this film at an advanced screening I had not read the book and knew nothing of the story but went because the book was voted Book of the Year by two local colleges So I cannot compare the book with the movie as others have done In short I thought this was an incredibly moving story The acting was believable and the insight into Afghan culture and political history was both interesting and shocking My oldest friend is IranianAmerican and so I felt an affinity for certain Middle Eastern values and traditions that were portrayed in the movie as they reminded me of the times I spent with his family The themes of friendship family human values and courage under fire are universal and are well developed in the film I wont list the plot details as these can be obtained elsewhere But based on the films technical aspects the acting and above all its heartwrenching story I would definitely recommend this movie
1,SPOILERS SPOILERS Its easy to see why the script for this film won an Oscar At least during the first half My head was spinning from all of the snappy lines whizzing by Noel Coward plays a New York publisher Why dont you publish books that you like  What And corrupt the public who charms and manipulates his many hangerson Then he dies in a plane crash and the story turns into a bizarre Flying Dutchman takeoff in which Coward must find someone who truly mourns him before his soul can rest in peace Very enjoyable until it gets bizarre Viewed at Cinefest in Syracuse in March 2003
1,The 80s were overrun by all those HALLOWEENFriday THE 13TH slasherstyle horror movies so this is something of a relief Ten unbelievably annoying teenagers would you want to hang out with these jerks decide to throw a Halloween party at a local former funeral parlor called Hull House During a past life séance a demon is accidentally released and each person becomes possessed and kills off the others This all sounds very EVIL DEADDEMONSish but Tenney lends some directorial style to the proceedings there are some good oneliners the music is excellent the Steve Johnson prosthetic makeup FX are scary and Linnea Quigley is quite fun as a boycrazy bimbo who pokes out eyeballs with her fingers and does an amazing new thing with a tube of lipstick Great fun on a nobrainer level After checking out the breakdown of the voting and the other posted reviews I dont understand how this only received 4 out of 10  I give it 8 out of 10
1,I really love actionadventure films and this is one of the best Of course we love the stars of this genre Bruce Willis Sly Stallone Clint Eastwood Kurt Russell Arnold Schwarzenegger and the rest but its the story that really counts The best are somewhat feasible but we can tolerate those that are a little over the top as in the comic book style of action The more twists and turns the more dire situations the heroes are involved in and the more shocking moments in the film the more we actionadventure fans enjoy them In the Line of Fire has ALL the elements required for a riproaring action thriller It has Clint Eastwood as a nearretirement Secret Service Agent whose one bad moment of failure haunts him It has one of the most evil despicable maniacal villains in John Malkovich the type in which you cant wait to see him get his due It has Rene Russo as the love interest It has twists and turns an occasional shock and even a touch of warmth and humor It is extremely well paced by director Wolfgang Petersen and even has a score by the great Ennio Morricone This one is a real roller coaster ride of a thriller Dont miss it
1,In Hoot Mullet Fingers is engaging in sabotage to stop the pancake house The problem is that the builders just start over again and he has to take more drastic measures When he is confronted with the dogs he scares them off with snakes not before he is bitten by a dog and has to go to hospital Roy at bedtime asks his father who works with the Department of Justice how he deals with crooks His father says it involves the tedious steps of looking through papers because sooner or later they all slip up You can see this with Enron and WorldCom Roy looks at documents relating to the pancake house and finds a suppressed document he does have to break in to the company trailer so when the police see it he has the law on his side Unlike when he evaded the police Mind you as mentioned before Roy is not always lawabiding and when the company man is killing owls illegally Mullet Fingers takes direct action He cant wait for the law Mullet Fingers is in hiding The movie does suggest that one should work in the system
1,While some of the things in Haggard are dumb and unnecessary the overall package is good  Haggard follows Ryan Dunn and his friends Valo Bam Margera and Falcone Brandon Dicamillo trying to win back Glauren Jenn Rivell Ryans ex  The story is followed and developed surprisingly well it doesnt wonder off and become an episode of Jackass or Viva La Bam although it does have a side story which doesnt hurt the main story And for all the Bam fan boys And girls there are multiple sequences of Bam skateboarding perhaps the weakest aspect of the film Phil makes 2 surprisingly small appearances even Don Vito got a bigger but pointless roll If you are hoping to see a comedy and escape Bams craziness then stay away from this movie otherwise enjoy the time you spend with it if you can find it There are some truly funny scenes in this film
1,The Coen Brothers have truly outdone themselves in this wonderful saga of three escaped convicts Though it is based on The Odyssey the ancient work of Homer you do not have to have read The Odyssey to be able to follow the story The brothers Coen have woven a tapestry of celluloid and aural delights The soundtrack is intrinsic to the film indeed it is as though the soundtrack is the product and the film is wrapping paper Each character is wonderfully exploited and harkens back to the days of old when films were rich with character actors whose very appearance in the film adds richness texture and authenticity George Clooney is magnificent as the grease haired Everett Ulysses McGill a honest con on the run whose pompous linguistics and vocabulary are comical and endearing O Brother Where Art Thou is easily the best Coen film to date as well as Clooneys best effort Clooney is good enough to warrant a best actor nomination as is Tim Blake Nelsons portrayal of the dimwitted friend Delmar while the film itself is deserving of a Best film nod
1,Lang does Hawks as well as Hawks does in the first part of this extraordinary Western before settling down into typical deterministic dark and guilthaunted Lang for the finale This is one of those films that shows its greatness almost instantly but at the same time very subtly Vance Shaw Randolph Scott is on horseback and being pursued we know not why  he stumbles on wounded Edward Creighton Dean Jagger and decides to take his gun and horse but discovering that Creighton is in a bad way decides to fix him up first This is conveyed mostly through facial expressions and very brief clipped dialog  in 2 minutes we know that Shaw is an outlaw but basically a good guy Shaw ends up helping Creighton on his way to civilization then disappears Cut to a few weeks or months later with Creighton on the mend and in charge of an expedition to lay telegraph wire going west from Omaha He hires Shaw as a scout who tries to leave when he finds out that Creighton is in charge but Creighton wants him anyway repaying a debt and sensing something quality Also hired is a tenderfoot son of a benefactor of the project but atypically the Easterner Richard Blake Robert Young is quite competent as he shows right away in an amusing but exciting broncobusting sequence Both of the hires vie for Creightons sister Sue Virginia Gilmore who  again not typically  seems quite as able to take care of herself as any man The camaraderie between the three men the comedic elements involving an unwilling cook and various rough and tumble types and the wonderfully played light romantic elements dominate the first third of the film and reminded me more of Howard Hawks Red River or Only Angels Have Wings than most Lang  but they are so well played and the action progresses so naturally that it doesnt matter and doesnt alter our pleasure  if it does perhaps change our expectations  as the more usual Langian themes of the haunted past dark secrets and the immense pull of the easier destructive and evil ways come to dominate the later part of the film Shaws old pals come back to haunt him as the the wagon train and its wires move westward attacks mount on the crew and Shaw has to wrestle with what if anything he is to tell Creighton about his tortured relationship with Jack Slade Barton MacLane leader of the outlaws Beautifully shot in early Technicolor and moving fairly seamlessly from sound stages to western locations this is for my money easily Langs best western and one of his very best films conveying as potently as any of his films the tragic inability of men to escape their pasts and build a new future Scott is as good as Ive seen him showing more with a flick of an eye than a lot of actors can do in a paragraph of dialog and the rest of the cast is uniformly fine The inevitable showdown between Shaws past criminal life and his potential future is extraordinary and a surprise even for a longtime Lang devotee such as myself and even in 1941 it seems there was no place more fraught with meaning on the margins of civilization than the barbershop and the dusty street outside You can get a shave you can feel like a new man but you cant really ever be one as long as the old ties are still holding you back Genius
1,I caught this film at an OutFest screening in Los Angeles in July 2006 Its rough around the edges sound recording in particular is wobbly and often very funny The script is rather jarringly episodic and ends abruptly but Ash Christian infuses the film with lots of genuine heart Its also a refreshing change of pace to have a gay film that doesnt star underwear models obsessed with partying and chasing straight guys Props to a warmly sympathetic Jonathan Caouette as Mr Cox a kindred spirit to Rodney Ash Christian the lively and spirited Ashley Finke as Rodneys best friend and Deborah Theaker as Rodneys mom who is given the best oneliners in the script and steals her every scene The film is like its writerdirectorstarlumpy and a bit odd but also very sweet
1,The movie is more of a mockumentary of corruption in the whole American system The correlations of those who vote who do not matter is so proved in the machines that end of voting a comedian to the oval office Politicians are such a joke that we almost need a comic to represent us as we have been laughed at for years around the world Bushisms have become a way of life for Americans and will be the only thing left after he leaves office none to soon Oddly the only person of honesty is someone not even elected to the position and tells the truth in the end The story is very subtle and if you go to it for laughs it aint happening Leaves a lot for thought Overall I enjoyed it
1,Cooley High is considered one of my best all time movies It certainly reminds me of days of my youth growing up in the cities of Cleveland and Chicago during the early mid and late 1960s What ever happened to Brenda and Pooter Some one needs to track those two down Brenda for her beauty and Pooter for his innocent wit They both deserve to be recognized even 31 years after this film was debuted I think a lot of the fans of this movie would like to find out what happened to them as well as others who acted in this fun filled movie I certainly think this movie should be entered into some type of MOVIE HALL OF FAME All of the cast of this movie was great My opinion is of  Cooley High  is turn back the hands of time those were the fun years
1,The only conceivable flaw of this film is its title Please stop comparing it to the first I did in my previous review only to separate it from the first If you havent seen the movie and are curious TOTALLY forget about the first and invent a different name for this There is nothing alike and has a mood all its own This is a great exponent of screwy mid80s comedy I seriously doubt such big names in this cast did the movie because they were broke or even wanted to remake the first Anybody who ever wanted to give a kick to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus I maintain the only reason this is in the IMDB bottom 100 is because of its title I usually hate movies like these ie adam sandler will farrell farrelly bros but this movie just keeps me laughing hysterically I dunno maybe its like a bad relationship I cant get out of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure Either way this is the single most underrated movie of the 80s behind The Stunt Man Robert Stack WE LOVE YOU 19192003
1,I really dont have any complaints about this movie except for the disturbing scenes with the body I fell upon it while switching around the tv one night The acting was actually amazing I didnt expect it to be better than it appeared I thought Keanuswho looks the SAME since 1986 which is a very good thing hehe acting was really great and Crispin played his character perfectly This movie is a hidden gem Its a fresh awaking of reality to the 80s compared to the other teen movies done by the brat packeven though I do like those moives alot too All in all I give it thumbs up
1,The 1970s opened the door to the largest most diverse era of film in the history Some films were great The Godfather The Conversation Mean Streets Chinatown The French Connection Five Easy Pieces Jaws McCabe And Mrs Miller Others were not so great The Getaway The Outfit Badge 373 Joe The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three Brewster McCloud Castle Keep And others were barely worth the price of admission Yet every one was a fresh breath of air compared to todays Corporate Hollywood Where every film is given a Big Weekend to recoup its cost Or go straight to HBO and rental What Decade does so well is to relate the sudden and rarely experienced sensation of freedom to be given money to make and direct a film Perhaps personal Perhaps not Sometime with a clutch of extras Sometimes in the middle of a busy street before the cops show up Long before the Corporate Overseers Suits Committees and Lawyers ever became part of The System The commentaries are superb Especially Julie Christie and Dennis Hopper Though as you listen youll slowly discover just how many Big Directors today Coppola Scorsese Ron Howard Dennis Hopper Peter Bogdonovitch got stated as Roger Corman Commandos Working long hours with short pay Shooting a film in under a month Learning all the steps and tricks of the trade by doing it themselves Turning in product that was ontime and underbudget See Decade for its message And for a long and varied list of films to watch made through those wondrously turbulent years Though I would not complain if IFC decided to devote another documentary solely to that most underrated Grand Pioneer of film Roger Corman
1,Just see it Its a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time See it more than once Everything that is seen or heard on the screen is intentionally crafted to evoke a feeling sensation or tone The clarity of certain visuals and the crispness of certain sounds are deliberately contrasted with blurred images or pops crackles hisses and barely audible sounds The structure is nonlinear and cyclical Motifs recur as time runs both clockwise and counterclockwise Expectations regarding plot and character are broken signaling a nontraditional use of film to tell a story that is both contemporary and as old as humanity This is a part of a review USA The Movie is emotionally intense intellectually intriguing and profoundly disturbing in surprising and unconventional ways Dion Dennis PhD
1,Like some people here I loveloved Stingers In Norway it got aired a lot later That also means that we are in the 176th episode yea thats right I have to say that I really love Stingers It can make me cry laugh smile and so on I think Im going to die the day we reach episode number 192 Stingers might be the on seriesexcept from Greys Anatomy that I really watch The actors are amazing Especially Jacinta Stapleton Personallly I think she is one of the best access we have I know he is not like SUPERknown but she is really a great actress Stingers makes me want to be a cop I LOVE IT PS Do you know if you can buy the episodes
1,I didnt know anything about this movie before I watched it It seems to be a lesserknown teen horror from the 80s What struck me were the ways it differed from so many other movies from that era The first thing I noticed was how slowly this movie builds It doesnt do the typical setup of showing characters being murdered one by one It takes its time building the back story leaving a little bit of mystery about what might happen I was almost starting to think no one would even really get hurt in this movie But everything leads to the climatic sequence during the last 15 minutes and then it gets fairly graphic this was a bad time to take a snack breakI almost couldnt finish my pizza once it started The characters also seem slightly more threedimensional than a lot of the cheap teen scare flicks There conversations were refreshingly levelheaded for the most part as opposed to the overthetop stereotypes youd expect For example the girl who is the popular snobby queenbee of the clique isnt constantly spouting insults at everyone but is capable of having doubts and showing some consideration for others So to summarize I felt this movie was somewhat original compared to what I expected and a little better made as well It drew me in kept me interested and then let me have it As I said its pretty gory during the finale but almost family friendly much of the rest of the time I dont need to own it but Im glad I discovered it
1,Tom Hanks returns as Dan Browns symbologist Robert Langdon in his first adventure Angels  Demons which Hollywood decided to make after The Da Vinci Code given the latters more controversial subject striking a raw nerve on the faith itself The Catholic Church was up in arms over the first film but seemingly nonchalant about this one And its not hard to see why considering Ron Howard had opted to do a flatout action piece that serves as a great tourism video of Rome and Vatican City and would probably boost visitor numbers given the many beautiful onlocation scenes save for St Peters Square and Basilica which was a scaled model used So I guess with the bulk of the budget going toward the sets the ensemble cast had to be correspondingly scaled down Ayelet Zurer tried to step into the female void left by Audrey Tautou but given Tautous character then having a lot more stake in the film Zurers scientist Vittoria had a lot less to do other than just waiting in the wings to change some batteries on a canister filled with antimatter In the book shes the fodder of course for Langdon to converse his vast knowledge of the Vatican the Illuminati and the great feud between the two but here shes neither love interest nor his intellectual equal Ewan McGregor on the other hand chews up each scene hes in as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna who is temporarily taking care of the Papal office while the other prominent cardinals are in the Sistine Chapel to elect a new Pope And he plays Patrick with that glint in the eye with nuances enough to let you know theres more than meets the eye Theres no surprises here for readers of the novel but McGregors performance here is one of the highlights of the film as Hanks plays well Tom Hanks The book itself is rich with arguably accurate content as always and had a lot more plot points on science versus religion and a wealth of information that Dan Brown researched and linked together in an engaging fictional piece of work While reading the book some years ago I thought that should a film be made of it its easy to lapse and dwell more on the set action pieces Sadly thats what this Ron Howard film did with a pace that doesnt allow a temporary breather Unlike the first film where you had the characters sit down for some discussion time over a cup of tea this one moved things along so quickly its like reading the book all over again page after page being skipped just to get to the thick of the action Catholic reviewers have called Angels  Demons harmless because I guess it didnt dwell on its many controversies unlike The Da Vinci Code which struck a raw nerve at the centre of the faith And if anything this film served as a great tourism promotional video with a nice showcase of the many prominent touristy landmarks that would entice many around the world to go pay a visit Naturally certain areas like the catacombs beneath St Peters Basilica and the Vatican archives remain out of bounds but the walk along the Path of Illumination now thats almost free Nothing new for those who have read the book other than to see it come alive but for those who havent this film may just compel you to pick up Dan Browns novel just to read a bit more about the significance about the landmarks and characters such as Galileo Michelangelo and Bernini who are intricately linked to the plot but much left unsaid Satisfying popcorn entertainment leaving you with nothing spectacular
1,It is an interesting exercise to witness the early works of great artists Sometimes even without the 2020 vision that hindsight offers you can see the cogs and wheels that make these people what they are Following is one such look into the past of Christopher Nolan one of the great timewarping storyteller of today Christopher Nolans style of filmmaking puts a great deal of emphasis on the delivery of the story Although people might complain it relies too much on the backandforth shifting of time I still find it fascinating to see how he uses that one technique differently each time Memento was probably the most convoluted piece of storytelling I have ever seen Discount the hardened cynics who say it is an old piece of meat wrapped in fancy dressing Memento shows how even the simplest of stories can be turned into a mindbender The Prestige which was considerably stripped down in comparison still showed creativity in how its three stories were interwoven Even in a jaded enterprise like the Batman series did Christopher Nolan sprinkle some of his outstanding yarnweaving tricks breathing new life into the dark knight Following is an intense tale of intrigue and mystery where we see a dilettante writer who becomes a reluctant voyeur who becomes an unknowing accomplice to a variety of petty crimes and finally sees an end no one could have expected Having never heard of Following before I had no idea what I was to expect At every point the film kept me guessing as to where it was leading me Since the mystery angle was clear I was constantly trying to figure out what was going to happen next And that is where I think the film succeeds so well The film has many elements that led me off on many wild goose chases The film is entirely in black and white and told in multiple timelines both of which are considered gimmicky these days Following does all of this in the least formulaic or contrived way possible There doesnt seem to be a reason why the story is told in the way it is but you dont feel like you are being taken for a ride The lack of pretension or selfaware arrogance is what makes this style of storytelling work Highly recommended
1,SPOILERS AHEAD Mel has got it going on From the opening credits to the ending credits this movie has straight laughs Dave Chappel shows why he is a comedic force Cary Eewes carries the movie most of the time but the supporting cast fills in strong when the plot is drawn away from Robin Hood Right from the beginning this movie proclaims its self not to be taken seriously If you took a time machine and gave the characters thoughts of modern day antics you would get this movie What makes this movie special you say Throughout the movie you see blinken and acuhu walk beside each other becoming great friends as Robin Hoods sidekicks But it Blinken is never told or fails to grasp that he is black until the crowd says  a black sheriff Blinken replays Hes black That is a timeless scene Simple one of the most enteraining movies of our time
1,This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies Death Wish 5 is the best one Death Wish 3 reminds me of West Side Story with a new twist Not even the recent flick Gangs of New York can measure up with one New York neighborhood in Death Wish 3 which is plagued not by two rival gangsbut one big gang A gang that is willing to do things like cutting a person to death with an ax if he trespasses on its set Deborah Raffin who plays a public defender plays gently in this actionpacked movie that is filled with a lot of shootemup violence So like Geri Nichols in Death Wish II Death Wish III scores with its gentle romantic moments as well as its violent moments Only the James Bond loveinterest scenes would do much better And in addition to his 38 Kersee plays with this new gun called the Wildey 475 Magnum It reminded me of the Dirty Harry movies when Callahan used his 44 Magnum in Magnum Force Sudden Impact and Dirty Harry The Wildey gun packs a big punch and when Kersey kills with it he doesnt care if the gun has a big kick in it And that antitank missile that killed off the main gang leader Well that is something Kersey would not use an antitank missile as his regular vigilante weaponthat is way too military for him
1,Its not real flashy but this movie does a great job of developing a large cast of characters and letting you know their hopes and desires while still managing to be both funny and bittersweet A very sweet movie Fun also to see Vincent DOnofrio and MaryLouise Parker so early in their careers

1,I watched this series after Tipping the Velvet for which I gave 1010 grade I had read user comments on this and I expected an equally good series or if possible even better At this point I must emphasize that this series is good and it definitely captured me throughout it and thus worth watching However I didnt enjoy it as much as Tipping the Velvet for the following reasons  1 Less passion love and related sexual content There were surprisingly little emphasis in these elements which I held integral for a love story Fingersmith felt like a watered down version of Tipping the Velvet 2 Similarly as in Tipping the Velvet the story had three parts the beginning a shocking second part and the ending The second part should have been the climax of the story as in Tipping the Velvet but instead it was almost totally skipped perhaps due to inability to make shocking but believable asylum content The series should have been in three parts featuring two cliffhangers with a lot more focus on the second part 3 Almost no weight was given to what Fingersmiths were and how it affected their personalities I found it rather annoying that the series did not properly address such central topic  4 The ending was much more hasty than in Tipping the Velvet Fingersmith left several interesting plot lines open Despite these shortcomings Fingersmith is a good series and well worth 710 However it is not a classic like Tipping the Velvet
1,Indeed Cynthia Watros is in this movie as Elizabeth talking to Desmond Though Im just wondering how she ended up as a rehab patient where Hurley is also in there trying to reduce his weight as seen from the previous episodes Anyway this last episode is really suspended The ending is not so understandable I think the writer did expect the audience that there is a season 3 coming I just hope the next season will give light to more unclearhanging events that were happened Just cant wait further for season 3
1,Most critics seem to have dismissed this film like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles as just another patchwork of mindless violence And while there is a fair amount of mayhem DEATH WISH 3 is not that awful of an effort particularly for fans of the series and its star This time out aging Charlies Paul Kersey is let loose by a police chief desperate to clean up a rough part of New York City The triggerhappy vigilante moves into the heart of gang territory where he once again becomes a oneman army in an urban war of good versus evil Bronson at least the older version is truly at his best Im not saying DEATH WISH 3 is a classic Indeed to the discriminating eye it has a plethora of imperfections The characters are generally made of cardboard The violence is over the top A man well into his 60s outruns and outspooks dozens of young punks But in the tradition of the original DEATH WISH and later films such as FALLING DOWN with Michael Douglas it has a definite crowdpleasing charm Who doesnt want to see gangbangers get their due There are also some great cheesy moments and oneliners so common in 1980s films When a tenant of his apartment building sees Kersey setting up a booby trap for instance the vigilante lightheartedly says hes thinning the herd A line only Bronson can truly make work So you see the key to enjoying DEATH WISH 3 is to accept it for what it is It aint Spielberg and it aint art So throw the popcorn in the microwave and have fun with it
1,This is a movie that will brighten up your day for sure Kermit the Frog is just an ordinary frog in his swamp when a talent agent stops by and tells him that Hollywood is looking for frogs to be in movie lol On the way Kermit meets Fozzie Bear Miss Piggy Gonzo and his chicken Camilla Rowlf The Electric Mayhem Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker But also trailing Kermit is the proprietor of a restaurant chain Doc Hoppers French Fried Frog Legs All things considered though Kermit and the Muppets make it to Hollywood This movie is recommended for everyone young and old It has some wonderful musical numbers like The Rainbow Connection Im Going to go Back There Someday and Movin Right Along The Muppets also use many forms of transportation in this movie Kermit rides a bike Fozzie drives a Studebaker and another car Gonzo takes flight with a bundle of helium balloons which is one of my favorite moments by the way   and Kermit and the rest of the Muppets finally go the rest of the way by the Electric Mayhems bus Dr Teeth Floyd Janice Scooter and Animal who meet up with them in the desert after Fozzies car breaks down Even some Sesame Street Muppets make cameo appearances ie Big Bird is walking along on the road on the way to NYC to break into public television The end is also a very heartwarming moment Every single Muppet created is in the final scene along with a final Rainbow Connection reprise But those poor Muppets worked so hard on their movie set then it all comes crashing down and the camera explodes in a huge ball of sparks Youd think everything is ruined and destroyed But the rainbow comes shining through the roof at the end and it all sums up the magic of this film and you know everything will be all right Perfect 1010 Watch it and youll be enchanted by the fun and sadness of this movie
1,Sure it seems like there is only about 17 minutes of actual content in each episode but it is certainly fun to watch You might find yourself cringing in your chair as buddy sticks his foot in his mouth and gets shot down or chuckling and shaking your head when some ridiculous line actually works The panel of hosts have more of a goodnatured friendly dare I say Canadian style of commentary compared with cutthroat US reality programming I think the people who complain about this show dont get the joke They are taking the show more seriously than the show takes itself Keys to the VIP is a great caricature of reality shows sports TV culture and the club scene I hope they do another season and Id be interested to see if a US version appears Its certainly a fun original premise
1,This film is Engaging and Complex while maintaining simple beauty Our two characters come together sharing the base of curiosity and loneliness but it is a springboard for learning these people they re life styles and pasts which support this The two lead actors Bohl Brundruge were in the moment as any two actors I have ever seen 100 believable they transport the audience seemingly effortlessly into their world The actors seamless acting teamed with Bechards Beautiful realistic dialog and his truthful direction drives the story forward into a striking and moving finaleThis film is visual treat soft increasing the intensity of The story The soundtrack serenades the viewer soothing yet drawing out the emotional content of the film I find this project to be nothing short of a masterpiece intriguingintense
1,I didnt see this movie until it appeared on television because I was doubtful about comic flicks Ever since the Batman series Spawn Judge Dredd and many other pitiful pg13 bombs I dodged everything at all cost I would question in my mind why cant someone make a movie that is rated R and stays true to the story how difficult is that And finally my prayers have been answered with Blade This movie pops right out of the pages onto the screen with sheer violence blood martial arts weapons fire the good against evil etc Yeah sure a lot of action flicks contain all these goodies and most of them have bombed But not Blade the movie was filmed just right not going overboard delivering a good length and never a dull moment Blade II is cool but not as cool as the first Blade is indeed one of the best real comic flicks Ive seen in a long time
1,Im not a huge fan of Lucio Fulcis films Most of his 80s gore films had their moments but often came across as secondrate Dario Argento imitations With the exception of the entertaining Zombi which was a George Romero imitation I didnt really enjoy them I know Italian horror often disregards the plot but the storyline and characters in his films were just far too thread bare even by the standards This is why Dont Torture a Duckling surprised me Its actually a very well made film with an engrossing murder mystery Its possibly the best giallo ever made only seriously rivaled by Dario Argentos entries into the genre And unlike Fulcis previous giallo A Lizard in a Womans Skin this never drags Fulcis direction here is quite good He keeps the story moving at a good pace and maintains the viewers interest throughout Also the conclusion to the mystery comes as a complete surprise to the audience Plus he adds some clever touches such as the upbeat soul music during a particularly disturbing graveyard beating sequence Overall the violence here is restrained and only used when necessary for the story The acting is good for the most part also full of familiar faces from 70s Italian exploitation cinema Both Thomas Milian and Barbara Bouchet are super cool throughout The only weak link is Florinda Bolkan whose performance is just far too overthetop Its the only laughable aspect of the film Dont Torture a Duckling definitely comes with my recommendation and may be a good introduction to the giallo subgenre as a whole 810
1,I watch the show every day and it is very entertaining It provides updates of tech news video games pretty much everything geek They are also the official broadcasters of E3 and Comiccon If you are a geek gamers or anything really you will enjoy this show They have definitely upped their game since the guy below mes review 2006 Its the only place that I get my tech info Kevin Pereira and Olivia Munn work beautifully with each other and the show always has segments referring to things in the game movie comic Universe If you know those universes you will understand the jokes Long story short aots is a hilarious show that gives me and anyone all the news about anything and everything that you care about Im watching it right now as I type this they are in San Diego covering the red bull air races Sweet
1,A truly accurate and unglamourous look into modern day life It could be set in any town in the UK  I live in a housing estate in Glasgow and can relate to this film very well Sadly the situations and characters are all too realistic but not predictable The actors are scarily believable I felt as if I was spying on my neighbours It was an intimate dip into the lives of fragile and hopeless people I was very moved by a few scenes I loved the way this film was shot Overall this film IS a must see
1,One of the best war films I have ever seen if not the best It is very hard to talk about such films as it is very difficult to point at any film mistake made The problem is as it looks too real and by that drags you in to the ruins of Stalingrad and make you suffer for both sides This is for the reason that this film unlike the most of Hollywood films doesnt glorify the war or the heroism of the main characters Instead of that the film makes them heroes only for being human and by that is antiwar as much as the reason can offer Extremely convincing war scenes and so impressive acting most of the scenes look like isolated theater pieces Also German army is played by Germans which is so convincing as well The film is produced and realized by Germans where you can see their love for details to perfection This is the reason why Stalingrad is one of the films I can watch million times and never feel dull I watched the film with my father who fought in WWII and the first thing he said was This is like real this is how the war against Germans looked like This is the place you can see how did it look to be a soldier in the worst nightmare of warfare in human history and turning point of WWII Stalingrad
1,When I first saw this movie back in the middle of January 2005 I didnt like it I thought it was too weird and thought that some parts that the main star Judith Light acted were so unlike her Which of course is true And then I watched bits of it the next day when it reaired and I felt pretty much the same Then I watched it again two Sundays ago March 20th 2005 and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing I even cried the first 2 times but mainly because the actress was actually crying and I am a big fan of hers It is a very well acted and done TV Movie Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a superb job in this film I keep watching it over and over Its a sad movie but very good If you have not seen this movie I definitely recommend it Its not usually my type of movie but I did enjoy this one A
1,Most movies from Hollywood seem to follow one of a few preformulated and very predictable plots This film does not and is a perfect example of what I watch IFC for Theres a guy Michael and his girlfriend left him with out a word He wants to know what happened Is she OK  Can he say goodbye  Perhaps get some closure He hasnt been able to contact Grace and in an effort to find her he has made a film asking for your help Michael figures we might need a reason to help him so he tells us his story by reliving his relationship with the help of a friend  Nadia  to play the role of Grace  the girlfriend who left  Hind sight is 2020 and it is no different for Michael By telling his story and getting feedback from his friends he realizes his mistakes and just how much he values what he has lost This is unfortunately a lesson we all have had to learn  or need to learn  and is easy to identify with That is what makes you want to hear more of Michaels story and wanting to know if he finds Grace
1,The Frozen Limits is a big screen vehicle for the artists known as The Crazy Gang They were a group of British entertainers who formed in the early 1930s In the main the groups six men were Bud Flanagan Chesney Allen Jimmy Nervo Teddy Knox Charlie Naughton and Jimmy Gold Hugely popular in the variety halls the group were also darlings of the then Royal Family The plot here sees them as the Wonder Boys troupe who set off to seek their fortunes in Alaska after reading about a gold rush in the newspaper Only problem is is that when they finally get to Red Gulch it turns out they are 40 years too late I often cringe when I see the statement its very British because it implies that those not of the British Isles may struggle to get it The reason it bothers me is because in this wwwinternet age I have garnered a ream of non British film loving friends who have been known to split their sides at the best of Ealing Will Hay and the imperious TerryThomas So then is it true that something such as The Frozen Limits is unlikely to be appreciated by a non British audience Well yes its true so much here is topically British but really it has to be said that the classic movie fan is pretty well versed in history and when all is said and done the visual mirth here is universal With the anarchic not so wild west make over an absolute winner A winner that has every chance of being more appreciated by an American audience now than it will be by a British audience Not all the comedy works and in truth the big 6 are trumped big time by a film stealing Moore Marriott But there are skits and parodies here that deserve respect and a nod of approval from more illustrious comedy acts You are unlikely to nearly fall off your chair like I did because of an Ovaltine gag but if you be a classic comedy film fan I feel sure that you will at the worst acknowledge theres some very talented people at work here Now then dose the Mounties always get their man 810
1,I quote below words from my favor writer Paulo Coelho as the comment for this movie  When you really want something all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it It is too easy to forget who we really are and what we desire to do in life Because there are always too many comments and advice surrounding us to tell safety I had almost forgot what the passion feel like Despite of the adventure will take me out of safety zone I truely believe the fear is just the price that I need to pay for the coming brand new journey in life Thanks for inspiring me with this lovely story It is the blessing for me to realize what unconditional love is That is the most treasurable love from the light of soul
1,This one man show may be the most fantastic show Ive ever seen To call this simply a stand up act is to do it a great injustice there is a definate reason that this was a Broadway show John Leguizamo is a master of making people of every culture feel at home listening to his story of growing up and dealing with his family and life in general I would reccomend this show to anyone as long as they can handle the language
1,One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkins short Chess Fever a mad tale of how a rigorously intellectual board game could disrupt even the most carefully planned central economies Such an unpromising comedic subject as chess found an earlier outlet in this delightful short Two young men play the game earnestly against an artificial background a painted set This is in contrast to earlier Lumiere shorts such as LArrosseur Arrosse or Repas du bebe wherein the human activity was deliberately framed by a natural setting The difference in activities naturalfeeding baby watering garden artificialchess is possibly significant The main contrast in this film is between this immoveable background and the placid serene game of chess and the fierce passions this latter causes as accusations of cheating lead to a most undignified melee The intellectual game becomes a gross physical scrap just as the pretensions of arty filmmakers are forever deflated by the cruder demands of audiences What is most amusing about the film is not neccessarily this descent into slapstick but the way it is filmed its prolonging long after the initial joke has been made the way the camera refuses to dignify the fight with anything like attention focusing instead on the set while we catch glimpses of hurling feet and dislodged clothing The films refusal to edit is audacious so that the humour seems to arise from something else other than the fight reflecting our need for physical contact over intellectual stimulation our unwillngness to let go What is especially brilliant is the denouement as these upperclass fops are caught by the valet who picks them up like two errant schoolboys as if he is about to box their ears If masters cant be expected to keep their place with decorum than somebodys going to have to do it for them
1,I have never missed an episode David Morse is a wonderful actor and I am hoping that this show can survive It certainly beats out that CSI crap I love the storyline and would actually like to see him as a cop again someday I give the show a 10
1,In The Line Of Fire tells the story of the game between an old presidential bodyguard and a formergovernment assassin turned psycho The secret service agentbodyguard Eastwood is on defense and the assassin Malkovichis on offense The stakes The presidents live I really like this movieIve seen it numerous times on TV and have recently bought it on DVD Yet its not an excellent movie The plot is way too thin and the attempts to thicken it are downright ridiculous The whole lovestory isnt very plausible and the way they brought an extra character into the story just to be able to kill it off is kind of insulting to the more or less intelligent viewer Though I feel these mistakes cant be forgiven I can easily look past them to Mr Malkovich exquisite performance Ive always deemed him to be a great actor but in this movie hes really on fire Theres a reason why he got an Academy Award nomination Rene Russo and Clint Eastwood were okay but I dont deem their performance to be memorable Theyre never at the best of their abilities If you dont expect too much youll certainly like this movie Its no masterpiece but John Malkovich is really extraordinary and I dont think anyone cant enjoy his performance Really worth the watch
1,This is one of the best TV movies I have ever seen The title makes it so obvious and predictable but come on all TV movies are like that The story is fantastic It may seem ridiculous but it is based on an incredibly true story Gary Cole plays a military man named Dave who feels trapped in his marriage He abandons his wife and kids and then fakes his death All so he could be with Alyson Karen Sillas How far will Dave go to keep his secret  The acting is top notch for TV movies Gary Cole especially keeps the movie together as a charming smoothtalking sociopath who has an answer to everything when his wife gets suspicious Karen Sillas does the best she can as a wife who discovers that her husband is a LIAR and doesnt know what to do about it Teddi Siddall who I believe is Gary Coles wife in real life plays her part well especially when she cries about the death of her husband Wendy Makkena adds a nice touch as Alysons sister Linda Goranson is great in her small role as Daves mother Predictable but the acting and the story take this movie up several notches
1,This is another of Eastwoods many movies mixing intrigue action and a dollop of romance along with The Gauntlet Firefox and so forth Clints acting range by now is pretty familiar In this one hes taciturn and a bit outrageous especially with women and superiors There are no surprises in his performance But the film itself is something of a surprise its above average  Clint is Frank a Secret Service agent who perhaps in a moment of doubt failed to catch the bullet that killed JFK He then took to drink which drove his family away and now plods along in the bureaucracy until he is contacted by John Malkovitch calling himself Booth who strikes up a sort of skewed relationship with him based on their shared disillusioned conviction that everything is meaningless except the impulse to escape dreariness and predictability Now this is rather an anfractuous set of attitudes for a performer like Clint to project but he does rather well less robotic than usual And he does seem to carry around with him like a burden of stone the memory of that moment in Dallas Hes tested again halfway through this movie He is hanging from the roof of a tall building grasping Booths hand and he pulls his pistol and points it at Booth who asks him if he is really willing to shoot If he does of course he saves the president from an attempted assassination by a CIAtrained murderer but he does so at the cost of his own life Booth twits him about the situation as they hold hands in midair And Clint even has a short speech talking to Renee Russo about his failure to save the president in Dallas If Id have reacted quickly enough I could have taken that shot    and that would have been alright with me Its underplayed but his voice chokes slightly his eyes water and his lip trembles Its one of the few scenes in any of Clints films that might properly be called moving We know from his newfound resolve that given another chance he would take the bullet this time The irony is that he doesnt like the current president Who could He gives pompous speeches in Colorado about how they carved a nation out of the wilderness Didnt they do the same thing in Las Vegas Its often said that a movie is only as good as its villain It isnt true nothing is that simple but an argument could be made for its truth value in this case The reptilian John Malkovitch with his Tartar eyes is marvelous Talk about disillusioned Okay he can ham it up a little sniffing with disdain even as he plugs two innocent hunters between the eyes but hes fascinating on the screen Renee Russo has little do to Fred Thompson as the chief White House aid is now back in politics a relief for moviegoers If Clints acting range is limited Thompsons is something less In every film hes been in he wears the same solemn and dissatisfied expression as if constantly plagued by some form of volcanic digestive disorder The direction by Wolfgang Peterson is as good as it was in Das Boot which is pretty good There is a great deal of the usual suspenseful crosscutting in the final shootout And when Clint and Russo fall into an impassioned embrace in her hotel room and scuttle backwards towards the bed like two weasels in heat Peterson playfully shows us their feet along with a succession of objects dropping to the floor  not only the usual garments but handcuffs guns beepers palm pilots Dick Tracy wrist watches and other impedimenta Interrupted Clint lies back on the bed and sighs Now I have to put all that stuff back on again Well written and worth watching
1,for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s its shocking how not a lot of people know about it this movie is definitely worth a look it has all the things you need for a horror movie especially the good old chills i remember watching this movie for the first time about 15 years ago but i couldnt remember the name of it so i came to IMDb a few years ago to ask for help on finding the title i eventually got the name of the title and bought the movie i still love it as much as i did all those years ago buy this movie
1,SPOILERS This film depicts the brutal bloodbath caused by the retirement of Johnny Carson to determine who would succeed him The impersonations of David Letterman and Jay Leno are performed in a satisfactory way by John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck though the performances werent great Reni Santoni is the bestperforming of the execs he plays John Agoglia of NBC and Warren Littlefield played by Bob Baliban is a close second I was shocked at the way in which Littlefield eagerly discussed dumping Johnny Carson This was Johnny Carson This scene evinces the cutthroat whathaveyoudoneformelately world of television Kathy Bates delivered the best performance of the film as Jays agent Helen Kushnick Another commenter asserted that Leno was portrayed as a simpleton in the film I respectfully disagree The relationship with Kushnick bordered on something akin to domestic violence She orders him around and when he rebels against her at the end she tries to play the sympathy card mentioning her dead husband and son however when Jay terminates their relationship she turns violent again screaming Dont you leave me you twofaced bastard before smashing a picture on the floor Overall the movie is hilarious and I wish that it were shown more often
1,Due to its predictable secondrate title the one it was distributed under in Italy at least I didnt expect much from this movie Thought itd be another cheap flick about a haunted house LA CASA MALEDETTA means The cursed house Well I had to change my mind just after the very first brilliant scene The constant presence of priests and the creepy atmospheres reminded me a bit of The Exorcist and some of its decent Italian ripoffs but this was going to be something completely different This is more like Hitchcock meets Italian thriller Very well written and directed good actors interesting plot OK Ive tried not to spoil the viewing of 7 Hyden Park for you which Id highly recommend to everyone  PS Am I wrong or when Joanna crawls or tries hard to stand shes paralyzed from the waist down her feet and legs move a little too much  And Im not talking of the bad dream sequence

1,One of the best movies I ever saw  a classic Matrix movie For many years I have been trying to get it on VHS or DVD  to no avail The German movieTV industry still prefers to let valuable cultural contributions and this is Fassbinder after all rot away and collect dust in some archive rather than distribute it commercially and make a lot of money with it if that is what stimulates them instead of the promotion of creative thinking Though the WDR once told me if I paid DM 20000 to check the copyright nonreimbursable and then DM 8 per minute of copying plus the cost for the materials then they will consider preparing a single copy for me Some way to sell something The same problem we have with many other TV movies or series like So weit die Füße tragen Sonntagseltern Kellerkinder and others Excellent TV series  never to be heard of again Germany wake up UPDATE from March 2007 Last year I finally could get a DVD copy from the Mittschnittservice of the WDR for about 50 Euro Great
1,Sister Helen is a superb documentary about a rigid intolerant foul mouthed bitter oblate civilian nun who runs a shelter for drunks and dopers in a very rundown neighborhood in the south Bronx All but one of the 21 residents are gutter drunksaddicts Robert the only middle class representative  he had a real job house and even a BMW  regrets she died before he could tell her off Why  Robert like six of the residents was on parole He complained that Helen wielded a huge stick over him and constantly threatened to turn him in if he didnt cowtow to her In an extras interview he said Helen ran the center to compensate for the deaths of the three men in her life  her husband and her two boys  The husband was an alcoholic who died of a heart attack at 55 One boy died of a heroin overdose and the other was stabbed to death at 15 Helen was left with one daughter who she abandoned to run the center The daughter was not pleased She wanted her mom Whats fascinating is how little Helen changed Outwardly it seems she made a huge sea change But after seeing this riveting and disturbing video a few times  once with the directors narrating  it became clear that Helen substituted 21 male addicts to boss around to replace her three dead males  Helen admits she ignored her kids and spent every day in bars But her bossiness intolerance and sharp tongue didnt emerge at age 56 Living with her must have been extremely difficult Even Robert says he stayed clean in spite of Helen  The film opens with Helen abusively demeaning a man who wants to live at the shelter Supposedly she is showing off her street savvy Another time she publicly demeans Mel her assistant for not bathing for a year Then she waves his filthy pillowcase in the air The film is viscous with Helen threatening and demeaning people Her signature song is My Way Her favorite phrase is Im going to be totally honest with you Often people who use such phrases turn out o be the opposite  The residents are really down and out Only Robert has any marketable skills beyond pushing a broom They all desperately need a roof over their heads and Helen since she runs the place on her own has the power to admit or evict whoever she pleases She has no governing board to answer to and gets no public funding It is her show  Helen believes in the cookie approach to sobriety She stopped drinking cold turkey and that means everyone else can too She blames substance abuse on the drug or booze and not the underlying issues that drove the men to drink and drug Shes no therapist just a landlady who dyes her hair wears a habit and wields complete power over her tenants and stopped drinking  Helen also lords it over her inmates by demanding urine ureen she calls it tests on requests Twice Major a very solid and respected long term older resident  who she trusted  failed his tests Helen was furious and evicted him Major stood his ground and said the results were wrong because he never did heroin Helen didnt yield and failed to consider a mistake could have been made This was especially troubling since she knew Major for a long time Yet she discounted her relationship with him assumed he was a liar and relied completely on the results Major eventually discovered the codeine in his cough syrup showed up as an opiate Helen never apologized publicly but supposedly made up with major privately Helen also had a very tainted reputation in her old neighborhood She tacitly admitted to Robert she once stayed up very late one night to slash someones tires The person wronged her and certainly deserved to have hisher tires slashed She was not a nice woman So eventually she decided the only way to keep the Travis name her last name alive  since the three male Travises died  was to start the Travis Center For some of the residents it was a great deal They complied with Helen and in exchange received a cheap safe sober and structured place to live One however said he preferred jail Addicts and drunks dont all need to be treated like children Helen employed old school techniques which have been discredited However no one was forced to remain at the center and for some it was definitely a positive experience The Travis Center is not a treatment center It is a residence for alcoholics and dopers who what to straighten out their lives  To receive the full Sister Helen experience see all the extra interviews plus the audio version in which the two directors share their experiences living with Sister Helen and her guests
1,In The Line of Fire gives us a great game of cat and mouse Clint Eastwood is plagued by John Malkovich in this riveting film Malkovich says hes going to kill the president and he purposely calls Eastwood and pushes his buttons He questions Eastwoods ability to protect someone Malkovich brings a cold but very intelligent mindset to his character Everything he does he does for a reason and hes not shy about killing Eastwood has to overcome the suspicions of his superiors in order to catch Malkovich but no one wants to listen to him The result is a film that crackles with suspense that escalates to a tense scene in a ballroom at the Bonneventure Hotel Wolfgang Peterson ratchets up the tension and we feel every turn

1,29 Sept 1990 marked a small but important milestone in my appreciation of horror flicks This was the date that BBC1 broadcast for the only time Im aware of Jeff Liebermans supercreepy 1981 shocker Just Before Dawn and it made a huge impression on me Nearly twenty years later Im delighted to report that Ive finally got my hands on the twodisc Shriek Show  Media Blasters special edition and its just as eerie and unsettling as I remember it if not more so The plot as is usual for genre flicks and this was Liebermans first film as a director for hire though he did at least remove all the religious cult snakehandling mumbojumbo from the screenplay is a bit thin  five likable twentysomethings including Chris Lemmon son of Jack in a pair of uncomfortably tight white strides venture into the dense Oregon woodlands to do a spot of camping and to check out a patch of land thats been bequeathed to one of their number But Just Before Dawn stands out from a crowd of imitators because Lieberman wastes no time in showing us just how deranged things are on this particular patch of mountain with a complete innocent skewered and a drunk preachers truck shoved down a hill and engulfed in flames within minutes of the film beginning The youngsters come rolling into the picture in a snappy Winnebago Blondies Heart of Glass pounding on the soundtrack and before you can say Texas Chainsaw Massacre theyve clobbered an innocent deer with the front bumper and had their first taste of aggro from the heavyset maniac responsible for the opening catastrophes Forest ranger Roy George Kennedy warns them that things are likely to go awry if they go any further but they go ahead with the trip anyway refusing to give the sozzled preacher a ride even though hes understandably scared witless and finally pitching camp miles from anywhere Needless to say things go downhill from here Although this films not short on bloody horror and wellhandled action scenes the standout moments for me are those where Lieberman lets his camera zoom out long and slow from apparently innocuous shots of the funloving kids larking around in the wilderness or just lets it settle for a while on the dense imposing peopledwarfing woodlands He makes the Oregon exteriors as threatening and as ominous as Kubrick made the Overlook Hotels spacious interiors in the Shining and Brad Fiedels score discounting the horribly distorted racket that runs over the titles stays the right side of intrusive underscoring the slowly escalating menace with subtlety and flair There are plenty of surprises along the way nods to Deliverance with the discovery of a backwoods babe and her freaky disturbing family and a truly bizarre kill technique deployed shortly before the films end I wont spoil it for you Ive said enough Quite why this undervalued horror gem fell through the cracks and became a cult item instead of a breakout hit is hard to ascertain but hopefully it will be rediscovered and appreciated for years to come  it deserves to be
1,Surprisingly good Mean Streetstype crime drama Foreshadows elements of Goodfellas and Casino Joe Pescis first big role Clever dialog I think the Maltin guide gives this a bomb rating I can only guess no one actually bothered to watch it Saw this at Tarantinos film fest and he said Scorsese used a number of these actors in Raging Bull
1,It kicks you in the stomach There are other films with more convincing characters a more realistic story and maybe even more depth concerning political invocations But then again most of these are not directed by Peter Watkins Maybe the one true genius artist of British Film to emerge out of the 1960s Watkins has made quite a bunch of rarely seen films that perfectly capture the spirit of the outeraesthetic world  the world of political ongoings social problems and governmental solutions Thus his work is probably less filmic than say political which some may call a weakening of their inherent artistic quality Then again why shouldnt art allow itself to become engaged Watkins dares And succeeds You wont feel well with this one You wont feel happy Actually you wont really like the film it is uncompromising honest direct unashamed a smash in your face in short You cant help getting angry you cant resist to let the things you see touch you That is what makes Watkins films so rewarding
1,HenriGeorges Clouzots film is quiet an example of the french transition cinema A film between the realism of the postwar cinema and the fullofmagic and symbolism nouvelle vague With some spots of the American classic films but not imitating it the director tales us a story about love crime and the importance of points of view We can find great actors too Suzy Delair is impeccable Is interesting too how we can find aspects of this film nowadays Quai des Orfèvres inheritance is palpable in Woody Allen tradition Plunging a crime situation in a picturesque environment The naive ending is also typical in Steven Spielbergs goodending films And finally I would like to point out the deja voo sensation during the photography session between Jenny Lamour Suzy Delair and Dora Monier Simone Renant in which the first one confess that she thinks her husband is being unfaithful and exactly with the woman who is photographing her That scene is exactly the one between Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts in Closer Mike Nichols 2004
1,Things I like Steve Zahn as Gus nails the part copies Robert Duvalls mannerisms which makes him feel comfortable to Gus fans some of the other actors copy their predecessors style in this series as well Karl Urban looks grim and tough but can crack a joke and smile too which TLJones did in original series The gear the guns the clothing all accurate or very close to period accurate Ill never forgive Costner and Duvall for having a nylon lariat in their chuckwagon in Open Range The Comanches they are actually riding bareback rather than hiding a modern saddle under a Navajo blanket And they arent painted as politically correct peace loving pastoralists but as a proud warrior people There are some dumb scenes but it beats the heck out of yet another variation on doing something stupid to not win a million dollars reality game shows
1,Usually Alan Alda plays characters that are too soft and overly verbal  its probably how he really lives This time he fits the character Though he overacts when the verdict is being delivered The 1971 Attica Prison Riot and the State of New Yorks response is remembered by many of us as a terrifying event Only a few journalists have told the true story This film provides a quick look at the horrors and excesses associated with the Attica riotrevolt Attica had a major impact on this country Maybe the movie will stimulate someone to research the history I cant remember a feature movie made from the perspective of the prisoners  though there is a great PBS piece with the actual Attica survivorsparticipants The perspective of the guards held hostage is explored in Against the Wall with Kyle MacLachlan Samuel L Jackson Clarence Williams III and Frederic Forrest Back in the day we shouted Attica Attica It was nice to hear it in the movie Brought back memories The worst part of the movie are the natural wigs Morris Chestnut and the other African Americans must wear It would have been easy for these people to grow a Fro
1,Just reading why this show got canceled makes me rather steamed This was a favorite of mine as a kid and I always watched it when it came on no matter how many times I saw the episode Sure the effects were not great but they were also not horrible either They did a fairly good job with the costume and it had the nice 70s vibe to it that is always enjoyable to see and hear as the music was also very 70s It did not really have any villains from the comics but then most comic book live show adaptations had none to very few actual super villains from the comics Spideys powers were a bit different here too he had his Spidey sense and he could climb walls but he was not nearly as strong as the Spiderman of the comics He was super strong though as I do remember an episode where he broke into a room by breaking the door knob off he just was not the car hurler that the one from the comic book can be The show was set in Los Angelos so there were not as man buildings to swing from but they did okay with the web It is nice that this show actually has the web shooters and not organic shooters of the movie I love the movies but part of me wishes they would start over and do the more smarty pants Spidey that has the mechanical web shooters This show had a good star as Peter Parker and he was okay as Spiderman it is nice to see a Spidey who does not basically live in the slums like he does in the movies Neither this show nor the movie though has a Spiderman that is quick with the insult like the one in the comic Still this show was fun without being as corny as the Batman show
1,John Huston finished his remarkable career with one of the most perfect and sensitive movies Ive ever seen For his farewell he decided to adapt James Joyces beautiful short story The Dead and made not only one of the most faithful literaturetofilm adaptations yet he also crafted a movie that more than 20 years later still surpasses a lot of contemporary cinema When I watched this movie a few years ago as a student at University I gazed in awe at the screen marvelling at every aspect of the movie acting screen writing direction costumes settings music cinematography Thinking about it now I still cant of anything Id criticise it for Huston just knew how to tell a good story A good deal of credit should also go to Tony Huston He knew better than to meddle with a text that is not only perfection itself but already visual enough for cinema Father and son let the story breathe and relish in the long fascinating conversations between characters and in the meaningful silences Donal McCann also deserves credit for the his performance as Gabriel Conroy I had never seen him in movies before nor have I seen him afterwards but he gave one of the most moving performances Ive ever seen All in all The Dead is a fine cinematic experience from a legendary director who never stopped being excellent
1,Universal studios The name conjures up so many memories to horror fans of beautiful matte paintingserlandscapes fogenshrouded countrysides full moons howling wolves taverns and torch wielding mobs Yet it is quite strange looking back on those films how little the era which produced the true classics lasted The 30s had its masterpieces but those were mostly from the same directors and many of their films are mostly of historical interest today The 40s produced more mindlessly fun matinée films than it did high art and most fans agree that the classic era of the Gothic horror films ended in 1945 with House of Dracula bumped around with the Abbott  Costello comedies and was officially dead by the 50s and the coming of the Atomic Age So its strange that perhaps one of Universals finest Gothics was made in the 50s That alone makes the film an oddity since costume dramas were on their way out EVERYWHERE It may not be comparable to the all time classics like the James Whale films and The Wolfman but damn does it condense all the fun elements of those films into one delicious treat Get ready for nothing but pure entertainment Since various social mores had changed the film also indulges in violence that would not have been allowed in earlier eras theres no blood but we see characters shot and stabbed directly and theres even a burning torch to the face The film may not really be a horror film but it sure has the atmosphere look and feel of one It begins in the dead of night with howling windsand wolves as two men seal the tombs of two apparently dead young lovers BUT WAIT One of them is not dead but he cant move Hes trapped but talking silently in his own mind unable to communicate What is his story Now THAT is how you start a horror film English businessman Sir Ronald BurtonRichard Greene giving one of his best performancessets out under the alias of Richard Beckett to investigate the disappearance of two friends of his who disappeared at the castle of oneeyed Austrian Count Von BrunoDid Sacha Baron Cohen see this It seems many years ago Von Bruno posed as a god to the natives in Africa to steal ivory he was exposed by Burtons men and the natives disfigured him Now he is lusting for revenge The film has all the clichés a Jonathan Harkerstyle ride to the castle an inn full of wary villagers death traps and a hulking manservantLon Chaney Jr The torture chamber scenes are genuinely suspenseful including a panel in the floor that activates a dungeon doorwhich makes for an ingenious getaway scene later on a hunting expedition involving an imported pantherand even an alligator pit And then theres the Romeo  Julietstyle fake death that leads to the films prologue The plot is cliché and the worldview is black and white But its still incredibly entertaining with director Nathan Juran making every scene pile on the atmosphere and seem fresh and new there are several plotholes too Why does Ronald attempt to leave the castle so early And he never does solve the mystery of what happened to his friends even though its obvious but he doesnt know that when he gives up and he seemed so sure earlier Weird All of the actors are great Despite being a rude upperclassman Richard Greene makes Burton one of the most likable protagonists Ive ever seen in a horror film Rita Corday is excellent as the Counts peasant wife who becomes Burtons love interest she may have the stereotypical falling in love with just a glance problem of all film heroines of this era but her portrayal of a longsuffering woman in a loveless marriage to a sadistic monster is very convincing she also shows a suspicion and wit few film heroines of this era do even seeing a forced attempt by Burton to quiet herAnd to paw at her necklace although it is simply to analyze it as it has an important clue as a rape attempt yet she never seems nasty in her paranoia the audience sympathizes with her Even though he fails to make Von Bruno seem truly foreign and otherworldlyhe is a villain in a horror film after all Stephen McNally gives a truly chilling performance as the sadistic nobleman When he reveals his burnt eye and laughs maniacally it is truly scary Lon Chaney Jr is also great as his mute henchman Gargon But the best performance is undeniably by Boris Karloff as the mysterious physician Dr Meissen He has little screen time at first but steals every scene he is in It is a performance that is both creepy sad mysterious and ultimately heroic As he leers evilly as he applies leeches to one of Brunos henchman spies on our hero and speaks in that famous You know Im up to no good voice only Karloff could make you wonder whether if he is a hero or villain always skulking about And although he does function as the main agent of our heros escape he still shows human frailties such as greed and fearfulness for his own life even coldbloodedly poisoning a man for Burtons benefit before he even gets Burton to agree His plan to help our hero  heroine escape also puts them directly in the clutches of Von Bruno as he arranges an amazingly sadisticIf unbelievably flaweddeath for them that had to have inspired similar scenes in Cormans Poe series He may not have much screen time but this is easily one of Boriss best performances While the ending may seem abrupt and anticlimatic for some half the fun is getting there and theres much excitement to be had Kick back and relive the days when Heroes were heroes and Villains were villains Its no masterpiece but its escapist fun at its best
1,Really This movie should be released to DVD I just got a bootleg copy of what I think was a studio film and I was utterly pleased It was on my list of films to own simply because of the cast Three of my PEOPLE Michael York Olivia Hussey Both having been in Romeo  Juliet and also John Gielghud sorry about the bad spelling were in there so on that alone I thought that for the small amount I was spending it would be fine Boy was I right Im not going to give any of this one away you may already know the story anyway but Ill just say if you can get yourself a copy in ANY formatDo it you wont be sorry JPC
1,Probably grossly underrated by all who never experienced the hell of living under communist regime Although it seems hard to believe all of it happened actually the reality was even worse than the movie It resembles Orwellian fiction only this is no fiction John Hurt is excellent as always Yes the screenplay is not full of action but life is not either Plot is breathtaking Yes people were shot yes thousands of them Their crime was that they wanted to leave communist paradise without government authorization At times the movie drives tears in your eyes We need more movies like this to really appreciate what America provides for us Excellent movie highly recommend God bless our country USA
1,Ostensibly Hans  isolation and despair are caused by a stereotypically frigid bourgeois mother a nagging wife and a lovers rejection And despite the complex portrayalHans himself doesnt precisely make these claimsthe above must be a substantial part of Fassbinders thinking as well his use of Freud and Marx But the viewer may look no further than Hans gender and sexism to locate the truer cause of his crushed spirit First its highly unlikely that his mothers lack of love pushed him into signing up with the Foreign Legion It was far more likely and is in part indicated that it was a quest for adventure male camaraderie escape from the female world of mother and sister and male identity itself which both the Legion and war offered Second Hans loses his successful job as a policeman because of his own sexism By falling for a prostitutes wiles at work he not only rubber stamps prostitution as an oppressive institution but shows that he cannot even control his sexuality in a professional arenaand is even willing to jeopardize a desirable career Third he commits serious verbal abuse against his wife in front of his sheeplike male buddies making no distinction at all between her absence orwhen she shows up looking for himpresence In fact he is more brutal in her presence A few hours later in a violent and drunken state he beats his wife in front of their daughter who intervenes on her mothers behalf The terror he instills in her and his daughter are palpable But both heand the audiencemove on with nary a whimper of conscience or protest Why Because his wife is cruelly characterized as both nagging and sexually promiscuous yes this this may be Fassbinders view of what capitalism does to womenowned insecure and a commoditybut this hardly absolves Hans brutality nor Fassbinders exploitation of her in the battery scene And then there is this male role pressure which Hans could choose to reject and protest but instead accepts Hes too short for a male and too unheroic to achieve the worldly success the male role recommends But how can these be causes of despair when he not only gains his lost love as a mistress but marries a tall woman who is considerably more attractive than himself Finally Hans allows Harry his war comrade to remain over his wifes convincing plea to the contrary on in their house By this decision he not only makes it clear that he is more tied to Harry than to his wife but that male bonding supersedes his love of women And supersedes in the end his own life because it is Harrys superior competence and spirit around the house that causes Hans star to fall Hans the merchant may be to a degree the victim of capitalism but more to the point he is the victim of his own allegiance to his own male identity His inability to let it go is the ultimate cause for his isolation and despair This is something that is lost I think not only on Fassbinder but also on Hans sister Annaalthough only to a degree lost For Annas and Fassbinders support of her brotherover her mother only goes so far She is quite insistent that only he can save himselfthat her support and love cannot it itself end his selfloathing Unfortunately she does not offer any of this same support and love for his wife who must be much more embittered than Hans but who in the end is able to pick up the pieces and save herself and daughter and present a marked contrast to Hans fall
1,Minor spoilers follow but nothing you wont have learned from reading the back of the DVD Held together by a wonderful central performance from Renée Zellweger Nurse Betty is a dark yet deceptively goodnatured comedy Suffering from an emotional and mental breakdown after witnessing her sleazy husbands murder alreadytroubled and desperately unhappy waitress Betty becomes convinced a character on her favourite daytime soap is her longlost fiancé and sets off from Kansas to Hollywood to find him Instead of making jokes at the expense of Bettys mental state writer John C Richards is very sympathetic with Zellweger portraying her as a lost innocent not entirely helpless but tragically vulnerable nonetheless Crucially shes never really a victim despite this and while she undoubtedly suffers horribly the motives of the characters who treat her poorly are all understandable  even Greg Kinnear as the object of her deluded affections may be an egotistical blinkered arrogant pig but he genuinely believes that shes merely a quirky wannabe actress with bags of talent rather than an insane stalker The farcical ending where all the main protagonists descend on the same place in this instance Bettys house at the same time to have it out is as old as cinema itself but it works quite well here even if the shift in tone is unfortunate Zellweger is ably supported by Kinnear and Morgan Freeman both doing solid work and its especially pleasing to see Chris Rock show restraint in his earlier scenes Not nearly as cruel as you might expect and not at all meanspirited Nurse Betty  while far from being a laugh riot  is a solid entertainment elevated to something considerably more by the lead actress
1,In this day and age in which just about every other news story involves discussions of waterboarding images of Abu Ghraib or tales of forced detentions at Guantanamo Bay Gavin Hoods Rendition is about as uptotheminute and timely a movie as is ever likely to come out of the entertainment mills of mainstream Hollywood Its not by any stretch of the imagination a perfect film but neither does it merit the caterwauling opprobrium it has received at the hands of critics from all across the ideological and political spectrum The term rendition refers to the ability of the CIA to arrest any individuals it suspects of terrorist dealings then to whisk them away in secret to a foreign country to interrogate and torture them for an indefinite period of time all without due process of law Anwar ElIbrahimi is an Egyptian man who has been living for twenty years in the United States He has an American wife a young son and a new baby on the way He seems a very unlikely candidate for a terrorist yet one day without warning or explanation Anwar is seized and taken to an undisclosed location where he is subjected to brutal torture until he admits his involvement with a terrorist organization that Anwar claims to know nothing about On the negative side Rendition falters occasionally in its storytelling abilities often biting off a little more than it can chew in terms of both plot and character The ostensible focal point is Douglas Freeman a rookie CIA agent who is brought in to observe Anwars interrogation at the hands of Egyptian officials The problem is that as conceived by writer Kelley Sane and enacted by Jake Gyllenhaal Freeman seems too much of a naïve boy scout to make for a very plausible agent and he isnt given the screen time he needs to develop fully as a character We know little about him at the beginning and even less it seems at the end He goes through the motions but we learn precious little about the man within Thus without a strong center of gravity to hold it all together the film occasionally feels as if it is coming apart at the seams with story elements flying off in all directions A similar problem occurs with Anwars distraught wife played by Reese Witherspoon a woman we never get to know much about apart from what we can see on the surface Gyllenhaal and Witherspoon have both proved themselves to be fine actors under other circumstances but here they are hemmed in by a restrictive screenplay that rarely lets them go beyond a single recurring note in their performances What makes Rendition an ultimately powerful film however is the extreme seriousness of the subject matter and the way in which two concurrently running plot lines elegantly dovetail into one another in the movies closing stretches It may make for a slightly more contrived story than perhaps we might have liked on this subject but hey this is Hollywood after all and the film has to pay SOME deference to mass audience expectations if it is to get itself green lighted let alone see the light of day as a completed project Two of the supporting performances are particularly compelling in the film Omar Metwally who makes palpable the terror of a man caught in a real life Kafkaesque nightmare from which he cannot awaken and Yigal Naor who makes a surprisingly complex character out of the chief interrogatortorturer Meryl Streep Alan Arkin and Peter Sarsgaard also make their marks in smaller roles Special mention should also be made of the warm and richly hued cinematography of Dion Beebe Does the movie oversimplify the issues Probably Does it stack the deck in favor of the torture victim and against the evil government forces Most definitely One wonders how the movie would have played if Anwar really WERE a terrorist Yet the movie has the guts to tread on controversial ground It isnt afraid to raise dicey questions or risk the disapproval of some for the political stances it takes It openly ponders the issue of just how DOES a nation hold fast to its hardwon principle of civil liberties for all in the face of terrorism and fear And just how much courage does it take for people of good will to finally stand up and say enough is enough even at the risk of being branded terroristappeasing and unpatriotic by those in power The movie also does not in any way deny the reality of extreme Islamic terrorism Thus to reject Rendition out of hand would be to allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good Rendition may not be perfect but it IS good and it has something of importance to say about the world in which we now live And that alone makes it very much worth seeing
1,If youve been looking for a film where a out of control nympho gets chained to a radiator by an extremely religious southern man then look no further than Paramount Vantages latest release Black Snake Moan Not exactly looking for what I just described you say Well then you best get ya wits bout yaself and mosey on down to your local theater and still see it as Samuel L Jacksons character Lazarus would say As long as youre open minded and dont take everything seriously theres no reason you wont leave the theater glad you saw it In the third offering from director Craig Brewer we are taken into the deep south where as the tagline to the film claims everything is hotter While there were introduced to the Godfearing bluesman Lazarus as previously said played by Jackson and the almost always half naked Rae a role bravely taken on by Christina Ricci In the film this unlikely pair cross paths long enough for their characters to each learn a lesson from one another Both lessons ultimately convey the message to us the audience that no matter what we are all human No one is perfect and if everyone would realize that then wed be a lot better off The question of if this will be understood or be accepted by all who see the film is another story One thing not up for debate is how great Jackson and Ricci both are here Youd think with the role of a sexcrazed woman overacting would be a given but no not here Ricci breaks through and demonstrates true talent with a raw performance that also doubles as her best to date Then we have Jackson who completely disappears and for the first time in a long time makes us forget who he even is Sadly the third star of the film Justin Timberlake who plays Raes militarybound boyfriend isnt all that great At the start he fails miserably as he appears to be trying too hard Later on he steps it up some still hes far from the level he reached in Januarys Alpha Dog The other thing Black Snake Moan boasts is a splendid soundtrack Containing tracks from The Black Keys John Doe pieces from the score done by Scott Bomar  of course four count em four tracks from Jackson himself Its actually one of his songs the main performance of the film Stackolee that is the fuel to the fire of this great collection It alone is worth the ticket price Other notable musical delights from the soundtrack are Bomars The Chain When the Lights Go Out from the Black Keys  the title track which is also among the most memorable scenes in the film where Lazarus sings to Rae on a stormy night The efforts of Craig Brewer cant go without mention though His last film Hustle  Flow which ended up surpassing low expectations and gaining critical acclaim put him on the map What he has done with Black Snake Moan will be what sets him apart from other newbies to the industry He not only directed Moan but also wrote its screenplay The end result is a story that is surprising and clever As you watch you feel like you know exactly where its headed despite its valiant composure Just as you think youve predicted the next move Brewer shifts gears and takes an entirely different route There are however some blotches within the screenplay The background characters are drab and flat while the ending is somewhat disappointing It left me craving for something more exciting After so many highs I guess the final scenes were a tad weak compared to the rest of the film I imagine the majority of people who see Black Snake Moan wont enjoy it due to the fact they wont be able to stop themselves from thinking how unlikely the situations are The depressing part about that is there are many other films with just as unlikely even more outrageous scenarios that are widely well received Its the issues of race religious motives  sexuality the film exhibits that will have more effect on opinion than anything The idea of a black man chaining a white woman up in his house is enough to make most people not even consider seeing it Simply put its not for everyone Like I said to fully enjoy it you have to go in with an open mind or else youre just wasting your money For those of you who can do that I highly recommend it
1,Chokher Bali was shown at the Washington DC Filmfest April 15 2005 The director Rituparno Ghosh was there to give a short introduction and answer questions afterwards As always I think Aishwarya did a fantastic job I can understand those who think she should be been more aggressive or more bitchy but would that really be realistic in 1904 Possible maybe realistic Im not so sure I think her interpretation was valid although there could certainly be other ways to do it I hate to use the word but this was the most inaccessible of the Indian movies I have seen so far I know a fair amount of Indian history Hindu religion etc but the level of detail here was far beyond me Clearly you would have a much better understanding of the movie if you were intimately familiar with Hinduism and its customs esp as they were c 1904 I missed a lot of thingsone of them being the fact that the motherinlaw would want Binodini in the house as sort of a counterweight to her daughterinlaw Ashalata spoilers Ghosh had several things to say that explained the movie much better for me First the original Bengali version was 20 minutes longer So what was left out Apparently three main things a beginning segment where Binodini Aishwarya leaves E Bengal for Calcutta According to the director different characters are speaking W Bengali vs E Bengalisetting up some of the political comments later Of course all of this is lost in the Hindi version and certainly to a nonIndian like me it wouldnt have mattered anywaybut a setup of the Bengali situation sure would have Next there was a segment where Binodini was writing a poema sign of her independence etc Finally some more business about the jewellery So although some people think it was too long I think the original longer version would have been clearer The womens hair was apparently another sign Ghosh againthe motherinlaw had short hair short hair for Hindu widows her sisteralso a widowhad longer hair more modern and of course BinodiniAishwarya had extremely long waistlength hair rejection of status of widowhood The ending really threw meall of a sudden Binodini who had never had a political thought is writing a political manifesto Whoa Ghosh explained that he was in Locarno at a film festival when the subtitles were done The subtitles use the word country throughout Binodinis letter Gosh said a more appropriate word would have been I forget his exact word something like self or independenceshe was talking about her own liberation and finding herselfnot about Bengal India and the British So why does Binodini just disappear the day after finding Behari again Apparently because during her stay on the Ganges she realizes that she doesnt need a manany manto definecomplete her She can just be herself So she rejects Behari who she threw herself at a few months  before and just goes off Of course Im not sure how she buys her next meal but thats another question The red shawl Ghosh againshe buys represents revolution as well as passion Im not 100 sure why she puts the shawl on the dying woman but perhaps she is rejecting passionrevolution The binoculars which Binodini uses throughout the movie to watch Mahendra and Ashalata the boat on the Ganges etc She is being a voyeur to see a life she yearns for but cant have At the end I missed this she leaves the binoculars on the table with the letter showing that she doesnt need them any moreshes going off to lead her own life Finally the Tagore quote at the beginning saying how he apologized for the ending Apparently Tagore wrote this as a serial hooking his readers with the sexy widow bits But at the end he sold out to conservatism and had Binodini kneel down at the feet of Mahendra and Behari begging their forgiveness One of his students  wrote to Tagore taking him to task for his sellout endingand Tagore replied with his apology for the ending In the movie of course Ghosh goes in the other direction
1,These are the kinds of movies I loved and still love growing up Unlike big budget movies that crate huge plot holes and never acknowledge them This movie takes in all in stride and just makes something you can sit back and enjoy There was some film student earlier that complained it wasnt A list material But that is not the point The point of this movie is that no everyone likes huge CGI Cliché filled movies There are a lot of people who like movies that are meant to just entertain you and not get as much money as they can Besides its also nice to know that good ol Bruce isnt dead yet
1,Bridget Fonda has disappointed me several times over the years but she had my attention in BREAK UP Its true the story is missing critical details in several places but I just kept scrutinizing Fonda for clues about what was meaningful in the story and she didnt let me down The look in her eyes in the last scene as she musters up courage to literally put one foot in front of the other toward her uncertain future is one of the most dramatic and significant examples of face acting ever I believed her completely possibly because Ive known and admired several tough broads who survived similar abusive situations And they did this without becoming manhaters but thats my own hopeful projection of Fondas character at the BREAK UP
1,Hammer House of Horror Witching Time is set in rural England on Woodstock farm where stressed musician David Winter Jon Finch lives with his actress wife Mary Prunella Gee  is currently composing the music for a horror film One night while looking for his dog Billy David finds a mysterious woman in his barn calling herself Lucinda Jessop Patricia Quinn she claims to be a witch who has transported herself from 300 years in the past to now Obviously rather sceptical David has a hard time believing her so he locks her in a room in his farmhouse  calls his doctor Charles Ian McCulloch to come examine her however once he arrives  they enter the room Lucinda has disappeared Charles puts it down to David drinking too much but over the next few day strange  disturbing things begin to happen to David  Mary Witching Time was episode 1 from the short lived British anthology horror series produced by Hammer studios for TV  originally aired here in the UK during September 1980 the first of two Hammer House of Horror episodes to be directed by Don Leaver episode 13 The Mark of Satan being the other I actually rather liked this As a series Hammer House of Horror dealt with various different themes  were all unconnected to each other except in name  unsurprisingly Watching Time is a sinister  effective little tale about a witch the script by Anthony Read benefits from its slight 50 odd minute duration  moves along at a nice pace The characters are pretty good as is the dialogue there are some nice scenes here  I liked the way it never quite reveals whether David  Mary are going crazy or not I think its a well structured entertaining  reasonably creepy horror themed TV show that I enjoyed more than I thought I would Being made for British TV meant the boys at Hammer had a lower budget than usual if that was even possible  as such there is no gorgeous period settings here as in their most well know Frankenstein  Dracula films although the contemporary English setting does give it a certain atmosphere that you can relate to a bit more Another TV based restriction is that the exploitation levels are lower than you might hope for theres some nudity  gore but not much although I didnt mind too much as the story here is pretty good Its well made for what it is  Hammers experience on their feature films probably helped make these look pretty good the acting is good as well with genre favourite Ian McCulloch making a bitpart appearance Witching Time is a good start to the Hammer House of Horror series as a 50 minute piece of British TV its pretty damned good now why dont they make shows like this over here anymore
1,Head is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968 The movie is a complete contradiction of the Monkees image It presents the Monkees in a way their fans never perceived them men with real thoughts Totally controlled by their producers the Monkees were given the opportunity to tell their side of the story The film pokes fun at their image the entertainment industry and corporate America The soundtrack contains some of their best music Its a movie well worth seeing over and over again
1,237 is an intense and fascinating drama which has some similarities in tone and subject with films like Bully Elephant and Kids although by my point of view 237 is a superior film to those three onesBefore watching this movie my expectations were neutral but I ended up taking a very good impression thanks to the intelligent screenplay Murali K Thalluris perfect direction and the excellent performances from a group of young actors The sporadic instances of school violence around the world have inspired many movies TV programmes and books which pretend to find and predict the external or internal reasons of those unbridled expressions of rebelliousness discontentand specially madnessSome people may say that 237 arrives too late to that artistic movement however I do not think like that because that delay permitted the movie to make a more artistic analysis focusing on the situation with more subtleness and intelligence instead of the obvious reaction of cruelty and anguish which impregnated other movies with similar stories On the characters from 237 we can find clichés from the juvenile cinema from director and screenwriter John Hughes RIPs movies to the teen horror films the beautiful princess the clumsy nerd the antipathetic athletes etcIt would have been very easy to make them become in hollow caricatures defined by their function in the screenplay but it is something admirable that the screenplay transcends the stereotypes to make them real people with credible problems which in more or less degree any person can find on hisher road to maturity 237 is an excellent movie whose only fail is that the ending feels a bit affected but which compensates that with a lot of positive elementsIt will be very interesting to see Thalluris next projects since he has had a great debut with this movie
1,When one thinks of Soviet cinema the propaganda masterpieces of Eisenstein or the somber meditations of Tarkovsky generally come to mind Theyre great films sure but generally not the most entertaining material out there However the countries within the Iron Curtain apparently enjoyed their escapist musicals just as much as the states had In fact from the 1930s up until the 70s forty of these songanddance extravaganzas were released to much adoration by the public However they are completely unheard of in the West so this documentary attempts to rectify that situation It does a terrific job of both showcasing these films and putting them into the proper cultural context Despite the fact Ive never been a fan of musicals I found this documentary to be completely compelling from beginning to end It goes to prove that no matter how many films you manage to see in your lifetime youre only skimming the surface of whats out there As for the film clips themselves theyre very entertaining While some of the musicals are blatant propaganda showing workers singing of how much they love working under the regime some of the films particularly the later ones look quite accomplished from a production standpoint Plus they are all extremely campy because of how alien they are to my western eyes Theres a few similarities between them and the American musicals Im used to but the presence of strict government enforcing of a message gives them a surreal edge They certainly dont resemble the musicals made in the West This documentary is both one of the most bizarre and entertaining films Ive seen in recent memory and its an absolute mustsee for any film buff 910
1,Great book great movie great soundtrack Frank Sinatra shows in this movie that when he wanted to put the effort in he could act The ending is a bit schmaltzy but for the time its understandable the studio wanted a happy ending The graphic nature of the heroin addiction groundbreaking for the period is a plus Add the terrific soundtrack and youve got one of the great American movies
1,This is a forgotten classic of a film and Harmony Karin borrowed a ton from it for Gummo Gummo is good Rivers Edge is way way better Its no secret that Keanu Reeves isnt the best actor whoever walked the earth No in fact hes a horrendous actor But he was born for some roles Ted Preston Esquire from Bill and Ted and his role in this film He is perfect as a sort of good natured but very apathetic and confused teenager Then theres Crispin Glover I think his performance in this film is the best of his career He is phenomenal as the drugged out wackjob character Then theres Dennis Hopper who is perfect as well This movie is simply amazing and if you havent seen it run out and watch it today Its brilliant One of the best portrayals of modern America Ive seen
1,This was on Showtime the other night and I figured it was going to be another madeforvideo crap fest like Earth vs the Spider or any of those other HBO horror shorts Instead I found a comedygore classic It was legitimately funny and surprisingly the acting was quite good Even my wife an overall horrorhater agreed and was laughing at parts In addition the FX were highquality Overall the film felt like a parody of Joy RideJeepers Creepers and the 2 main characters reminded me of the pair from Shaun of the Dead Definitely worth watching but dont take it seriously The End

1,The revelation here is Lana Turners dancing ability Though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub and ballroom dancer Miss Turner rarely got the opportunity to demonstrate this ability on film So viewers take notice Here MGM were clearly still trying to determine in what direction they would develop the still young starlet and were therefore consigning her to everything from Andy Hardy to Doctor Kildaire In Two Girls on Broadway however she is given an excellent opportunity to display her native rhythm and ability to shift tempo in the lavish production number My Wonderful One Lets Dance This number is conceived and filmed as a sort of hybrid between a Busby Berkely style extravaganza and the sort of routines Hermes Pan was designing for Astaire and Rogers at RKO Thus the number opens with George Murphy and Miss Turner depicted as bar patrons with full chorus before a curtain of black lame wherein Mr Murphy croons the number to Miss Turner Then the camera on a boom pulls backward in a remarkable crane shot to reveal an enormous stage and a rotating set equipped with steps columns enclosures and sliding walls From this point on Murphy and Turner execute a fast stepping variety of moods and attitudes including lifts spins soft shoe and ending with an electrifying series of conjoined pirouettes that concludes with Murphy both lifting and rotating Turner with thrilling speed to a racing orchestra All told a dizzying feat that proves Miss Turner was fully capable of more than holding her own as a dancer though I daresay most of her admirers would balk at relinquishing her from her throne as the queen of melodrama
1,Its quite an accomplishment that three stories filmed by three very different filmmakers could be simultaneously so insightful about gay  bisexual relationships and their struggles  Pool Days is about the awkwardness of adolescence and the mutual attraction between an older man and a younger one A story about experience and vulnerability A Friend Of Dorothy portrays a common dilemma many gay and bisexual people experience at some point in their life the intense attraction towards someone whom is heterosexual Sensitively examined this story truly left me feeling moved The Disco Years shows another version of a nowin situation getting involved with someone who is not only confused about their sexual orientation but is also terrified of being exposed as anything other than straight A very empowering story for those of us who have experienced betrayal at the hands of a sexually confused and frightened person  While these three stories will appeal to anyone who has an iota of empathy towards others they will psychologically empower those who consider themselves gay bisexual or searching Each story is uplifting in its own unique way
1,I really enjoyed this movie During the movie I felt that I wanted Pelagia and Captain Corelli to get together I heard myself screaming Come on kiss her The movie has a happy ending Good movie to watch in the evening when you want to chill
1,I first saw this film as a teenager Im now in my 40s and have long considered it to be my favorite movie The story is enormously moving without being sentimental The acting especially by March and Loy is deadon And the fact that Dana Andrews is too old for his role doesnt take away from the believability of his romance with Theresa Wright whom I believe is the only major character in the film still living This could have turned out to be another postwar melodrama but the script and cast are simply too good for that to happen
1,I have mixed emotions about this film especially as it compares to its forerunner An American Werewolf In London That film had its funny moments it was still more of horror tale than anything else This updated version now set in Paris does not have that edge at all and simply isnt in the same classbut it does have some good things going for it that the first film did not have and overall its still fun to watch  So werewolf purists aside most of whom think this film is pure garbage compared to the London version Ill still give it decent marks since I dont care what others think I liked it even though I agree London is better and I prefer that version too  The first 3040 minutes of this movie is strictly played for laughs including a hysterical scene with a balloon in a restaurant It also introduces the lead female character played by Julie Delpy I dont see enough of this actress She doesnt seem to make that many films or least ones I hear about over here in America This French actress has a face that is classic beauty so the film got points for having her in it and she looks great When the horror starts it can get scary and the special effects are good I also liked the lack of profanity in this film unlike the first one no fwords and no Lords name in vain  amazing However there are plenty of sexual remarks and there is one scene with a guy running out of bar tied to a cross which was blasphemous to me The soundtrack is heavy metal which isnt appealing to a middleaged guy like me either This film is geared a lot more toward 20somethings if that helps anyone Its entertainingjust dont expect it to live up to the first film
1,After reading previews for this movie I thought it would be a let down however after I got my region 1 dvd  the dvd was available before the film hit the uk cinemas I was pleasantly surprised strong performances from all cast members make this a very enjoyable movie The fact that the script is quite weak means that you dont get bogged down in story and therefore the repeat viewing factor is greater I recommend this movie to one and all 
1,KRAMER VS KRAMER won five Oscars including Best Picture of 1979 This intense and deeply moving family drama follows an advertising executive whose life is turned upside down when his wife of eight years walks out on him leaving him to care for his son and build a relationship with him he never had Robert Bentons incisive screenplay presents us flawed but real human beings with hearts souls and brains For instance in the scene where Joanna announces to Ted shes leaving him she doesnt just storm out the doorshe gives him the keys her credit cards the dry cleaning ticket tells him which bills have been paid and informs him she has withdrawn from their bank account the same amount of money she had when they were married no more This decision to leave was not a whimit was thought about and Joanna felt with no other option than to leave if she was leaving she was going to do it properlyand with no specific plan in mind she did not think it right to take Billy Dustin Hoffman won an Oscar for his Ted Kramer a man so obsessed with bringing home the bacon he had no clue that his life at home was crumbling into pieces Meryl Streep also won an Oscar playing Joanna the unhappy wife who we feel sympathy for in the beginning of the film but that all changes when she returns for her son Hoffman is at the top of his form here I always tear up during the scene where he tries to explain to Billy Justin Henry Oscar nominee why his mom left and he does it all in a stage whisper or when he meets Joanna upon her return and slams her drink into a wall a Hoffman moment not in the script that Streep was not told about in order to get a natural reaction Justin Henry hits all the right notes as Billy the confused little boy who doesnt know why his mom is gone and doesnt know how to communicate with his father Jane Alexander also got an Oscar nod as Ted and Joannas neighbor Margaret who has switched allegiances by the films conclusion This is an intense family drama but there are laughs to be had here tooBilly and the chocolate chip ice creamBilly pouting because Ted is late picking him for a partyBilly catching his dads one night stand JoBeth Williams on her way to the bathroom stark naked but its the moments of human drama you rememberTed running through Manhattan with Billy in his arms to get to the emergency room after BIlly falls off the jungle gymTed getting fired right before beginning his custody battle and instead of making a scene he tells the guy in a whisperShame on you And of course the finale where Joanna tells Ted shes not taking Billy which I found a little hard to swallow Why would she go to all that trouble of suing for custody and then just change her mind But this is a small quibble regarding a wonderful movie masterfully directed by Robert Benton and flawlessly performed by a topnotch cast A mustsee
1,Nothing really unpredictable in this movie but a solid flick in all respects Everything from acting to cinematography was solid Not a perfectly linear plot line but there wasnt anything you couldnt see coming Perhaps a tad melodramatic at points but again a fairly decent movie none the less Definitely worth checking out If in doubt of what film to rent over the weekend give this a go Though you may not feel like running out and buying it I found it to be quite worth while
1,This is another enjoyable and entertaining Hitchcock film James Stewart and Doris Day are incredible in this movie Bernard Herrmann appears as himself near the climax The scenery and locations are great except the one scene early on where the background was obviously fake which doesnt make sense to me since scenes before and after were in the same setting and they were real location shots Ive heard that Hitchcock did this on purpose sometimes The reviews for this movie seem to be mixed I think this is a better than average Hitchcock movie Very entertaining and it has a great light comical scene at the end I rated this movie 8 out of 10

1,Anything Park Chanwook creates is guaranteed to be unique brilliant and very twisted at a minimum Well anything that isnt Im a Cyborg at least Parks newest film titled Thirst is a vampire romanceeroticthrillerdark comedydrama  yes that is a lot of adjectives  inspired by the 19th century French novel by Emile Zola titled Therese Raquin Park creates a uniquely Korean and uniquely Park vision of the vampire mythos and asks the audience to explore the dilemma of a Catholic priest discovering himself having a thirst for blood and the moral and spiritual crisis that would develop Park delivers on the elements you would hope but definitely falls short of masterpiece quality like Oldboy or even that of Lady Vengeance Heavily bloated with a narrative that often loses itself much less the audience Thirst desperately needed another trip through the cutting room It crawls when it should be running but luckily brings it back home before losing the audience completely As negative as it may sound the positives definitely outweigh the negatives and another volume has without a doubt been added to the dark and twisted Zeitgeist of Park Chanwook film Check out the rest of our review at wwwthefilmstagecom
1,One of the best TV shows out there if not the best one Why Simple it has guts to show us real life in prison without any clichés and predictable twists This is not Prison Break or any other show actually comparing to Oz the show Sopranos look like story for childrens Profanity cursing shots of explicit violence and using drugs disgusting scenes of male sexual organs and rapes all this and more in Oz But this is not the best part of Oz the characters are the strongest point of this show theyre all excellent and not annoying despite the fact we are looking at brutal criminals The actors are excellent my favorite are the actors who are playing Ryan OReilly and Tobias Beecher because theyre so unique and changing their behavior completely And most of all the dont have no remorse for their actions Overall Oz is amazing show the best one out there Forget about CSI and shows about stupid doctors this is the deal OZ
1,Anne Natalie Portman tells us about how much she hates her mother Adele Susane Sarandon Thats how the movie begins Adele decided that her and her daughter were moving to California without asking anyone and leaving her husband without any reason The story is about the relationship between the mother and the daughter Its really deep and touching thanks to the great work of the actresses Natalie was nominated to a Golden Globe for that role She is one of the most talented actresses I ever saw and so is Sarandon They really look like mother daughter The soundtrack is also great The movie is incredible 10 out of 10
1,This film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is This is the true story of one woman and one man and their quest for happiness amid the dull rote life of a housewife and man of the house It could be any couple any family in any town but thats what makes the story so moving It touches each of us in some way and reminds us of someone we know and love or of ourselves I laughed I cried I couldnt stop thinking about it and what more could you ask for from a film really Especially a documentary This is an excellent film and one that I highly recommended to anyone who enjoys documentaries stories about families like yours stories about love life parenting loss expectations soul searching yearning wandering through life and finding your way or not
1,Was struck at how even the acting was throughout William Haines had an acting range that is wonderful for silent film Not over the edge There are moments where the camera work is most excellent and combined with the story like when he is waiting to see the Superintendent very well done  Thoroughly enjoyed the flick 
1,This movie could be likened to comfort food for the soul Anyone who has ever tried and tried to save a relationship could relate to this movie So many parts of it are so hilarious and so many parts are so heartbreakingly true Its not perfect in its production or even its dialog but the story is unique which is saying a lot for modern romantic comedies Luke Wilson is bland at best but Heather Graham does an exceptional job in my opinion Give it a try  despite the trite looking DVD coverThe character of Joline brings a lot of issues up in our culture of selfservice She asks us if commitment is really for the other person or ourselves Truly it is ourselves Following through on promises anywhere from marriage to an errand for a friend is a great feeling Anymore our word is nothing but a shapeshifting puff of smoke Joline is like a wakeup call We must be conscious of our words and commitments they mean more than we think At the same time we must not commit to someone who is incapable of doing the same
1,First the positives an excellent job at depicting urban landscapes to suit the mood of the film Some of the shots could be paintings by De Chirico Sophie Marceau beautiful The negatives the stories are hard to believe Unreal unidimensional characters preen and posture 100 of the time as if they were in some kind of catwalk This is neither the Antonioni of his earlier much better movies nor the Wenders weve all come to know and appreciate Malkovich is excess baggage in this movie
1,The film is about the battle of Stalingrad For those of you who dont know anything about it it was the worst battle in the Second World War Over 1 million people died in the course of the battle This is the only film that Ive seen that seems to have actually captured how bad things were in the war between Russia and Germany What I really liked about it is that the two ideologies Nazism and Communism were nowhere in the film Unlike most American films the Germans are not seen as blood thirsty murderers but what the average German foot soldier was a person The film revolves around four soldiers fighting in Stalingrad They were transferred there to try and take the city The film follows these men from August of 1942 to early 1943 During this time they learn about the horrors of war and try to find a way out of the battle Through the entire film one feels the desperation of the entire battle Unlike Enemy at the Gates the film makers didnt try to put some sappy love story or dress up factual occurrences of the battle This film may be fiction but it conveys what happened in the bloodiest battle in World War II
1,OK so this film may not have won any Oscars but it is not a bad film The original DOA is undoubtedly a better film but that does not mean this film is bad The film stars Dennis Quaid in one of his early roles when he was first becoming really famous after The Right Stuff made him a star and a very lovely looking Meg Ryan when she was still now quite famous This is more of an update of the 1950 film rather than a remake since the setting is different and the characters too are different The plot is pretty much the same A man this time an English professor at the University of Texas at Austin is poisoned and he has only 24 hours to find out who poisoned him and why Meg Ryan plays a young college student who tries to help him Jane Kaczmarek plays Quaids estranged wife in a low key but intense performance she steals every scene she is in Daniel Stern also in an early role before Home Alone made him famous plays Quaids colleague Charlotte Rampling is fine too in a supporting role The entire cast is top notch The film is stylish with a quick pace that keeps you guessing until the end  I think this is a film that is certainly worth watching as a thriller and as a modern version of a classic film
1, Heather Graham is not just a pretty faceshe is also an extremely talented actress She adds a unique flavour to the movie Overallits an intelligent and yet compassionate look at lovemarriage and relationshipsI thoroughly enjoyed it
1,Alex Benedict John Cassavetes is an orchestra conductor having an secret affair with his pianist When she threatens to expose him and create a scandal if he doesnt leave his wife he sees he has no choice but to murder her and make it look as if she had committed suicide Too bad for him our rumpled detective Lt Columbo Peter Falk is on the case Stephen Bochco has written another razorsharp episode for the series following marvelous detail with marvelous detail We watch the villain commit his murder and set up his alibi for about twentyfive minutes and were completely engrossed Then when Columbo appears on the scene it gets even better We first see Columbo after the murder as per usual This time hes at the vet with his new dog Scenes of purely comic relief are usually the weakest ones in the show think Columbos discomfort over the nude model in Suitable for Framing Columbo is hilarious when hes dithering or bumbling deliberately in order to trip up his quarry but too many writers make the mistake of showing him in a ridiculous light when hes with nonsuspects Bochco by contrast shows Columbo a bit awkward with his new pet in a handful of lowkey scenes that are funny and artfully integrated into the story And Im grateful he didnt strain for a punchline to Columbos quest to give the dog a name As far as we learn the dog remains nameless Bochco gives Columbo some of his best moments in this episode and Peter Falk makes the most of them Hes particularly good in a monologue where he expresses disbelief that anyone could kill herself much less this brilliant and beautiful young pianist And hes even better in his scenes playing catandmouse with Cassavetes That these two longtime friends and collaborators would play off each other brilliantly is to be expected and thats what we get Notice how Alex Benedict cant help but admire the deceptively dimwitted Columbo even as the brilliant detective is tightening the noose around his neck Bochco makes the most of every situation in his script When Columbo goes to question Benedicts snooty mechanic of course  of course  he asks the man to look at his own beatup heap And when Benedict finds Columbo at the Hollywood Bowl before rehearsal of course  of course  hes on the piano playing Chopsticks And what should our audacious lieutenant bring with him but the victims typewriter with the phony suicide note still in the roller Columbo also has good scenes with a precocious little girl Dawn Frame and the lovely Blythe Danner who plays Cassavetess wife Its nice to see Myrna Loy show up as Danners mother though she does little with her minor role The director Nicholas Colasanto who also acted most notably as Coach in Cheers does a perfectly creditable job though he follows the lead of nearly every other Columbo director by adding one or two silly flourishes Scenes end by going out of focus and begin by coming into focus Then theres that bit where Cassavetes sees the carnation he dropped at the scene of the crime  and we see a zoomin shot of it reflected in his sunglasses Theres also one scene with Myrna Loy and group of old fogies that is atrociously performed by everyone except Cassavetes These are quibbles though This is a splendidly entertaining episode the kind that made me a Columbo fan
1,This is one of the best of the early Star Trek episodes with Kirk and his crew venturing into the unknown to do battle with an enemy known only by name Imagine their surprise when they find out that the dreaded Romulans are racial offshoots of the Vulcans Young Mr Stiles wellplayed by Paul Comi is one of the few truly unlikable characters in the Star Trek universe His barely disguised hatred of Mr Spock is eerily similar to the post911 hatred and suspicion many Americans have of people of Arab or Middle Eastern origin The atmosphere of wartime paranoia is all too real Then theres the Romulans theyre the ultimate Federation nemesis The Klingons are nasty but basically harmless more of a nuisance than a serious threat The Romulans however mean business theyre the ancient Romans reborn in the space age in spite of their Vulcanoid features theyre clearly meant to remind us of imperial Rome with names like Decius and titles like centurion and praetor The chainmail armor is really cool Familiar guest star Mark Lenard who went on to play Spocks dad Sorek as well as the Klingon commander in Star Trek the Motion Picture is an appropriately grizzled warweary commander a character who bears a striking resemblance to Laurence Oliviers Crassus in Spartacus Also his questioning of the Empires unquenchable thirst for conquest reminds me of the similar misgivings Marcus Aurelius Richard Harris expressed at the beginning of Gladiator A must both for Trekkies and swordandsandal epic fans
1,Despite all its trappings of style and cinematic invention this is basically another serial killer thriller following the same sort of plotline favoured by such old favourites as Silence of the Lambs  team of cops follows the trail of particularly nasty murders someone else gets taken and they somehow have to find out where they are before its too late Only in this case the only person who knows the killer himself powerfully played by Vincent DOnofrio is in a coma and we need psychologist Jennifer Lopez scifi mindmeld machine to get into his head and force him to tell all This is where the film gets all new and different as we enter via a 21stCentury CGI update of Dr Whos kaleidoscopic favourite the trendy time tunnel a kind of Hellraisery weird world of scary crazy stuff going on all over the place ruled over by DOnofrio now a kind of superking overlord of his twisted mental world inside his comatose body The insidethemind sequences are well realised and often pretty stunning all the leads perform adequately the gruesomeness is to the max if you like that kind of thing but the hype around the whole thing led to a disappointment for me as I had expected something completely new and unlike anything ever done before not this fairly successful blending of serialkiller and specialeffecthorror genre staples Sometimes horrifying often pretty a fairly gripping story told with care and attention by talented film people but by no means the great leap into the unknown it has been marketed as
1,Clyde Bruckman borrows the premise of this short from Buster Keatons Seven Chances recently tepidly remade as The Bachelor In the original Buster has 24hours to get married in order to inherit a large sum of money In this version musical teacher Prof Shemp has only 7 hours After all it is a short This is one of the better Stooges shorts due to the storyline and wonderful routines Including the telephone booth scene with Moe  Shemp reminiscent of Laurel  Hardys Berth Marks and the Marx Brothers famous stateroom scene in Night At The Opera  here the boys hold their own in their variation of this routine Im not a huge Stooges fan but this one should be noted by any student of comedy as one of their very best since the early 30s shorts
1,As a veteran screen writing instructor at Richland College in Dallas and a former MGM screenwriter back in the days of decent films I am thrilled to have accidentally clicked on Channel 33 in Dallas tonight and watched this enchanting film in which Betty White is GORGEOUS and makes one yearn for the good old days of truly good movies before Hollywood started banging out all this crap for the teenagers If a producer is listening Id like to state that there are enough of us over 60s who will happily pay a buck to see a movie that has no guns no killing no special effects no sex and violence and just a good touching tale of human relationships that leaves you with a good warm feeling as this film did for me
1,The Western can be divided into many subgenres One of the broadest divisions is that between Town Westerns and Plains Westerns Most Westerns are a mix of both but at one end of the spectrum you have pictures like High Noon and Rio Bravo that take place almost entirely in a settlement seldom venturing out into the real outdoors At the other end you have ones like Wagon Master where there is barely a homestead on view amid the wilderness Director John Ford normally thrived on the bit of both Westerns shooting the interiors with an emphasis on their being small and confined and then contrasting this with the wide open exteriors which appeared both exciting and dangerous Wagon Master has a typical Frank Nugent script with some interplay between seasoned oldsters and green youngsters but still it presents Ford with some fresh challenges In this picture the dangers do not come from the harshness of the landscape they come from within the group in the form of the Cleggses Whats more the absence of real interior scenes means the outdoors could lose its impact over time However Ford was a real maestro when it came to manipulating space He shoots scenes of the camp or the wagons so the frame is surrounded and we get that same sense of enclosure as we would in a genuine interior Also compared to his other Westerns he does not in fact open out the space too much having the wagon trail wend its way through canyons and passes rather than cross the stark and empty plains One of the few moments where he does throw the landscape wide open is when the Indians are spotted and there is the possibility of a threat from outside Wagon Master features some surprisingly effective moments of comic relief and some great contributions from the quirky cast Harry Carey Jr was shaping up into a fine actor like his pa and this is one of his better early roles Joanne Dru was disappointing in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon but she appears more at ease as a character with a bit of sass and is actually fairly good here Jane Darwell who won an Oscar in the John Forddirected Grapes of Wrath a decade earlier appears here with sole function of performing a running gag in which she sounds a feeble old horn Still with her great timing and movement she makes the piece work Francis Ford in one of the many mute drunkard roles he played in his little brothers pictures is at his cheeky best And now we come to lead man Ben Johnson Although he was by no means a bad actor he was never going to become a big star like John Wayne And yet with his effortless horsemanship and easygoing drawl he was one of the most authentically West players around And this brings me onto my final point This was apparently one of Fords personal favourites despite it seeming fairly unassuming Wagon Master has no grand theme or dramatic intensity it is simply the genre playing itself out I think this is what Ford loved about it Its a picture for the Ben Johnsons and the Harry Carey Jrs not the John Waynes or the Henry Fondas Small in scope but worthy in its class
1,Has anyone found a way to purchase copies of this series yet I can see that a lot of people have inquired but I cant tell if any of them have been successful Its hard to believe that a series this good cannot be viewed by people today especially one based on real issues faced by real people during what were both tense and exciting times in our country How can this be true and what can we do to change it As an aside I agree with all the comments other writers have made about this series on this web site This is an excellent story about events that everyone should be aware of and know something about today Lots of us saw this series when we were in college or around that time anyway Now we want to share it with our children  but we cant If that is true what would some good written materials be that would relay the same information
1,An Intelligent and well obtained film worth to export  In this exiting and really intelligent movie filmed entirely in Bogotá you can feel the total meaning of the word Bluffalthough is a Colombian film the title is in presented in English   The story is about Nicolas Andrade Federico Lorusso a photographer who find his girlfriend Margarita Catalina Aristizabal having an affair with his boss Pablo Mallarino Victor Mallarino owner of a magazine after this Nicolas is left without girlfriend and without any job Nicolas revenge to Mallarino consists in following him and obtaining photographs of him with his new affair Alexandra Carolina Gomez to blackmail Mallarino in order to obtain money in change for not showing the photographs to Margarita The story is really intelligent and well related to the point that youll understand fully the meaning of the title the movie shows a thriller with a lot of a comic scenes and characters resulting in a real pleasure to someone that enjoy the movies focused on a good script I stand out here that this film is different from the typical Colombian movies that shows some dark and violent image of our beautiful country which is something really refreshing Some critics say that this story dont show Colombian typical way of living so it could be held in any part of the world i disagree with this 1 the movie is totally filmed in Bogotá so you can see streets and images of the real Colombian capital i hope that some American people and movie producers watch this so they stop showing Amazonic jungle or Mexican little towns in Bogota as on some Hollywood movies 2 the characters dialogs accent with exception from Nicolas that is from Argentina are totally from here Rosemary Veronica Orozco has an accent typical from Cali 3 you can also see social and cultural differences from the common people in Bogotá I hope that all this plus an English title move people from other countries to watch this masterpiece of Martinez Excellent acting of Veronica Orozco Luis Eduardo Arango detective Wilson Montes Felipe Botero outstanding as detective Ricardo Perez and good acting of Mallarino Catalina Aristizabal and Federico Lorusso A movie worth to export that people from around the globe will surely understand and enjoy Dont miss this movie 910
1,Rowan Atkinson delivers an unforgettable performance as the clueless Mr Bean who never goes far without his Teddy Bear The appeal of Mr Bean is largely his childish behavior and innocence We dont know if he came from the sky or another planet He is the kind of strange character that you cant make up quite easily He is often alone and used to it He has a hard time communicating through speech which might be why we only hear his grunts at times There are other characters who speak to him and he responds The character of Mr Bean is a mystery and still is He lives alone and does the unthinkable when he can do the sensible thing Mr Bean is rather an odd man out who does not mind it much He rather live a simple life with his yellow car and teddy bear and hopes to get to work on time
1,My God this is funny stuff Yes its puerile in the extreme but also rather witty Heres the page with all the wines on it Its a little early for us Im afraid Well what are you doing up then and the fight sequences are second to none Despite what you may have heard the laughs do keep coming and at a surprisingly generous rate The sheer comic abilities of Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson help keep it riotously funny wringing every drop of comedy from the script I can only compare it to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas  you either find that film hysterical throughout or not at all the same applies here Its probably the funniest British film since Withnail and I but to say its an acquired taste is something of a gross sic understatement
1,I saw this years ago and its entertaining but not profound The basic story is of a young man who dreams of Midian though hes not sure where it is or even if it really exists Spoilers Follow He finally visits it gets transformed to a Nightbreed creature by being bitten by another one Then he has to help the other members of the Nightbreed because theyre being attacked by Canadians Save for the accents they all act like Good Ol Boys Not much in tune with the Canadian psyche eh Someone observed for monsters or Nightbreed substitute Jews and for the Canadianshumans substitute Nazis and youre supposed to get an insight into the struggle by the monsters versus the humans Well maybe One major objection I had was that while the underground city was interesting it was rather ramshackle and frankly dirty This must be a convention for movies with underground settlements One would think that if the monsters were the good guys some would have at least a little sense of decor The storyline is a tad thin but thats to introduce characters But its entertaining enough for a repeat view
1,Despite its many faults Hallmarks 1995 version of Gullivers Travels is still the finest adaptation of Jonathan Swifts satirical classic  largely because it not only includes ALL of Gullivers many travels but also includes the satire thats often overlooked Unfortunately the twin problems of the books highly episodic structure and a television budget even a fairly lavish one remain The book is a somewhat rambling collection of travellers tales moving simply from one surreal landscape to another but Simon Moores adaptation tries to impose some order on the chaos by providing a parallel plot that sees Gulliver returned to England clearly deeply traumatised and trying to prove his way out of the insane asylum where the rival for his wifes affections has had him committed The England scenes at once mirror and comment on the travels elements of which occasionally spill over into the real world The trouble is that for the first hour or so it acts more as a distraction constantly pulling you away from the story just as it starts to get interesting The Lilliput scenes suffer worse here with the feeling that the home scenes are too often designed to save them from filming the more expensive setpieces  this has to be the only version where we dont see Gulliver pulling the Blefescu fleet behind him Yet once Gulliver makes his escape the tone becomes more consistent as he finds his situation reversed and himself the pet of the giants of the Utopians of Brobdingnag a guest of the wise men of the floating island of Laputa who are so engrossed in science that they have no common sense left the guestprisoner of a historian who leans history directly from the source offered immortality with all its terrible consequences before finally finding a world he wants to belong if only he can convince the sublime talking horses the Houynhnhms that hes not an uncivilized Yahoo each new destination convincing him of what an absurd and petty species humanity is For the most part its a darker set of Travels than expected with only Gullivers curiosity and commonsense and disappointment keeping it from plunging into irretrievable bleakness  and even this is offset by the scenes in the asylum where it becomes more obvious that even if he is telling the truth it may well have driven him genuinely insane Its in these latter scenes that Ted Dansons Gulliver really shines never more so than in an extraordinary speech where he turns his trial into a disappointed judgment on the whole human race Being made for television the Yahoos are rather less literally scatological here than on the page but for the most part this is a more adult treatment than you might expect with no real dumbing down The star cast is certainly impressive and for the most part wellused if somewhat briefly in a few cases  Mary Steenburgen James Fox Peter OToole Edward Woodward Omar Sharif Shashi Kapoor Edward Fox Ned Beatty Alfre Woodard Kristin Scott Thomas and Isabelle Huppert among them Its hard to imagine the upcoming Jack Black version even coming close to being a fraction as impressive as this
1,I had been interested in this film for a long time especially after reading a couple of online reviews of the DVD edition however I kept postponing its purchase because of the excessive pricetag and utter lack of relevant supplements When it went outofprint earlier this year I finally gave in  but the entire order which included a number of other highlydesirable titles got lost in transit luckily the DVD has been reissued at bargainprice  and Im sure glad I picked it up  Anyway this is one strange film and a genuine sleeper initially confusing but striking occult tale which manages to hit bullseye with respect to both its forbidding smalltown atmosphere and the inherent eeriness of the sinister goingson A small cast responds perfectly to a terse absorbing and intelligent script lead Strother Martin in particular makes the dialogue sound better than it actually is with his nuanced performance as the town doctorhead of the witchs coven LQ Jones and Alvy Moore both of whom also produced the film offer solid support as the nononsense sheriff and his comicstrip aficionado assistant The plot merges elements of various earlier films dealing with witchcraft and the supernatural and not only the obvious titles the fact that the town is held under a spell which cant at first be identified for instance brings instantly to mind the similar affliction of one specific bourgeois household in Luis Bunuels sublimely surreal THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL 1962 the possessed children angle was borrowed perhaps from VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED 1960 there have been many films  especially of a recent vintage  where the satanic rites of a witches coven are shown from THE CITY OF THE DEAD 1960 to THE DEVIL RIDES OUT 1968 but since the proceedings take place in modernday America albeit in remote surroundings and revolve around elderly witches seeking a renaissance the film they recall most of all is ROSEMARYS BABY 1968 The occult scenes accentuated as much by foggy exteriors as by the shadowy lighting of the garishlydecorated house where the diabolical events take place are presented in a completely matteroffact way as to make them unsettling and extremely effective  particularly the opening sequence involving an army tank crushing a car the rampage of a devildoll a concept which has been done to death over the years but here it raises an undeniable frisson a surreal dream sequence set inside the ice chamber where all the victims are kept since they cant be buried a sequence where the witches attack a doubting member of the coven a beheading committed by a horseriding medieval knight and the lengthy black mass finale with the witches accompanied by the respective child they will be taking over all dressed in red  except for a blackclad Martin presiding over the ceremony which culminates in ritual mass suicide  The film also has the guts to deliver a downbeat curtain its so refreshing to come across a title albeit a lowbudget production from a major Hollywood studio Columbia that contrives to go so completely against the grain like I said the film is quite weird  extending also to the editing and the score Its odd too that such a classy  and cinematic  horror offering sic should come from a TV director most often associated with Westerns and other family fare By the way the same theme was dealt with almost contemporaneously in the nth Christopher LeePeter Cushing collaboration NOTHING BUT THE NIGHT 1972 which Lee produced himself  a film I foolishly missed out on some 20 years back when it was shown on local TV and which has been MIA ever since  PS This review of THE BROTHERHOOD OF Satan will certainly contain spoilers but then the synopsis and artwork featured on the DVD cover manage to give everything away anyway
1,Kannathil Muthamittal is for sure a great movie I have to give it to Mani Ratnam for a great directing job and AR Rahman for great songs The camera work is just excellent and is similar to Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan I will be shocked if this movie does not win an Oscar for Best Foreign Film or even Best Camera Work
1,At first it seems the topical romance movie where a girl meets a boy and fall in love but the point is that this movie has a feeling others dont haveThe first time i saw it i couldnt see it complete because i had to leaveBut while i was walking along i thought i must see it again but i didnt have any opportunity by thenOne year went by until i saw this movie in a notfree channel and i saw it and i recorded it tooI saw it oncetwiceuntil 200 times and not kiddingI did know all the dialogues by hart and i dont know why but i saw it everyday and never got boredAnd i have to say that Im not used to see a movie more than twiceThe act is very goodGerard Depardieu is a talented actor and katherine heigl tooI would like her to be in a good movie because i think she can do itOn balanceits a movie i cant take out of my mind
1,I saw this version of Hamlet on television many years ago and have seen every other version since whether television or movie However this is the one that remains the truest depiction of the story for me Most excellent Derek Jacobi made Hamlet real for me Before I saw this version Shakespeare was simply gibberish to me and I never tried to understand the Elizabethan English Having seen Jacobis Hamlet several times not only increased my knowledge of literature but also that of my family I promptly checked the play out of Library and read it and poured over the accompanying recording Jacobis rendition attracted me to a deeper knowledge And yet I have been searing for a video of it for years and years to no avail It gets a very high rating from viewers Why then has it not been released on video Its the only Hamlet that Id invest in
1,THE MERCHANT OF FOUR SEASONS was Rainer Werner Fassbinders first shot at mainstream acceptance In a turbulent career of just fifteen years he managed to create an astounding body of work in film and theater both as a performer and a creative producer actor and director Although this movie might not appeal to many viewers the film has much to offer The storyline is fairly straightforward A man is ostracized from his upper middle class family due to emotional and economic problems and proves unable to control his downward spiral THE MERCHANT OF FOUR SEASONS is shot with a slavish devotion to elegant detail and each set is very carefully designed and constructed Every object on set seems painstakingly arranged so as to provoke layers of emotional texture Many religious paintings and icons decorate the walls of the various rooms and seem to speak to Hanss desperate quest for spiritual meaning or direction in his life Much thought was given to how lighting and color were employed to contrast and enhance the drama Several times during the film I froze the frame to marvel at the beauty of the shots composition I streamed this film and the print was nearly flawless and second to none Fassbinder employs his actors in an almost vehement AntiNatural style He does everything possible to prevent the actors from reacting in a normal or colloquial manner and this creates a rather stilted effect However by doing so he injects an almost hyperreality to the narrative Rather than the presentation of a mundane melodrama the actors almost militant lack of affectation forces the viewer to confront the film in a different manner Fassbinders film intentionally prevents the viewer from easily connecting with the characters trials and tribulations You are constantly on the outside looking in This will be a disconcerting experience for many but I found it to be a unique and satisfying artistic adventure
1,Back when in the States I was like about 7 or 8 I always woke early just to watch this together with a whole bunch of other cartoons like HootKloot The Road Runner Show The Pink Panther But this was perhaps one of the most memorable and funny animated works out there and I still find it very funny today Ill never forget the episodes like the one where two aardvarks were fighting over the can of chocolate ant pudding or the one where the aardvark is trying to reach the island where all the ants are at and my personal favorite the one where the ant the aardvark and a dog end up in an animal hospital which would later be the basis of a similar Looney Toon cartoon with Sylvester Tweety and the bulldog This is one of the most unforgettable cartoons out there in which anyone would love to revisit I would An excellent series
1,Sure the film is full of black militant stereotypes and much of the jargon of the time In that sense the movie has indeed dated But as a satirical look at Americas number one parasitical industry advertising its still on target But just as important is the counter message namely the effect of big bucks on those who would make the industry more socially responsibleno promoting war toys alcohol etc Thus the movies also about the allures of capitalism Note for example how Putneys garb suddenly changes to resemble ThirdWorld revolutionary Fidels just before he pulls out of the firm For a moment it looks like Swopes minirevolution has succeeded among his staff and hes moving on maybe to spread the movement But then the former militants succumb to the allure of big bucks and he departs shaking his head perhaps to hijack a plane to Cuba Downeys final word however is an ironical one as the Arab I believe burns down the money tower leaving the metaphorical structure of advertising capitalism a smoking ruin To me this looks like change can only succeed as a cleansing act of destruction and not as a process of reforma message consistent with the radical spirit of the time Whatever the subtext there are some genuinely funny moments especially with the commercials that play as well now as they did then Those who compare the anarchic style to that of the Marx Bros make a good point The throwaway lines fly thick and fast along with the outrageous setups Forty years later its still a hard movie to get a consistent handle on Despite the crudities however the film remains a work of daring originality with some genuinely telling moments
1,SPOILERS AHEAD  15 PARK AVENUE My Humble take on this film  Now for a viewer of cinema having tastes as severely limited as mine niche films like 15 Park Avenue ought to be palatable to my sensibilities With this thought and a mild sense of embarrassment that I hadnt watched the complete film earlier I watched this film last Saturday There are some starting similarities with other works like the legendary Mulholland Drive David Lynch from which this film borrows at least 3 concepts  a That at least some truths are relative b The first scene of Shabana and Konkonam going around in a car as the opening credits roll is uncannily similar to the car ride that Betty and Rita undertook in Mulholland Drive In both cases the object of inquiry happens to be a place which is probably mythical in both cases and perhaps more openly symbolic in Aparnas film c The incident revolving around the mad beggar woman is again extremely reminiscent of the whole occurence behind Winkies involving a bum but while that scary creature is an embodiment of something and that that something as well as the character per Se is seamlessly linked to other works of Lynch notice carefully the disheveled long hair the effect of the beggar woman in 15 PA appears to be a tribute and therefore insignificant in the context of the film and its message  The other films from which 15 PA also borrows is Blow Up especially the last scene is a throw back to the truth Vs perceived truth poser presented towards the end of Antonionis masterpiece Of course the professor and schizophrenia angle also bring to the mind A Beautiful mind Although admittedly the subject here is high brow physics and Shabana who professes it inadvertently ends up being the brilliant antithesis to the delusional hallucinations of Konkonas character through those very prophecies In an outstanding scene in the movie some of these elements are juxtaposed with each other and that scene cuts back and forth from the real world of Shabana where Quantum Physics and the Theory of Relativity justify the finiteness and composition of the universe to the artificial edifice of the make believe world of Mithi But for all their differences the sisters are alike too Both are incapable of forming long lasting relationships one out of choice and the other out of nature So Mithis pain at being rejected in love by Joydeep is in harmony with the inability of Shaban to form a special bond with either KunalDhritiman or Sanjeev Kanwaljeet But Im getting ahead of myself Viewers generally tend to view this film in one of the following two ways  Hypothesis 1 It was Shabana all along There is a certain section of the audience who think so But that explanation is not only too far fetched but also contrived as that would mean she was dreaming up so many other characters too ie all those characters whom she visualized as visualizing Mithi along with her  Hypothesis 2 There WAS a REAL Mithi and the ending is a metaphor This POV says that the films essence is summarized in one dialog in the film when in response to a statement by Joy Rahul Bose that Mithi is looking for something that she will never find his wife Laxmi Shefali Shah philosophizes that we all are looking indeed for that illusive utopia the end of the rainbow wherein appears to lie the mirage of happiness and contentment  There are other more minor possibilities which have not been embraced that much by our knowledgeable audience like  Hypothesis 3 Shabana and Konkona are alter egos of the same person Hypothesis 4 Shabana too is a figment of Mithis imagination Hypothesis 5 The old haggard perhaps mad beggar woman is the real protagonist of the story  Are these hypotheses worthy of even being tested Well your guess is as good as mine  Why 15 Park Avenue Contrary to the popular perception that she was thinking of the Park Avenue in NY I believe that she got the name from the brand name of a semi popular bathing soap Remember her stating Jo Jos profession as Prime minister of Shikakai which as you may be knowing is a popular ingredient used in manufacturing Shampoos The prefix 15 is used as it was on 15th December that Mithi got engaged to Joydeep and after his walkout she remains forever in a time warp The film has its fair share of flaws lack of use of a strong background score which in films like these can really augment the narrative some sloppy dialogs unabated by some forced dialog delivery Inconsistent performances Shabana and Dhritimaan are excellent though IMO by a few of the cast members albeit many members of this ensemble cast have been wasted Shefali Chayas sudden insecurity about her husband seems to be an unimaginatively introduced dimension in the plot I give it 710 as it made me think but not any higher than that because I can easily fathom its sources of inspiration and having experienced and for the most part thoroughly enjoyed those previously I have already thought on similar lines earlier So the experience post 15 PA is bound to be sans a certain degree of novelty Where am I coming from I gave 9510 to 36 Chowringhee Lane though rumors still persist that one Satyajit Ray ghost directed it 75 to Paromiter Ek Din 7 to Mr and Mrs Iyer and 5 to Paroma On an existential level it failed to invoke my interest not even as much as say a Truman Show
1,I cannot hate on the show When the old and better tech TV had to hit the bricks the channel was reformatted and new shows stepped in Attack of the Show is the replacement for the Screen Savers with 3 cohosts in the beginning They were Kevin Rose Kevin Pereira and Sarah Lane Brendan Moran came to be something of a cohost as well but he mostly did prerecorded pieces for the show Kevin Rose decided to leave the show and eventually there was a contest to see who would be the third host but that didnt pan out for some reason Eventually I just learned this from this very IMDb messageboard Sarah Lane and Brendan Moran moved on because hey this is what I read the two got married That was a big secret to me Now there is a new female cohost the notashot my opinion Olivia Munn Shes hiding something in those tops she wears while Sarah Lane had a perfect body and she wasnt afraid to show it AHEM Sorry Attack of the Show deals with everything young people want to know about Its music movies comic books the internet and television This is whats great about the show If you dont want to bother with scouring the net or waste time watching MTV you can get all you want on AOTS Some segments and bits they do are funny They have regular guests and contributors who are in the industry as well as guests who range from insignificant internet stars to actual big names Even though the hosts arent as geek as Id like them to be I still have found Attack of the Show to be entertaining even with its latest lineup
1,The Violent Men marked the finest collaboration of Rudolph Maté with Glenn Ford in an intensely satisfying drama of rugged primitive justice  Ford is John Parrish a former Cavalry captain who is itching to get married and start a new life His fiancée Caroline Vail May Wynn is desperate to move east and to see him selling his spread to Lee Wilkison Edward G Robinson Parrish is not even much of a cattleman but he do understand that there is something big building up in the valley In the Army they used to call it enemy pressure First Cole Wilkison Brian Keith comes back from Texas to help his brother run Anchor Then a tough kid with a fancy gun Richard Jaeckel shows up on the Wilkison payroll Then all the small ranchers are forced out getting the same kind of offers Parrish saw himself either running like they did or stand and fight But can he easily deals with a man who sends six killers to shoot an old man in the back Can he easily argues with a man who started with a few acres of land and now owns practically the whole valley  All that grass and sand ever meant to the exConfederate Army officer the past three years It was a place to regain his health Out of habit of taking advice Parrish affirms What happen in this valley is no concern of mine And much to the disappointment of the remaining ranchers and farmers who pressure him to stay on he decides to accept Wilkisons offer to fulfill the promise he made to his fiancée When Lees younger brother Cole made the wrong move trying to push Parrish make up his mind by lynching one of his ranch hands Parrish got mad and warns the two brothers that he is going to stay and will fight them for the privilege of being let alone  Brian Keith plays the traitorous brother whos behind the killing He dreams to have position and respect in running one day Anchor  Lees ambitious wife Martha Barbara Stanwyck secretly hates herself and her husband Stanwyck plays the part of a loving wife who cant bear the touch of her husbands hands  Edward G Robinson is good enough as the Anchors crippled owner who promised the whole valley to his wife unaware that she is having an affair with his younger brother Dianne Foster is too sensitive as the unsociable adult daughter well aware of her mothers burdens  The Violent Men uses the widescreen technology to emphasize the scope and power of this harrowing actiondrama making it a perfect example of the genres most enduring classics
1,If this film doesnt at least be selected for an oscar nominee for best foreign film Im going to stop waking at nights watching the event Fridrik Thor Fridriksson has proven that money isnt the key to making a good movie but originality Out of a cold country comes a warm but thoughtprovoking film of a mentally ill man and his struggle against an insane world After an insight like this you question whether or not the man is crazy or the world he lives in
1,This is an incredible piece of drama and powerful which hits you I found the film was great and getting to grips with the two main characters disability this was represented in a great performance by both two Michael and Rory Whether the story is based around a true story I feel the story was trying to giving the audience a message that as a whole the general public should respect and feel for the needs of disabled people and that they should be given the same chance as any other human On the whole this film reach into my soul and I too felt touched by the actors and the director sending out there creativity The whole picture is that some actors take it beyond their character the play and only show part of the character that is believable to the audience but I feel that theses two certainly made great use as their gifted talent to portray a masterpiece piece of drama Certainly one not to be missed
1,Being a huge diehard Monkey Island fan I fugured this one would be terrible since Ron Gilbert didnt make it Boy was I surprised Although its still not as good as the first two it has the comedy that I wanted I was a little nervous about the new graphics new SCUMM engine and just the fact that it was on a CD But it all came together and it was interesting to finally hear the voices of your favorite characters I especially enjoyed that SWORD FIGHTING had returned And the whole story about finding the big uncursed ring was just incredible Go ahead and try out this twoCD adventure And now we can rejoice because Monkey Island 4Escape from Monkey Island is coming out REALLY REALLY soon This fall
1,One of the myths of the early sound era is that they couldnt make Westerns because they had trouble recording sound on location In fact it was the financial restrictions of the depression that temporarily killed off the genre at least in the A budget bracket However in the period 19291931 before the economic downturn had really kicked in the A Western flourished notable examples including The Virginian Billy the Kid and Cimarron The Big Trail was perhaps the biggest of them all  a gargantuan pioneer Western shot in an early widescreen process appropriately titled grandeur Thanks to a recent DVD release we now get to see the widescreen version alongside the fullscreen that was shot simultaneously The director was Raoul Walsh a man for whom the spirit of adventure lay in vast outdoor vistas and thus in many ways a perfect choice He makes great use of the wider frame to show off the Western landscape at its most breathtaking Very typical of Walsh are a number of shots towards the beginning such as the one where a woman is chopping firewood Most of the screen is tightly filled by the wagons and other clutter but in one corner we see the wilderness stretching out invitingly When the wagon train gets going the open plain is gradually revealed to us with wagons pulling away like stage curtains These shots are not so effective in the fullscreen version yet on the wider canvas Walshs expression of the outdoors was never better But theres an unfortunate flipside to this When it comes to dialogue scenes Walshs tendency is to place the actors in the middle of the shot as if they were in an imaginary fullscreen box The extra width becomes just that  extra It may seem logical at first because it means that heightwise we see as much of the actors as we would in a fullscreen picture However it makes the players look small and insignificant within the frame while all the background business dominates the shot  and there is a lot of background business in the Big Trail When widescreen formats reemerged in the 1950s many directors would make the same mistake before eventually realising that in talkie scenes it is better to frame actors from around the chest up losing some of their height but allowing them to fill the screen Its a pity because The Big Trail is a particularly wellbalanced and finely scripted effort The romance and revenge subplots are simple but well defined and do not threaten to overbalance each other or the pioneer story It could have been a great intimate epic but it loses dramatic weight because every time characters start talking to each other we get distracted by herds of cattle drifting wagons or whatever else is filling every spare inch of frame Still Walshs sensitivity to deeply emotional romantic moments is still on display and he manages to make the final scene effective and memorable There are also some nice comedy touches largely courtesy of comical Swede El Brendel The Big Trail is also notable for being John Waynes first lead role While Wayne is another victim of the distant framing in dialogue scenes we do at least see his strong physical presence and hear his warm but assertive vocal delivery He betrays his lack of experience but the potential is clearly there Sadly that potential wasnt widely realised at the time and he spent the rest of the decade slumming it in Bpictures before he finally hit stardom Also appearing in this picture is Waynes buddy and later prolific character actor Ward Bond Hes not credited but you can spot him in a number of scenes most prominently around the 80minute mark where he is stood to Tyrone Powers left The Big Trail is a glorious epic that manages to defeat itself as a drama And it was this stupendous scale that would put the Western and widescreen to bed for some time And although the 40s and 50s are now regarded as the golden age of the Western it was by then a changed genre with stories of individual adventure and heroism in an established West  no better or worse but of a different form The early talkie period was the end of an era in which Westerns could be truly gigantic
1,If you have ever babysat in a house you didnt know or if you saw the original and enjoyed it then this will be a good choice Ignoring the reviews and what was posted here I went ahead and rented this movie because of the memories of how the original scared me as a teen This movie has of coursechanged some of the original story to relate to todays teens such as the babysitter is in trouble for going over on her cell phone minutes and has to take on a babysitting job to pay her bill However it sticks to the original story line pretty well If you can relate to the babysitter not knowing the house and its usual pops and cracks it is quite suspenseful When the killer is shown he is very creepy and you find yourself yelling at the girl to GET OUT OF THE HOUSE If you have never babysat or been in a situation like this then you probably will not be able to relate and will not like it Its all about understanding her fear

1,A recent survey of children in the UK reenforced the notion put forth by this film 27 years ago That being more than anything else young people want to grow up to be somebody famous It used to be doctors and firemen that kids wanted to be Now everyone wants to be famous Fame is a story of a group of kids accepted into the High School for Performing Arts in New York City We seen them first audition then take classes and learn about life for the next four years The film has a lot of fine qualities but ultimately leaves you feeling a little unsatisfied Alan Parkers bold directorial style fits the story pretty well The film has been classified as a musical but more than anything it is a drama Musical numbers and dance routines break out here and there and Parker keeps them as close to realistic as they really could have been filmed The acting is for the most part topdrawer with a few exceptions The pacing is a little off particularly toward the end of the film but by that point the story has already taken a few wrong turns anyway First off the auditions at the beginning of the film should have weeded a couple of the principle characters out It seems unlikely that anyone would show up and audition for one department then stumble their way through admissions to another Some of these people just dont look that talented or interested to begin with Once the first year of classes gets going the film settles into a nice groove The interaction between students and teachers is very well handled and it leaves you wanting more The film begins to lose itself later on as we see more and more of the students lives out of school Some of these people just arent worth caring about The films biggest mistake is making the Ralph Garcy character so prominent This guy is a boorish selfcentered jerk A professional ahole as he proudly declares on stage during his comedy routines The audience is supposed to somehow feel for this guy and his tragic personal situation but I was just hoping theyd throw his butt out of school Irene Cara Maureen Teefy Paul McCrane and the late Gene Anthony Ray are the people youll care about by the time this film is over Try as I might I still cant develop abs like Gene Anthony Ray had in this film Overall this film is good It is memorable interesting and full of daring scenes and performances It runs maybe a little too long and perhaps some of the wrong characters get fully developed while others kind of hover in the background The musical numbers are great and there is even a surprise or two waiting to be discovered by the time the film is over Though not perfect Fame will be a film that lives on in one way or another for many years to come 7 of 10 stars The Hound
1,Two Soldiers is an excellent example of fine filmmaking The director and producer took a heartwarming story and brought it to life with a very skilled and dedicated cast excellent cinematography and very creative artistry The relaxed backwoods lifestyle of the brothers was depicted with great details and contrasted sharply with the militaristic lifestyle that they were thrust into The interaction between the brothers brought laughter and tears as they struggled with a hard but peaceful life in the backwoods of North Carolina and an even harder life of war The acting was great particularly from the younger brother who is new to the big screen played by Jonathan Furr to the older brother played by Ben Allison and the powerful perfomrance by the Colonel played by Ron Perlman The performance was extremely well cast It was a pleasure to enjoy the magic of Two Soldiers and I heartily recommend it to audiences of all ages
1,One way or the other you cant get away from the basic message The strong survive Those who are psychically or emotionally sensitive leave They leave a hole behind in the lives of those who love them A hole that is seen in its finality as selfish Thats what Phoebe realizes in the end Just prior to helping Wolf heal from his selfblame She can accept closure to the missing of her sister Beautiful European scenery A lot of truth in it about idealism and addiction to the next big moment For a moment I thought of the BaaderMeinhoff gang who was around in the early 70s I liked this movie as it reflected a time when I came of age myself
1,In New York a group of freshmen join the High School for the Performing Arts after being well succeeded in their audition For four years their dreams deceptions success love and personal dramas are disclosed though the insecure Doris Finsecker Maureen Teefy the homosexual Montgomery Payl McCrane the aggressive Leroy Gene Anthony Ray the hopeful Coco Irene Cara the ambitious Ralph Garci Barry Miller and their friends until their graduation day Twentyeight years ago Fame was a great success with the story of teenagers seeking a spot in the show business and I loved this movie and the soundtrack on CD I have just watched Fame on DVD and presently I would say that it is a good movie with a great potential only but with too many flawed subplots The story follows too many characters and leaves many situations without answer I do not know whether Alan Parker had edition problems to reduce the running time of this movie but what happened for example with the ballerina that goes to a clinic for abortion What happened with Leroy and his teacher did he fail due to his grammar problem What happened with Coco after undressing her blouse in the apartment of that crook The musician that plays synthesizer and his proud father are left behind in the subplot Anyway Fame is still a delightful entertainment and a cultmovie for me My vote is seven Title Brazil Fama Fame
1,As a camera operator I couldnt help but admire the great look that this picture achieved The performances were excellent as was the story Just when I thought this film was about to slow down it didnt Heartpounding tension great pacing through editing and a score that knows when to be quiet all come together here under competent and capable direction The camera was always in the right place Love that
1,What is often neglected about Harold Lloyd is that he was an actor Unlike Chaplin and Keaton Lloyd didnt have the VaudevilleMusic Hall background and he wasnt a natural comedian He came to Hollywood to act and he discovered he had a knack for acting funny  first in shorts then in features He made a name for himself as Lonesome Luke a Chaplin knockoff with the glasses character that made him the allAmerican boy rather than a grotesque Lloyd found his stride and his movies became some of the best produced during the silent era He developed a reputation as a daredevil in some shorts and retained this in some of his best movies Safety Last For Heavens Sake Girl Shy He was more popular than either Chaplin or Keaton during the twenties and he became very rich before the advent of sound The first sound movies were often disasters To get the most out of their sound too much dialog was used in many movies Lloyds acting skills were after two decades geared for silents He didnt have a bad voice its high pitch suited his glasses character And his sound films werent the unqualified disasters of legend Yet silent movies had been raised to a high art especially Lloyds which did not stint on budget and were extremely wellcrafted with the introduction of talkies movies had to learn to walk again and they made some missteps Though he tried to move with the times and embraced sound Lloyds best bits from his early overly talky talkies were still visual  such as the scene in Movie Crazy where he appears to be riding in a swank car but actually hitched a ride on his bicycle Trying to recapture the daredevil antics that made him famous as he did in Feet First was misstep In Safety Last his best movie and the one that deservedly or not shoved Lloyd in the box as a daredevil comic he played a determined young man climbing to the top Safety Last had a natural structure that ascended to his characters scaling the side of the building He was obviously afraid but his fear added to the humor In Feet First he arrived in a precarious buildingscaling position by accident his frantic cries for help detracted from the humor His character was pathetic and cringing aspiration to save his neck  possibly an accurate statement of the 1930s but not amusing Harold Lloyd was not mired in the past like some wacky Norma Desmond He embraced sound and tried to take his movies in different directions growing and changing with the industry When Feet First failed he left the daredevil business and made a satire on the talking movie industry Movie Crazy Just as he had to flounder through many movies as Lonesome Luke before carving his place in movie history with the glasses character he had tried several directions in sound movies before hitting his stride in sound which he did with The Catspaw In The Catspaw he plays a missionarys son reared in China who unwittingly gets elected mayor as a front for corrupt political interests When he finds out the truth he sets himself the task of cleaning up the town Only in his early forties Lloyd could still act the brash young man Yet The Catspaw was another boxoffice failure and Lloyd made only three more movies including The Milky Way Of his chief competitors Chaplin still had silent movies in him and Keaton was hopelessly mismanaged The Catspaw and The Milky Way suggest Lloyd might have mastered sound comedy if he had been a little younger or if audiences had given him the benefit of the doubt after his early sound fiascoes Though the movie has been unfairly maligned about the way Lloyds character cleaned up the town it suits him From his days in shorts Lloyd wanted to scare his audience and the climax of The Catspaw achieved it yet again in a surprising way until the trick is revealed it appears gruesome and then come the laughs Viewed as a product of its time The Catspaw is charming and funny A very wellwritten sound comedy wellacted by Lloyd Directed by Sam Taylor its curious blend of drama and sly humor make it look almost like a Frank Capra or Preston Sturges comedy
1,There I was on vacation when my host suggested we take in this BMovie festival in Breda I was resistant as I hadnt gone on the trip to sit in a movie theater but Ive got to admit that I dont regret a second of this one especially with Stephen Malkmus contribution It probably helped that I had no idea what to expect SEA OF DUST starts out like a typical costume drama Weve got a young medical student going to help a doctor whose town is being destroyed by a crazy plague which somehow involves exploding heads On the way he stops to visit his fiancé and gets thrown off the property by her father Traveling on he finds a girl lying on the road another plague victim and takes her along to the doctors Yawn I thought It all seemed pretty predicable And then everything went crazy and it suddenly turned into a completely different film Tom Savini shows up looking like Dracula characters begin traveling to the other side of reality and the dialog gets increasingly humorous And just when I thought it had settled into a groove the picture changes again becoming really dark and bizarre I wont spoil it for first time viewers but theres an amazing sequence about hollow people lots of chat about the abuse of religion by society and some overthetop gore effects And did I mention Stephen Malkmus This isnt a perfect movie in case you havent figured that out from its appearance at a BMovie festival but its well worth the time for adventurous viewers Great visuals cool soundtrack lots of interesting ideas The acting is a little zany at times but I think thats the point Funny I had to go to Breda to see find an American picture that looked like a British horror movie You figure that one out
1,If you go into the Twins Effect looking for a pure Hong Kong movie experience you will be disappointed This is not to say it is bad but it is NOT a traditional Hong Kong action movie running in a similar vein to Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle Its resolutely silly and juvenile so if you want a good bit of serious Hong Kong action look to a John Woo or Yuen Woo Ping movie This movies got a lot of flak for its silliness and I thought the first thing I should do would be to explain what youre getting into as its disappointed a lot of purists For the nonpurists and those with more forgiving tastes though Twins Effect is a delightfully silly kungfu comedy I liked it a lot for a variety of reasons not least its wonderful female leads who spark off each other in a thoroughly entertaining comedy double act I believe this is the first movie of its type theyve been in but they hop kick and fly about like seasoned pros The patently ridiculous plot is handled with a great deal of care and attention and the movie is quite knowingly written making a lot of the movie laugh out loud The comedy really is the most prominent thing here and its a subtle gentle comedy as reliant on words as inanimate objects going flying a la Stephen Chow It has to be said the slapstick is immense fun too The sequence with the discodancing vampires is a total classic The action is a blend of two genres really It falls between the period drama wireandsword fighting which comes in more toward the end and the comedy fighting style of Jackie Chan coming out with a blend that though a little derivative at times is always exciting to watch and occasionally throws up some genuinely innovative encounters All this is great and the movie is tremendous fun all the way through Despite this it does have a few sticking points For instance Twins Effect is in many ways much more westernised than kungfu fans are perhaps used to the inevitable comparison to the Blade series is definitely sound as an example though Twins Effect is honestly much better than Blade ever managed especially for fighting action Personally it was also a bit of a shame to see the excellent Anthony Wong the hissable villain from John Woos classic Hard Boiled so underused but the younger audience this is aimed at are unlikely to notice this or indeed know about Hard Boiled or his other movies so this is only really a personal gripe If you watch this with an open mind youll probably enjoy it greatly like I did but you must be firmly aware it is a COMEDY not a balls to the wall kungfu movie Keep that in mind and youll be fine
1,An unflinching descent into psychological and physical oblivion that will undoubtedly burn images of the truthful brutality and suffering of war into your cerebral cortex in a way not many other films will In fact there is simply no other war film like it Director Kon Ichikawa witnessed the unthinkable horror of Hiroshima first hand only 10 days after the bomb was dropped He has said that from that day it would always be his mission to express the pointless empty violence humans inflict on each other and themselves  Mr Ichikawa shows us that there are no winners in war for the paths to victory and defeat are paved with the same soldiers soullessly marching down roads which only have death and destruction at their end Mr Ichikawa succeeds in bringing his message to the world thru this haunting piece of cinema
1,an awesome made for the scifi channel movie which by far surpasses many of the poor previous efforts theyve churned out Bruce Campbell is on superb form as a possible investor who gets caught up in a bizarre experiment led by a delirious professorStacey Keachand his halfwit assistanceTed Raimi The film is pure b movie gold and its great to see Keach and ram up on screen with Bruce and the fact that a lot of the film works purely on Bruces comic slapstick acting is what make it hilarious and makes me ask the question why isnt this guy getting more of his scripts commissioned it indeed a sick world Definitely worth a watch
1,i loved the great lighting and was warmed by this story of American working class society and seaport life in the first half of the 20th century i was drawn in by the timeless watchability of this realistic performance see and feel the star power melancholic greek comedy Anybody in the mood for a shot with a beer backor a little ginger Hey waterboy 
1,Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable
1,During the War for Southern Independence GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes his forces to defend the local women  children against a Yankee invasion In 1936 Hal Roach decided it was time for his popular OUR GANG kids to branch out into occasional featurelength films With the big success of Shirley Temple in two Civil War period movies in 1935 THE LITTLE COLONEL THE LITTLEST REBEL it was only natural that Roach would look in that same direction for his GANG Although given a rather lavish production and distributed by MGM GENERAL SPANKY was not a critical or boxoffice success The little GANGsters would henceforth stick to short subjects Although hes given top billing  the title role George Spanky McFarland is rivaled throughout the films first half by little Billie Buckwheat Thomas Here were two of the finest young actors to ever appear in American movies With all the experience of old seasoned pros these two gamin could steal scenes  hearts with equal bravado A constant joy without a false note between them they provide the essential reason for watching the film today Phillips Holmes gives a quiet gentlemanly performance as Spankys adult protector Nearly forgotten now Holmes was a fine actor who died much too soon during World War Two Genial Ralph Morgan is especially good as a sympathetic Union general  his scenes with Spanky are quite amusing Other OUR GANGers appear midpoint into the movie most notably Carl Alfalfa Switzer he gets to warble Just Before The Battle Mother Even pretty Rosina Lawrence the GANGs schoolmarm shows up to play Holmes beloved Irving Pichel is particularly slimy as a cowardly cardsharp turned vindictive Yankee captain Bumbling Willie Best  feisty Louise Beavers play Miss Lawrences slaves It should be noted that there is racism in the film not unusual for Hollywood of that era  but almost completely missing in the original series of OUR GANG shorts Fans of 19th Century music will enjoy paying attention to the soundtrack which is a long succession of ancient tunes
1,This is perhaps the television series with the greatest potential of any series around The production values are in a class of their own The characters are rounded and interesting This is entertainment at its best Some of the aliens are quite grotesque but there is an underlying humour which makes it unmissable I hope that this series goes on for many years and will have many spinoffs Science Fiction has had its bad press some justified but this is truly a flagship science fiction series and I thank Henson for it Top marks
1,This Is one of my favourite westerns What a cast Glenn Ford plays his role In his usual mild controlled but firm manner Ford plays one of the smaller ranchers In the shadow of the mighty anchor ranch that wants to swallow up the whole territory Edward G Robinson plays the crippled patriarch of the anchor ranch and Barbera Stanwyck plays his sly scheming wife There Is plenty of action In this western that Is quite Impressive the scenery Is delicious and the letterbox scope photography Is breath taking and the soundtrack Is stereo I would say that this western had a sizeable budget It looks expensive One of a series of great Glenn Ford westerns
1,Dont Torture a Duckling is one of the coolest Italian horror films Ive ever seen and Ive seen my share To call it a giallo is a little misleading because its not really a typical murder mystery Its more of a straight horror movie Complete with one of the most brutal and gory scenes ever in a movie this old Fulcis twisting and turning film oozes with a creepy ambiance and an old school Italian feel The setting is perfect an old Italian village The music is ridiculously perfect The finale is genuine and original After seeing Dont Torture a Duckling you really have to wonder how Fulcis later stuff got so off beat I like all his stuff but he strayed Maybe he figured he already did itBecause with this film he hits the bullseye Id recommend this film to anyone who thinks that Dario Argento owns the giallo genre Fulci beats him with this one  10 out of 10 kids
1,Its just that Chucky 1 was good Chucky 2 was better Chucky 3 sucked Now the 4th in the series which is in my opinion the best out of the series Jennifer Tilly was just great in this movie For dolls they were better than a few actors that come to mind Freddie Prince Jr for one and funnier than many comedies Ive seen in the past The plot wasnt great but I really didnt care about it Just to see Chucky and Tiffany bicker and fight each other And the ending leaves it wide open for a 5th sequel which I hear is in the works Idle Hands premiers next week and looks to be another horrorcomedy but I doubt itll top this one
1,I first saw this film when released in 1980 From other sources Ive learnt that the only release of the 219minute cut was in New York City after which it was severely cut to 149 minutes So I guess I saw the shorter version first which at the time I thought was a very interesting antiWestern if a trifle confusing So it was with even more interest that I finally obtained a DVD of the fulllength version Im glad I did because this second viewing has confirmed for me that the movie is a true classic and the critical vitriol poured on Michael Cimino was unwarranted to say the very least Yes its a long movie but so have been many others For example Once upon a time in America 1984 at 227 minutes Cleopatra 1963 at 320 minutes The Ten Commandments 1956 at 220 minutes Spartacus restored version 1960 at 198 minutes Gone with the Wind 1939 at 222 minutes and others So it cant be the fact of running time that made so many froth at the mouth way back when Heavens Gate came on the scene But note this all of those above movies have everything to do with reinforcing myths about history and heroes Not so Heavens Gate in this narrative the American West is shown in all its grim and unrelenting harshness injustice and poverty And thats probably the first reason why so many disliked this film it laid out the circumstances of the Johnson County War of 1892 in Wyoming showing how the Wyoming Stock Growers Association hired 50 assassins to hunt down and murder a large group of European immigrants accused of cattle rustling and all with the assistance and conniving of authorities right up to the President of the United States For an essay on that war with the background and what happened there is a link at Wikipedia under Johnson County War Very few like to be reminded of the really dirty periods in their countrys history and which fly in the face of what the country is supposed to be Had it been a documentary it would have been barely palatable for most as entertainment it was almost bound to fail commercially and be torn to shreds by the shrill and infamous Leaving aside the sociopolitical diatribe for a moment that Cimino launched herein what about the narrative  the story of the three main characters Well it probably wasnt unusual for men of that time to fall for a local prostitute just as its probably not unusual now Its a fairly standard love triangle whereby Ella must choose between the two men and ultimately decides upon the younger man Nathan who although not above resorting to coldblooded murder when it suits him shows more spirit and commitment than the older James or Jim as most people in the film say For some that part of the story threads too slowly perhaps in the context of the wider narrative about the war however it is I think entirely appropriate And that war is depicted graphically viciously and cruelly with scenes of carnage that are exquisitely staged and edited flawlessly  although in the final massacre between the Association and the immigrants Im certain that some scenes of wagons blowing apart are repeated A minor point and perhaps brought about when the 219minute cut was restored Any way you look at it though it hits you in the face with the noise dust chaos and confusion of war Which brings me to another criticism by others the noise and dust is such that its often difficult to hear the dialog and even see clearly what is happening Ill admit that I found that to be a trifle annoying at first even backtracking to replay parts to try to catch the image or the words  until I realized that really wasnt necessary if you accept the directors intent life is chaotic it is difficult to hear and see in crowded situations and in war its the sine qua non of this miseenscene In short its as though you truly are present in and within the scenes And what of the title From Shakespeare it refers to a figurative nearness to God and so if you equate God with the natural world the stunning scenery that pervades the movie  and it is stunning hauntingly equal to that of David Leans Doctor Zhivago 1965  is a useful metaphor I tend to think however that Cimino had something more to say namely the idea that the brave immigrants  the Godfearing salt of the earth  were denied entry to heaven on earth and the freedom to build a life for themselves in the land that espouses to be freedoms champion Was that Ciminos intent  to gut the myth of the American West To show how in America only the rich get rich while the poor are massacred one way or another throughout history Is that anything new Not really as we all know Where it really hurt however is in showing how America was not and by implication is not the land of the free and the home of the brave Instead after absorbing this narrative we are left with an impression that the underpinnings of America have more to do with a land of dispossessed slaves and a home for knaves
1,Strike Force or The Librarians is a fun action movie that doesnt it take itself too seriously William Forsythe stars as Simon who is looking for a missing daughter of a wealthy client He meets up with Sandi Erika Eleniak who is also looking for someoneher sister But there are evil bad guys afoot The most evil of them all is Marcos Canarious Andrew Divoff Marcos likes to kill people So now Simon and Sandi have to team up to bring down the villains The whole cast is great with Divoff stealing the movie There are also cameos by Ed Lauter and Burt Reynolds If you are looking for a good action film watch this and have a good time
1,The directing is brilliant the casting is remarkable though I wouldve loved to have seen a little more of Aaron Lustig from Y  R fame who played Paul Shaffer I only have two minor quips about the film as subtle as they are One Roebucks Leno is excellent but his stage presence ie during what appears the taping of one of his late show episodes is a tad underwhelming Two the distribution of the foul language I am willing to tolerate foul language so long as it is not used gratuitously and to a degree the film was gratuitous The language seemed to be used as a tool to reduce the pathos of Bates otherwise wellportrayed Kushnick by her frequent use of it and served to make Roebucks Leno a goodygoody by his lack of use of it of course if the characters really did behave this way kudos to everybody Nonetheless the piece is an excellent one as far as television and video are concerned The film I feel had potential for the big screen but wouldve required recasting for the bit parts and probably a different director as well the aesthetic feel is that of the Larry Sanders show good for HBO mediocre for cinematic purposes
1,I went into a screening of SISTER HELEN at the Sundance Film Festival and did not know what to expect I was riveted by the people in this documentary Sister Helen is an incredible character The filmmakers captured the essence of Sister Helens amazing soul and took me into a world unknown I was thoroughly satisfied by the journey and was completely caught off guard by this films ending This film speaks to those who desire a second chance at life
1,This is the most difficult movie I have ever seenthe emotional content is horrific yet unforgetable A woman who is accused of being a political activist is brought in for questioning The whole movie revolves around her interrogation Alan Rickman and Madeline Stowe have intense and powerful roles for which they deserve Oscars for their performances
1,As a French i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that at some defaults of Westerners at Spy movies etcand at a lot of other things too en route I already saw it 3 times and each time i discovered new things and laughed to tears Jean Dujardin Bérénice Béjo Aure Atika the director and all the cast all the crew did a fantastic job This movie is funny but is although much more than that  its got plenty of levels to it You laugh because of simple gags because of some critics made with wit the movies courageous enough to be critical because of physical comedy because you believe in the characters etc Esthetically and musically its a success too Go see it if you can
1,The best of everything Just what is the best of everything It is different for everyone but for most of us it is love But alas not everyone knows where or who to look to for real love This story goes the whole gambit of looking for love Sometimes in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons But as the saying goeswe are the captains of our own ships and so it goes for our lives We are responsible for the choices that we make in our lives Once we make those choices then we must live with them As we watch this story and as we see these women making choices that most likely change their lives forever we wonder would we make the same choices as these women or would we be wiser Who knows

1,I agree with Andy this is a good movie Kevin McKidds character is believable throughout the film Were forced to hate him and latterly sympathise with him Paula Sage who plays Roberta puts in a good performance too Its thoughtprovoking and emotive without any slush overproduction Credit to director Alison Peebles and writer Andrea Gibb for that A very worthwhile viewing The pace of the film is just right raising just enough interest in the subject matter to reel you in rather than bombard you with facts in a documentary style Nice little soundtrack to go with the film too again used sparingly not to distract you from storyline Recommended
1,An on screen caption informs us that it is the Caribbean Sea May 1891 A small lifeboat drifts aimlessly at sea containing six convicts from a shipwrecked prison ship and the ships Doctor a Lt Claude De Ross Claudio Cassinelli Its night a strange current takes the boat towards a strange unnamed and uncharted island The boat hits some rocks and is torn apart One of the prisoners is killed by what appears to be a slimy mutant fishman creature The next morning morning Claude wakes up to find himself washed upon a beach He finds a pool of white bubbling water and one of the prisoners dead beside it Claude warns another surviving prisoner Jose Franco Iavarone not to drink the water as it will kill him They both eventually meet up with the other surviving prisoners Peter Roberto Posse Francois Francesco Mazzeri and Skip Giuseppe Castellano Francois wanders off on his own to try and catch an animal for food he finds and kills a large water bird But in turn he is killed himself by one of the fishmen Claude Jose Peter and Skip continue to explore the island as they put Francoiss death down to an animal attack of some sort Soon after Skip is killed when he is impaled on a spike at the bottom of a pit Now only Claude Jose and Peter are left They stumble across a cemetery with lots of empty graves and signs of recent black magic rituals Claude spots a snake on a nearby rock suddenly a shot is heard and the snakes head explodes A woman on horseback named Amanda Marvin Barbara Bach is revealed to be Claudes saviour She tells them to leave the island immediately as it is owned by a Edmund Rackham Richard Johnson and he doesnt like visitors Claude Jose and Peter decide to carry on regardless eventually finding Rackhams large house in which they are invited to stay That night Peter goes after Amanda and tries to rape her in a swamp Peter quickly becomes food for the fishmen And a Voodoo priestess called Shakira Beryl Cunningham who lives with Rackham performs a black magic ritual involving slitting the throat of a chicken at the cemetery The next day Claude and Jose decide they should leave the island as they feel very uneasy about Rackham and think he is lying to them Jose rides off on horseback and is lost Claude is saved from one of the fishmen by Amanda and is again told to leave Claude wants to confront Rackham again Rackham reveals that he has a scientist and Amandas father named Professor Ernest Marvin Joseph Cotten who he needs to be kept alive Rackham says that the longer Ernest stays alive the chances of his own survival will dramatically increase Rackham tells Claude his plan Rackham has found the lost city of Atlantis at a depth of over 2000 feet He is using the fishmen as a means of getting at the lost treasures of Atlantis and needs Amanda and her father to control them He claims the fishmen are descendants of the original inhabitants of Atlantis Rackham offers Claude a share of the treasure if he will help him keep Ernest alive Later Claude remembers the name Ernest Marvin as a scientist who was condemned for experiments transplanting animal organs into human beings Finding Ernests secret laboratory he discovers Rackham had lied to him and the fishmen arent descendants their actually genetically altered people turned into amphibious creatures by Ernests grotesque experiments Rackham has finally had enough of Claude and decides to put an end to his meddling by sticking him in a large tank and slowly filling it with water as the islands volcano starts to erupt and send lava flying everywhere Rackham wants to leave the island with his treasures and Amanda will Claude escape almost certain death to save Amanda and get off the island before the erupting volcano tears it apart Directed by Sergio Martino I really liked this film that mixes various genres The script by Sergio Donati is fast paced interesting and entertaining The plot is revealed bit by bit which kept me interested in watching it all the way through I must say at this point that Ive seen the original version and not the one with added scenes inserted for its US release by Roger Corman Barbara Bach makes for an extremely attractive leading lady but I hated the way she was introduced by shooting a snakes head off I thought it was more than a little distasteful Richard Johnson makes a great villain and Claudio Cassinelli a likable hero The fishmen themselves look a little fake when the camera lingers on them too long but their cool looking and Ive seen worse Some of the miniature effects look a little poor too but overall again Ive again seen a lot worse Theres no real gore violence or nudity in it but that didnt really bother me actually The photography by Giancarlo Ferrando and the production design by Massimo Antonello Geleng combine to create a very nice looking film Period costumes props and sets like Rackhams house and Ernests lab with its old scientific equipment The lush green jungle settings also add to the visual splendour on show I really liked this film and I was entertained throughout its running time Im not sure who Id recommend it too as it mixes various genres I guess someone who maybe fancies something a little bit different and generally well made If you can find a copy give it a go Im glad I did
1,This is an exceptional picture with so much to recommend it The acting and writing are terrific and there are lots of great twists and turns in the plot As a French Noir film its language is certainly a lot earthier than its American counterparts but to me this just added to the realism Additionally I liked how nonglamorous everyone wasparticularly the husband and the lieutenant About the only negative and the reason the film gets a 9 and not a 10 is because there was a glaring plot hole Like another famous French film Drôle de Drame the confusion between the cops and the accused could easily have been settled in the beginning but the characters made rather stupid decisions For this you just need to suspend disbelief and keep watchingthe payoff is well worth the wait This is simply one of the finest French films I have seen Period
1,A stunning film which brought into the open so much about disability that generally makes people afraid It showed how minds can be captured by less than willing bodies and how difficult it must be to witness things happening to others that are wanted for the disabled individual Love friendship fear frustration joy humour and so many others things were so well captured The 2 lead characters were very well played by the 2 able bodied actors and invited your laughter tears concern joy and dismay I approached this film with a mixture of interest and trepidation worrying that it might be too much a play for sympathy or dwell only on negatives It was however a beautifully crafted story of 2 friends I loved it
1,It is difficult today and in the US to understand this movie We have nothing really to compare it with Here is an attempt at comparison It is as if during the last years of Saddams rule a filmmaker in Iraq were somehow able to make a film which for the first time ever showed life as it really was lived in that country The life of ordinary young girl with all the terror and the repression full blown Then the film was exhibited freely in Iraq If you could imagine that unlikely event then you might have an idea of what went on with this film in the last few years of the Soviet Union Prior to this film Soviet cinema was highly censored Soviet movies would only show an ideal life in the workers paradise Then suddenly this The alcoholism the random sex the ugly wasteland that was the Soviet city the choking pollution the proletariat victimizing each other and themselves the utter hopelessness  it is all there People were stunned Soviet women would often weep during the showings Many would say that this is the story of their lives It was a cultural earthquake the like of which filmmakers only dream of accomplishing It undoubtedly hastened the breakup of the Soviet Union  Reading the reviews here I can see that few understand this film One says it was groundbreaking because it contained real sex To the Soviet viewers at the time the sex was a minor event compared to fact that it portrayed reality for the first time in Soviet cinema  Others compare it to current films such as As Good as it Gets Might as well compare Homers Illiad to the latest John Grissam novel They simply do not compare This is not just a film this is was a social document and a transforming social force It needs to be viewed that way or you will not understand the film  Other reviewers see it as a film about a dysfunctional Russian family One even says that it is difficult to feel sorry for Vera because she keeps coming back to her family The point is that Vera and her family are symbols for all of Soviet life There was nowhere else to go because the family down the block and in the next town were the same This was life in the Soviet Union for most people  This is a film that can be viewed on many levels as a drama it traces the landscape of despair as a social document it shows the living conditions of the time as a political document it shows the attitude of the people and many of the reasons for the breakup of the Soviet Union and as a moral document it shows the evils of a dictatorship that is out of control and the cruelties that victims will practice on each other  Little Vera clearly shows the human toll that Socialism eventually takes on its victims despite any good intentions that system may have In doing so it helped end the Soviet regime thus contributing to one of the major changes in modern history This film achieves what only a few films have ever accomplished It is not only an stunning representation of history but it also become a force in that shaped history
1,During the making of this movie I once caught a statement on television about it Something like Is Killinggänget now taking off Nazism So my comprehension of this movie was from the beginning to get a notion of Nazism When recently seeing this movie in the TVversion I had this filter before me and it wasnt difficult to see this Strangely enough I havent met this way of interpreting the film ever since I first heard it These are the things I found in Four shades of brown In all four of the stories the lack of empathy leads to disaster 1 The crematoryworker shows no realistic empathy to the dead animals or to those who had to say goodbye to them In the crematoryroom in dealing with death and fire its almost like a cheerful game to him The seriousness of death and fire is not emphasized by the father and his boy accordingly in ignorance pushes a button that leads to the disaster that injures his father severely Possible lesson The importance of showing the young adequate emotions When they grow up they need to know what behavior leads to disaster and what emotions lead to good 2The magician maneuvers his wife like an invisible puppeteer Just when she thinks she has begun to cut off the strings to the masters hand reaching for personality integrity and joy he pulls hard and she is back in desolation and despair Their son has tried to revolt in creating his own life with perfection and good taste in opposite to his parents bad taste The real problem he is carrying within is far from comprehensible to him His fathers behavior passes on when suffocating his own wife in his spotless environment Possible lesson Oppression breeds bondage 3The father who was abused as a child passes on sadism to his children when he cheats them on their inheritance He robs them of their childhood and in the end even of their inheritance Possible lesson When no love given you cannot give any 4The fathers abuse of his daughter creates in her a ruthless revenger with sadistic aggression Here the ice cold Nazisadism becomes very obvious in physical violence It gives a possible background and a somewhat plausible explanation to the actions of young scinheadnazists behavior when oppressing others  Possible lesson  Can Nazism take birth in a pervert home Can the hideous consequence of ignoring empathy in family life in the long run be that room is given to sadistic Nazism  Very seldom does a movie contains so much It reveals little by little as I meditate on it I consider it brilliantly painted and the actors are superb Especially the niceseeming bloke played by Ulf Brunnberg that turns out to be the worst of all
1,Try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and youll be hardpressed HEAD is a masterpiece of nonlinear nonstructure surrealism and experimentaion In less than 90 minutes it manages to be not only a timecapsule of an era but also a fulllength experimental feature that defies timespace and convention in a way that only underground films of the sixties couldHEAD is a reflection of those films No matter how one feels about the Monkees this is a film every filmmaker should see because it cracks wide open the endless possibilities of film as an art medium Had it not been for the films unorthodox ad campaign and the fact that by the time it came out the Monkees so oversaturated the media that the public had become weary of them and every critic was ready to pounce on them this could have had a much greater impact Studying how the film was edited is much more important and exciting than whats actually in the film and yet there are some great things in it great songs great cinematography etc  Should be seen after midnight for maximum effect because of its overall dreamlike feel 1968 was a time of social unrest and a call for change thus the films working title Changes and HEAD perfectly mirrors that time
1,1st watched 8262001  8 out of 10 DirJohn Cassavetes Welldone early independent film by Cassavetes introduced a style that was much different than what Hollywood shows its audience This movie also introduced some very taboo subjects especially the actual racism that probably was prevalent all over the country but was not displayed by the mostly white controlled filmmakers of the time About the only black actors that had much respect at this time were the ones that acted and displayed personality like whitesaka Sidney Poitier Besides this the idea of ending a film without truly concluding the relationships that began leaves many moviegoers dumbfounded but actually makes the viewers realize that life is like thisit goes on I prefer this kind of an ending because it makes you think more about the characters and what may happen next and the conclusions are not just laid out for you The movie follows the lives of peopleparticulary a couple of people who have a brief relationship and happen to be opposite skin colors then we watch what happens when the white man realizes what hes done This is done very well and makes the movie very special The acting is supposedly done improvisationally which makes the movie even more amazing I guess you can say I liked this movie if you cant tell If you can find it check out this classic early independent film
1,One reasons why they call the 80s The Awesome 80s is quality television Shows like the Wonder Years War of the Worlds the series V Amazing Stories and many more have always left an impression to each fortunate one of us that in time will always find a way to reawaken itself To top that here comes Monsters A series quite unique of its own and a theme fully dedicate to  monsters May it be the good the bad and the morbid If youre a fan of classic shows or if you have the fascination of horror films then this one is absolutely for you Provided you can find this rare gem  Even the newer generations will be in awe with some of the episode with its grittiness its indiscriminating use of gore effects or its story telling power and simplicity I guarantee because Im 23  Be sure NOT to miss this Although its a show seemingly forgotten by the modern world it will always be with those who can always remember
1,I found West Point to be an agreeable film although I doubt that I would watch it again The performances were convincing with William Haines as yet another obnoxiously amusing young man that has his comeuppance by films end Its hard to believe that stardom beckoned Joan Crawford less than a year after this film was made as she looks rather awkward at times  I would apply the comment made by another concerning Ramon Novarros Huddle 1932 to this film as well There is a great film waiting to be made here but there is something lacking The backdrop and integration of the Corps was well utilized but I was less involved than I thought that I would be Perhaps Haines character went too far or got away with too much His repentance did not seem genuine enough and what kind of message did it send for him to run every play in the last minutes of the ArmyNavy game Wheres the Corps in that Might as well have taken out the other ten men and let him do it all himself Also I doubt very much that William Bakewells weak puny character would ever have a reallife counterpart at West Point All this aside the film is sometimes very moving and inspiring It is a fine look into the daily practices of an honorable institution Thank goodness that tradition still means something at West Point too unlike the vapid traditions of Ivy League schools only halfheartedly engaged in these days As to the score it was appropriately martial But there was a distinct overuse of snare drums Using them for knocks on the door scene transitions et ALU as well as in well over half the scenes got to be rather tedious It rather lessened the viewing experience I was ready to say I GET THE POINT ALREADY  With that enjoy the film but dont expect too much emotional involvement
1,Isabelle Huppert portrays a talented female piano teacher who is staid unfriendly and distant in public and bitter towards her students Privately she seethes with violence and frustration and her sexual life is solitary and perverse She lives with her overbearing mother who obsessively drives her to become noticed and so advance in life as a talented pianist The key to the characters of both mother and daughter is obsession These characters cannot change their impulses anymore than a rabbit caught in headlights can avoid death The piano teacher meets a young attractive talented pianist who from the beginning is attracted to her They start a relationship in the most unconventional way but from the outset she makes perverse and violent terms that he must perform on her which sickens him enough to want to terminate the relationship before it has really begun The film ties itself to the female lead Isabelle Huppert amazes with a brutal completely convincing performance as the piano teacher She cleverly shows a woman who is drawn to beauty and perversion but her violence is fed by her perverted impulses As a film that is so character driven you know it would not work half as well had she acted poorly This is powerful intelligently acted and intelligently and sensitively adapted from the novel The camera work also suits the film There are what I can only think to call framing shots where the director holds a scene and forces the eye to dart about This is done extremely effectively against a blank bathroom wall and is a further testament to the directors mastery Expect to be disturbed and sickened by this film But be brave  have the guts to go and see it This is a very private look into essentially one persons life but do not expect to be entertained in the Hollywood sensethere are no car chases in this film
1,I have seen this movie and anybody who has every been with the Marines or any branch of the service can appreciate the accuracy of this movie It is a must have for any collection Jack Webb does an excellent job as the hard drill instructor My father went to Marine boot camp at Camp Penelton and says this movie is so accurate that he feels like he is back in basic training There is a line in the movie where Jack Webbs character gets mad at a boot for killing a sand flea Well let me tel you there are nothing but sand fleas at the camp I have been there and can appreciate it As a matter of fact the exit to the camp is Las Puljas which in English means city of the fleas you must watch the movie to appreciate what I am saying Anybody who is into WWII movies all the battles start right here with the drill Sgt A must have for you collection
1,Crackerjack is a simple but feelgood movie where the good guys are very good and the bad guys are very bad and the central character is tempted by both sides The combination of the central character being played by Mick Malloy and the central setting being the local lawn bowls clubs drew an unusually broad crowd ranging from large numbers of teenagers to large numbers of senior citizens  and all laughed at the comedy As would be expected of a movie with Mick Malloy and Judith Lucy there was quite a bit of swearing but it was not overdone and the audience I sat with certainly enjoyed it Mick Malloy did a good job as the lazy bloke who joined the bowls club three times simply to get parking spaces one for himself and two for leasing to others at a premium but who has everything fall down on him when he is required to play or lose his membership Judith Lucy does a fine job as his local journalistloveinterest and there are fabulous performances from Bill Hunter Frank Wilson Monica Maughan Lois Ramsey and many others John Clarkes dour role as the bad guy is not one of his funniest but he gives a solid performance The not so subtle swipes at pokies provide a bit of a serious note to this otherwise light comedy Im sure that those who enjoyed The Castle and The Dish would also enjoy this movie
1,I saw this minimovie when it first aired and loved itIt kinda funny to see how far people will go for moneyIts also funny to see how much a boyfriend can be Whipped Whipped enough to kill I think the cast was great especially the character KristinWithout Her smooth talkingand deceptive looks the movie would have not been the same I never use to watch USA but now it is one of my stations 
1,Although many audio recordings of great musicians like Jascha Heifetz survive the cinematic or televised record is limited indeed This is why musical offerings like They Shall Have Music are such rare gems While with modern eyes and ears one can quibble about the plot the perceptive viewer should put this films unique delights in their proper perspective The plot was designed to appeal to both young and old audiences of the era but it remains enjoyable to this day A important aspect of the experience of watching classic films is to see them through the eyes of the moviegoer of that era I must take issue with reviewer who complains about a film that is in black and white or who feel obliged to report that their students express such reservations These are juvenile complaints which reflect a limited historical perspective For the teacher this should offer up an educational opportunity to explain the unique qualities of black and white photography and its place in cinematic history Color can in fact get in the way of a good storyline or the music For example the black and white photography of John Fords Stagecoach is like the still photographs of Ansel Adams an artistic masterpiece As for Heifetz being wooden I could not disagree more If you want blatant emotional posturing go to a rock concert The role of a classical musician like Heifetz is to move the audience not him or herself Heifetzs emotion is conveyed through his playing not through his body language He had a rare ability to extract every emotional nuance out of the music and transfer it to his listeners It is the listener who should be moved not the artist Incidentally one reviewer asked about seeing Heifetz on YouTube playing the 1st movement of the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto with Frank McHugh in the audience This is from the 1947 film Carnegie Hall not They Shall Have Music Carnegie Hall is an even greater treasure of many great classical artists in their prime We are blessed that there were film producers who at least in these limited instances chose to showcase these artists In was still an era not totally overwhelmed by the lowest common denominator tripe we get today
1,Greetings again from the darkness Director Alejandro Amenabar creates life against all odds in this based on a true story version of one mans struggle to control his destiny The great Javier Bardem is fascinating to watch in his role as Ramon His eyes and head movements leave little doubt what is going on in his mind The dream and fantasy sequences are not overused so prove very effective in explaining why he wants what he wants Rather than force us to answer the euthanasia question the real question posed is  What is Love At every turn we see people in love looking for love or dying to be loved The script is tight and keeps the film moving despite being filmed mostly in one room The supporting cast is wonderful and we truly feel their pain and how each family member deals with Ramons decision This is a gem and deserves to be seen
1,And I do not understand why the show gets so much beating In my opinion this show really is excellent Well the first two episodes were not that great but it picks up a load of momentum at the third episode Which seems to be typical for a Steve Moffat sitcom I would rate it among the best sitcoms Britain has ever produced The show itself is a farce at its best it is not along the lines of Fawlty Towers but you definitely can rank it as high as a Black Adder Coupling or The Young Ones I am watching the first season and all I can say is that I am happy I bought the DVD The problem probably with this show is and why it got smacked so hard according to the internet that the original press release compared it to Fawlty Towers and everyone was disappointed it was not Well even Green Wing is closer to Fawlty Towers than this show all I can say is clear your mind from every prejudice give the show at least a run until including episode 3 and then decide for yourself All I can say is thanks Steve Moffat for writing it and thanks for the entire staff pulling it off
1,I have been getting into the Hitchcock series very much lately I find myself always renting one of his movies when Im at Blockbuster or Hollywood Video Like I said before Hollywood is loosing its touch incredibly I needed a reminder that there are terrific films out there Not to mention I want to be a film appreciator not a movie buff Is there any better way to do that than with Alfred Hitchcocks movies  The Man who knew too Much is another great and exciting thriller starring Alfreds favorite leading man James Stuart and the woman who steals the show Dorris Day They play husband and wife who go on vacation with their son but when a spy tells James some information that could arrest another spy his son is kidnapped and held for ransom James seems to just doubt Dorris and her ability for ideas on how to get their son back but she makes a great comeback and just about ends up being the hero of the flick The acting again I would say that Dorris was the one who outshined the whole cast James did a great job keeping up together these two made you sit down and never budge throughout the film I loved the little bit of comedy at the end that Alfred added Youll see what I mean I would always highly recommend this film despite not being the best Hitchcock film its still a treasure 910
1,Seems like MHazanavicius is backThe man behind la classe américaine comes back with a really fun and clever sequel to those oldfashioned OSS117Whereas directors tend to overactualize sequels of old classics remember the avengersurk Hazanavicius chose to work on a really cheap hero OSS117 a kind of lowbudget french 007 and decides to do it in a oldschool wayThe photography the body attitudes the fights choreography and the FX everything is like an homage to the way films were made back in the 50sAnd it works as the tone and jokes of the movie are really good Jean Dujardin embodies perfectly this stupidarrogantmachoselfish french spy lost in a country he understands only in terms of folklore and inferiorityYes thats it just the way the occident uses to consider its colonies back then and oh no I wont say it has anything to do with what happens nowadays in the very same areaah ahHe just looks like an unfrozen Lino Ventura with something like 40 pounds less which is perfect for the roleThe other members of the cast fit perfectly as well with all you can dream of Russian spies Egyptian independantists and former NazisAnd of course the women as there has to be femmes fatales in any good spymovies The plot is good maybe not brilliant but really good enough taking place between actual historical facts and remembering us in a funny way how France and the others treated its colonies back in those days It all starts in 1955 with a British spy disappearing while tracking a Russian cargo full of weapons in SuezThen France sends his best friend agent OSS117 to discover what happened to both the shipment and the agent The fact is that this agent is really as dumb as can be and he slips through the story without even understanding it solving it in a very clouseauesquire way I have to say I had a bad feeling about the movie as the publicity made around it was quite frightening and as french humor tends to be quite populist and flat forget about les bronzés 3 or camping but I was really surprised and in the good way I highly recommend it whether you want a good parody of Bondesquire movies much more fun than in DEBS for example but less skirts or youre a fan of that genuine and candid way of filming they had back in the 5Os Yes thats it clever and really funny youve got the point once again Mr Hazanavicius
1,This film hits the heart with a reality like no other I have seen It shows what us what we in a democratic society take for granted and just what we are lucky enough not to be experiencing The acting in the film is superb sometimes you have to remind yourself that the movie is a dramatization and not real life Mr Rickman does wonders with his role as he does with all roles making the interrogator fully dimensional and human The set is incredible It gives the feeling of in the round theater Which does not add or take away from the emotion of the action This movie seeks to open the eyes of the viewer and Id say they have made a success of that goal
1,This is a great movie Too bad it is not available on home video
1,I saw this film at the Rotterdam International Film Festival 2002 This seemed to be one of the less popular films on the festival however as it turned out all the more interesting The story of an actor trying to come to grips with himself and his environment after withdrawing from a drug addiction is based on actual facts Moreover the characters playing in the film are the real people living this experience over again this time for the film which is partly set up as a stage play Not only do they all happen to be good actors Jia Hongshengs parents are actors in real life as well the methods used in highlighting their relationship towards Jia are very effective Jia Hongsheng is the actor of some Chinese action films late eighties start nineties Later you can see him in great films such as Frozen and Suzhou River In between these two career paths Jia becomes a drug addict and looses all drive to act or even do anything productive except for making somewhat futile attempts at becoming a guitar virtuoso I like the way the writer of the scenario choose to emphasize on his behavior after withdrawal more than on the horror of drugs We really feel the pain and struggle Jia is in At the same time we hate him for the way he treats those around him The film draws the viewer into a tiring pattern Jia seems to be caught in dragging with him his parents and sister who try to take care of him Because there are personal interviews with the characters we feel like we are getting to know Jia not only through himself but through others as well The film has a heavy feel but scenes of Jia cycling through Bejing and partying with his friends lighten the tone So does the bitter humor in a lot of events throughout the film The music is beautiful and stayed with me for a while after This is a film that might not easily appeal to many people but for those interested in the more serious and modern Chinese film this is a strong recommendation
1,People seem to be expecting Citizen Kane here The Planet is a Bmonster movie and as such is good fun and different enough to be enjoyed The director clearly has something to offer  not so sure about some of the cast As for the effects £8000 aint a lot of effects budgetI for one would happily recommend this outing to a scifi head or anyone who doesnt take monster movies too seriously If so Watch 3colours blue insteadI noticed one review saying it had ripped off Alien Like Alien didnt rip things off The best thing about the film The director The worst thing about the film The cast Maybe its time for the Director to move from Glasgow to London and find some talent In the meantime  well done At least youre trying to do something
1,First love Teenage love We all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the one the protagonists share Friends could be considered an adaptation of the classic The Blue Lagoon originally from 1949 and its remakes from 1980 the most popular one with Brooke Shields and 1999 with a young Milla Jovovich While The Blue Lagoon puts the two young lovers in a desert island with no contact with civilization Friends goes the opposite route and it is sure to ring much more true and be a more difficult movie with contemporary audiences Paul and Michelle who for different reasons turn their backs on family and the adult world to end up living together in a small cottage in Southern France Having only each other and their childhood innocence their friendship slowly develops into much more as they struggle to sustain themselves in this sweet coming of age story This film even to this day is controversial since the actors are teenagers and they certainly look the ages that are stated in the movie 15 and 14 12 The movie does contains a hint of child molesting nudity depictions of teenage sex and teenage pregnancy But the real controversy is not the subject matter but the fact that Paul and Michelles love is presented as a natural and healthy relationship While this worked fine for stranded lovers in another time and in a desert island having them in a modern setting presents some very difficult moral issues Laws prohibiting consenting sex between minors are in effect in almost all countries and lack of sexual education in teenagers is seen as one of the causes for the rise in unwanted teenage pregnancies and abortions Is a movie like this one just child pornography or a slap in the face to make us face our own hypocrisy regarding a modern society that does not cater to teenage parents and laws that clearly go against human nature and hormonal development but that are needed to prevent child abuse Is hormonal development parallel to emotional growth These are not easy questions and most of us will feel uncomfortable with them As an artistic piece this movie is really a forgotten and rough gem The script progresses with extreme simplicity albeit some sappiness but never pulling any punches to state its message although by today standards it is somewhat slow The photography is beautiful and it has scenes of great beauty The acting of the two protagonists varies from really awful in some scenes to marvelously innocent and credible in others Pop music unlike most productions nowadays is used tastefully and sometimes the lyrics speak the thoughts of the protagonists Overall this is a delightful piece even if the moral values are not in concordance with your own
1,Most people are totally unaware that this movie exists Fox which paid Judge to make it has kept it in the can for quite awhile and then spent nothing to promote it I guess that made many people think it was one of the garbage movies being flushed in late summer Well I am here to tell you that this is a funny and rather frightening look at a future that is not that hard to believe Basically Judge puts forward the notion that the stupid are outbreeding the smart by a wide margin Then these stupid are getting more stupid by basically spending all of their time watching TV and having sex which produces more stupid people By 2500 a person of average intelligence today will appear to be a genius that talks all faggy Seriously is this really that hard to believe Oh sure this future is painfully funny and ridiculously stupid but still plausible Luke Wilson is great as the time traveling army guy hopelessly trying to get back to a more comfortable time Where this story will gain its cult status is with the numerous funny oneliners like can we family style her and hey man Im bating here This is a funny movie and a rather sharp social commentary on an American society that seems to be fatuated with self pleasure comfort and stupidity and I guarantee you that I will be buying this on DVD the first day it comes out and watching it over and over
1,As I have said before I am NOT a fan of Tweety Hes just so aggravating I wish Sylvester would just eat him and get it over with In this cartoon Sly is homeless once again and is back to feeding out of garbage cans He spots a cruise ship leaving port nearby and decides to hop aboard when he spys Tweety is one of the passengers  The ship provides an adequate stage for the following hijinks and Sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid seasickness If only for once hes succeed by chewing and swallowing thus finishing of the irritating Canary forever But as cartoons starring Tweety go this one is quite good but its ALL thanks to that brilliant cat
1,Written by brilliant Monkees TV writers Gerald Gardner and Dee CarusoWHICH WAY TO THE FRONT was the last of the Jerry Lewis movies until Hardly Working almost a decade later Jerrys comedy is evidently an acquired taste and admittedly he can occasionally be his own worst enemy when he helms as producerdirectorbut even in the dreariest of his films there are always moments of brilliance WHICH WAY manages to be amusingentertaining and yesquite funny It is somewhat unlike any of the typical Lewis filmsThe pace is very upbeat and ther are lots of excellent supporting playersa kind of JERRY DOES HOGANS HEROESThe whole thing looks kind of like an unsold TV pilot and you will either love it or hate itbut hopefully YOU VILL LAUGH
1,This scifi great fortunately has little to do with the first one Elias KoteasJack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets nakedBilly Drago appears in this and is cool as usual  a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget
1,Every high praise word fell way short before the height of this movie This movie is the true example of how a psychological horror movie should be The plot seems to be a bit confusing at first viewing but it will definitely explain a bit about whats going on and you really want to view it for the second time But after second viewing you will start to join the pieces together and then you will know how amazing a movie can be A word of advice for slasher flick fans stay away from this movie This is not your dumb ass teenage slasher movie in which you just switch off your brain and sit in front of the screen just to see big bbs and lots of blood If you want to heighten the psychological horror factor of this movie then watch it all alone with a great home theater system that supports Dolby Digital or DTS 51ch without any of your ill mannered friends that crack jokes on a really tense situation And dont forget to switch the light off My points on different aspects Direction  910 Acting  810 Atmosphere  1010 Sound Effect  910 Total  910
1,Even for scifi this movie is movie is a little out there Alright more than a little My first thought after watching it was that i had just lost my mind Dont watch this movie expecting another Darko Darko fans are never going to like another Richard Kelly movie because of their freaky cult standards Donnie Darko is a thing of the past get over it Richard Kelly loves making movies that make you feel stupid for not understanding the Deeper meaning the first time you watch them To be honest I had to watch The Box twice before I liked it  The deeper meaning to spare you a bunch of sociological psycho babble Humans are self serving we make decisions that can destroy our lives and dont open mail without a return address Summary Creepy old man tells Cammeron Diaz if you push the button i will kill someone you dont know and give you a million bucks Of course she pushes it and as promised by the creepy old gets a case of money Then the movie takes a dive into the unusual To spare my fingers the typing For pushing the button Diaz and her husband are cursed by supernatural alien beings in an elaborate experiment to gage the morality of the human race I liked The willingness of the movie to ignore the generic movie guidelines Its different Its intense It has a deeper meaning although its philosophy 101 material It leaves you guessing NOT A Hollywood ENDING I disliked Why would any being with the technology to inhibit another life form devise such a ridiculous scheme What god like alien has the patience for that Diaz was good but was there a need for the country accent They live in Virginia  I give it a 7 because Kelly didnt put as much attention to detail as with his other movies Overall good flick
1,Scientist Carl Lehman well played by David McIlwraith gets blown up something terrible in a deliberate chemical explosion He has his brain transplanted in the body of a nearly indestructible metal cyborg suit by his evil colleagues who are led by wicked obsessive fellow scientist Alex Whyte a perfectly hateful portrayal by Richard Cox Lehman embarks on an allout killing spree Its up to nasty mercenary Hunter a wonderfully loathsome turn by the divine Pam Grier to put a stop to him Director JeanClaude Lord who previously helmed the underappreciated slasher psycho thriller Visiting Hours stages the plentiful action scenes with considerable verve and maintains a zippy pace throughout thus ensuring that this flick sizes up as an enjoyably trashy scifihorror action outing Paunchy character thesp Maury Chaykin easily cops top acting honors as disgusting fat creep Burt who in the movies single most tasteless sequence has a brutal fistfight with Lehmans pregnant wife Lauren a winning performance by the lovely Teri Austin Stan Winstons nifty makeup fx and Paul Zazas thrilling score further add to the overall sleazy fun
1,Do not expect a classic military comedy which claims to make fun of the military while only enhancing a militaristic outlook Instead it deconstructs the elements that make the military such a murderous machine Kind of East German version of Buffalo Soldiers NVA works on a metalevel that it sympathizes with its heroes attempts to escape from army drill any which way they can Its not about loud laughs but about long lasting smiles Utopian of course in one scene you will be shown the harsh reality but very thoughtful Just to fill the required 10 lines Do not go into that movie if you have been an army officer and liked your job
1,Cuba Gooding Jr is back on top Jesus he did a great job in this film I LOVED this movie Its one of those feel good movies that makes you want to run out and volunteer at a mission or something Anyway I would recommend seeing this movie in a heartbeat Well worth the price of admission And as for Cuba Gooding Jr just give him his next Oscar right now
1,Look this movie is obscure brilliant and a classic that should sought out by any means necessary I suppose the powers that be have decided that it will forever be relegated towards the bargin bin nevertheless we could only pray for the chance to see this one on DVD I would say that it even beats the great Phatasm If you like a dark movie with plenty of spooky imagery look for this one and see how an 80s horror movie is suppose to be
1,If it were possible to award a 10  this would be the one film I would choose I remember catching this film on TV many many years ago  and fortunately being prepared enough to video it Now my video copy is getting old video technology is outdated and Im starting to worry that I may not be able to enjoy the delights of this movie for much longer As a wildlife film it is superb As a film about the relationship between man and nature it surpasses anything screened before or since How can the film industry allow such a classic to go unnoticed and forgotten If such a thing as a lobbypressure group exists to push for the rerelease of this film count me in and send me the details pronto My guess is theres a mint to be made by anyone able to rerelease this in todays market
1,I was hugely impressed with this movie if for nothing else than for the comedy It might not be the edgiest wittiest humor at all times but I found it appropriate to every scene The flow of the film is certainly a bit jumbled almost confusing sometimes but that is how the characters feel Sometimes were watching a bit of slapstick and other scenes revolve around a decisive discourse on relationships This might be a bit frustrating to certain viewers but it brought me closer to the characters dilemmas of irregular chaos The acting is great from everyone Im a huge Andy Richter fan but I wasnt head over heels for his part like everyone else seems to be He did very well but Julianne Nicholson and Lauren Graham stole the show for me both in their respective ways Jay Mohr performs as expected if youve seen him in other films Ive always liked him Overall the movie is very funny and offers some nice foundations for a few types of relationships When it comes to relationship questions and problems some films try to surprise Theres nothing surprising about the conclusions offered here but its entertaining to watch them be revealed throughout the film
1,I put this movie on not expecting much other than a B movie gore fest Thankfully I was presented with a very well made film that built up the suspense and managed to maintain it throughout its run time This was an impressive achievement The acting was solid creating characters that you cared about and related to and although some may find the film slow it did force you to think about what you would have done in the same situation Added to this there was some fine camera work and the directors pulled it all together admirably An excellent effort then that is well worth your time if you prefer development and suspense over gore
1,What some mistake for stilted dialog andor dismiss as archetypal characterizations accurately represents how people talked lived and were before World War II let alone in whatever years The Big Trail represent on film The movie took my breath away the first time I saw it years ago Reading the boards here helped me understand why it missed at the box office and why movie goers got the benefit of Wayne in B Westerns for another ten years Wayne was in my opinion better in The Big Trail and the years of Bs than most of his star turns after 1939 with Fords incredible cavalry trilogy True Grit and The Shootist being Big time exceptions What a shame theaters missed the boat on this in 1930 Had this movie hit we might have enjoyed more movies with more realism and less hokum In my opinion this is not only one of the finest westerns ever filmed with accurate dialog and accurate character realization but among the finest representations of a passage of any kind ever put on film It still takes my breath away Especially the dialog and accurate characterizations of types that simply dont exist any more Some celebrate the surface homogenization of our culture that in fact hides the largest cultural degradation into people like us and people like them and political divide corporatists vs Main Streetists in US history but for me The Big Trail represents a time when our surface differences were more obvious but underneath them most folks wanted to work out the nations failures and most folks aspired to build a great culture and a great nation The Big Trail is an epic of the melting pot in motion toward the American Dream Certainly the finest film on that path I ever saw that subject ever filmed
1,TV News producer Jane Craig Hunter meets Tom Grunick Hurt an upandcoming news presenter at a seminar and their mutual attraction takes them back to her room Romance however is cut short when it emerges that Tom is in his own words no good at what Im being a success at and Jane realises he personifies everything she hates about where TV news is going The rub comes when Tom reveals he is about to join her news bureau in Washington Jane and Toms initial attraction is therefore given a second chance but will Jane be able to put aside her professional opinion of the man she finds herself attracted to  and should she Aaron Altman Brooks is Janes highly intelligent reporter colleague and confidante Despite his obvious talent Aarons career is stalling as he lacks the confidence and people skills  and the classic good looks  to be the success that his new less qualified and less intelligent colleague  Tom  is becoming He is also concerned that his good friend Jane maybe falling in love with Tom despite her better judgement as it becomes increasingly clear that Aaron has his own romantic feelings for her This central romantic plot is set within the trials and tribulations of a TV news network office where moral dilemmas and ethics are wrestled with quickly and where appearances and dramatic effect are becoming more prevalent and important This is where most of the bite comes from with wellobserved comment and scenes One of many moments is a scene where Tom meets the Networks top anchorman Bill Rorich a cameo role for Jack Nicholson for the first time and the camera focuses on their handshake In a film full of great lines and dialogue long and short you realise a lot about these two mens character from this one quick shot of two hands The dialogue between characters is amongst the most intelligent and witty you are ever likely to find anywhere on film and in such abundance Brooks gets the best portion of them in line with his character but even the briefest conversations that are incidental and perhaps overheard by one or more of the characters as they move through a crowded room should be listened to Hunter is a tourdeforce in this role for which she was rightly and not alone nominated for an Oscar and for which she probably would have got if it was for a role in a film that didnt mock part of what had become a closely related industry  and against a strong performance from another actress in a more traditional feelgood romcom Brooks is also excellent as the constantly frustrated and occasionally toosmugforhisowngood Aaron Altman Hurt whilst possessing the looks and providing the personality required of his character does not always convince that he is quite as dimwitted the character says he is or is supposed to be He displays a latent intelligence that enables him to make the most of his apparent limitations which may be plausible but I dont think Hurt quite pulls it off Apart from when he tells us he stinks or doesnt get it Hurt comes across as a bit smarter than that Otherwise it is an effective performance in a role where his character is compromised by its intellectual limitations but Brooks and Hunter slightly overshadow Hurts performance It is the only negative thing I can say about the whole film and who is to say that anyone else would have done it better or come off any better when next to Hunter and Brooks and their performances in this movie Support is ably provided by amongst others Robert Prosky Lois Chiles and Joan Cusack and there is also a bitpart role for Christian Clemenson of subsequent Boston Legal fame and the briefest of bitparts for Joans brother John Cusack whose face you dont even see James L Brooks has provided us with many great TV shows and movies and this film should rank up there with the very best of them It may not have won any Oscars despite seven nominations but it did win plenty of other awards and turned Holly Hunter into a star
1,When I see a movie I usually seek entertainment But of course if I know what genre the move is then I will seek what it is meant to do For example if it is a deep film I expect the film to rile thoughts up in my cranium and make me ponder what it is saying But Whos That Girl is not a deep film But it is entertaining nonetheless Its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch Theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts Ive watched it when I was younger The cast is always entertaining as usual I had a small crush on Griffin Dunne even though he wasnt the typical male heartthrob at the time Haviland Morris also stars And late Austrian actress Bibi Besch is here too Overall a delight

1,Actor turned director Liev Schreiber The Sum of All Fears does an above average screen version of the novel Everything Is Illuminated by author Jonathan Safran Foer This tale of journey and self discovery is highlighted by strong ensemble performances and sharp direction with a storyline that enriches and enlightens the soul Jonathan Foer Elijah Wood is a young man who has seen his grandfather Safran pass away Jonathan has a peculiar habit of taking small objects and lifes little memorabilia and sealing them in plastic ziplock bags to display them on his wall Safran gives Jonathan an old picture showing a young Safran standing next to a beautiful girl who saved his life many years ago Thus Jonathan commences on a long journey to locate this mystery woman in the Ukraine not knowing if she is still alive He enlists the help of a brash young tour guide named Alex Eugene Hutz and his grandfather Boris Leskin to drive him to his goal At first the trip hits dead ends and false leads but as the group nears its target the men find themselves amid the ruins of a dark chapter in history with the memories of war and the past ghosts of a nonexistent town There they find their own respective destinies and will be forever changed by what they learn This film feels like it was directed by someone who knew how to get the most from his actors At times the film is spoken in Russian and seems like a foreign film The title itself is a play on self discovery This is a thoughtful trek of one man into his past and his past ironically involves his companions Jonathans obsessive journey becomes an emotional journey for Alex and his grandfather as well Its a tale of bonding over the long haul and the guilt one must carry for a lifetime By the end of the film these characters have all experienced life altering events that will permanently intertwine their lives It proves that memories can be powerful in traumatizing and also cleansing the soul Its also about ones legacy and how others view an event or a person in the past Alex eventually sees his grandfather in a completely different light Even our perception of these individuals will have changed by films end which is a tribute to a story that is well told The story is deceptively simple It functions as a road trip movie like The Straight Story combined with an interesting mystery story It really involves a great many layers of emotions and subplots that range from the past to the present The ending is a bit surreal with its déjà vu feeling Elijah Wood Sin City The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has chosen a wide range of roles ever since his splash in The Lord of the Rings trilogy Here he does a fine job with what is essentially a minimalist role with not much to show Eugene Hutz and Boris Leskin fare better as Alex and his grandfather respectively Even the grandfathers dog named Sammy Davis Jr Jr thats right is funny as a fiercely loyal companion The spare music score by Paul Cantelon is a moody compliment to the thoughtful nature of the film The editing is effective as imagery from past and present are linked and transitioned effortlessly The cinematography by Matthew Libatique Gothika Requiem for a Dream is appropriately stark and lifeless with some impressive images of war and its aftermath The coincidences that emerge during the last half of the film make for good drama but are a little too coincidental We never fully understand the whole background story of Alexs grandfather and what his motivations are Likewise Jonathans blank stares and lack of apparent substance and depth do not give us much more than a sketch of a quirky man At times the film feels a little downbeat and depressing as more horrific revelations are exposed But these are minor criticisms of what is a good introspective story with good performances and interesting themes of remembrance and closure That Schreiber not only directed but adapted the screenplay to this worthwhile slice of history is a tribute to his talents and promising potential in the future
1,This is a nicelydone story with pretty music lots of dancing lots of big sisterlittle sister interaction almost all of it positive and lots of wishes granted There are funny moments that older children and adults will enjoy such as when King Randolph exclaims Theyre just SHOES Arent they And tender moments such as when Princess Genevieve comforts her youngest sister Lacey after a blunder The animation is perhaps not as good as Disney but it still is very good The facial expressions are nuanced particularly for Genevieve King Randolph Duchess Rowena and her servant Derek the cobbler and little Princess Lacey My only quibble on the animation is in the dance sequences where the dancing princesses become absolute carbon copies of each other without the slightest deviation  even the three youngest copy the dance steps perfectly I would have liked to see a little more individualism in the dancing considering that these girls are not professional ballerinas or chorus dancers The resolution of the story is handled cleverly to get rid of a villainess without actually hurting her There is some violence done to guards in the story and the villainesss monkey is mean to other animals in the story My 4yearold daughter loves this movie and has watched it repeatedly and I have found it to be quite acceptable for her to watch
1,Not much to it but a validation of small town values and the embracing of a mentally challenged young man into its heart I read some of the reviews and was surprised at some of the hostility it engendered I felt Cuba Gooding handled the part with dignity and respect unlike Sean Penns drooling fool portrayal in I am Sam The fact that this is based on a true story makes it all the more heartwarming Sports are taken seriously in small town high school America and elsewhere I suspect and I felt the portrayal of these competitive students opening their hearts to one less fortunate rang true at least for me The coach was never forced to choose between his daughter and Radio but rather came gently to the decision himself under Radios loving and open ways Very well done to all 7 out of 10 Debra Winger we need more of you in pictures
1,This movie from what I remember was such a great movie I watched it on television when I was 11 and couldnt remember the title of it If I remember correctly I do believe that it was a Christmas television movie special One of my friends at work and I were discussing it several years back but neither one of us could remember the title But we did remember almost the entire movie No one else at work remembered ever seeing it Thank goodness someone at a TV movie website answered my post Now I have the fun job of locating a copy of it Its amazing what you can remember as a child but this movie definitely remains vividly playing in my head even after 28 years And I do believe I only watched it once Maybe it was because I am the oldest sister in my family or maybe because I babysat and worked in day care centers that it stuck with me that long Regardless of the real reason it has remained one of the movies that I have been really wanting to watch lately If anyone knows where to watch it online or has a copy please let me know I would so love to see it again Thanks so much Seriously I tried to post this and it says my comment isnt long enough So apparently I have to type more did you know that Melissa Michaelsen is the sister of Peter Billingsley who starred in A Christmas Story I know Im not the only fan of this movie so if anyone has any idea on where to find this I would greatly appreciate it
1,This is one of the best movies I have ever seen Its so full of details and every time you see it youll find new things Like then the father is in the shower but still only hears one voice and when the girls flute they cant do it at the same time cause then there would be two girls and there arent  I have some problem finding out about in the middle of the movie their Uncle visit them but why does his wife freak out Else a fantastic movie The best Asian movie ever I hope people will enjoy it There have been so many movie where the main character is skitso The machinist Secret Window and so on but this movie is way better than them
1,From the offset I knew this was going to be a terrific movie the pace the cinematography personalities indigenous to the Dallas area the diversification of characters not to mention the director Oliver Stone and of course Eric BogasianThe film starts out on a Friday suggestively occult in the first place and begins with a radio station in Dallas that is hosting their number one talk show The Barry Champlain Show Based on the Talk Radio Host Alan BergBarry Eric Bogasian is the abrasive radio talk show host and his job is such whereby it is compulsory to pontificate all of the sensationalistic nuances of the radio audience feeding into his showHe attempts to commiserate with a bunch of societal deviates turned lonely vulnerable obscene phone callers who have the masochistic craving to be publicly vilified Barry Champlain is effective in coping with this precarious ilk by socially debasing them rather than simply subjugating them to mere admonishmentNew technologies serve a stigmatic purpose for the Dallas radio audience and paramount concepts take a backseat to perversion talk about Baseball Scores Orgasms and Peoples Pets The whole thing is a cacophony of druginduced diatribes and a potpourri for psychopathic paranoia This high profile cannon fodder is something that Barry Champlain thrives on The convoluted pathos the deranged proclivities deeriving from inaneities and puveyors of pornography and the overall pop culture afflictions serve as volatile ammunition for Barry Champlains stilted battleground The setting for this movie is perfect in that there is a two thousand foot drop in terms of ideology In the the center of Dallas there is an overbearing sense of cosmopolitan awareness whereby 20 miles away resides a significant chapter of the Ku Klux KlanThe play is based in Denverthat is where the actual story takes place other small theater plays depict the cities of Louisville Atlanta and Cleveland Dallas is the city where the film takes place I thought it was an excellent choiceThis movie illustrates how people have a horrid and erroneous and deadly misconceptualization of the Jewish people in America whereby they control the banks their agenda is different than everybody elses and their intellectual literature leads to perversion These preconceived notions compound Barry Champlains overall dilemma Barry Champlains personal undoing is whereby he is irascible and nonresponsive to his alcoholism and his abrasive and politically controversial nature is his ultimate undoing this is what makes the film so believable The characters in the movie were well portrayed Dan the tailor made for middle management hatchet man played by Alec Baldwin who was constantly monitoring Barry Champlains every moveLaura his girlfriend also his producer will constantly feel Barry is someone who is always misunderstood Ellen his exwife is a recipient of Barrys anguish and selfishness but cannot quite relinquish her feelings for Barry regardless of the path of personal destruction he winds up resorting to The Dallas radio audience is a melting pot of socially misplaced retrobates who are dementedly amused by their own real shortcomingsIn part everybodys hangups including Barry Champlains own hangups are what do Barry Champlain in His audience ogles depravity solicits amelioration and ultimately becomes Barry Champlains pet project for prescribed sinners Social culture conflicts become Barry Champlains downfall  This movie is superb In my opinion Oliver Stones best picture including Platoon and Natural Born KillersThat statement in of itself tells you how magnificent a film Talk Radio isThe story consulting and acting and coproducing of Eric Bogosian is simply compelling The camera angles the dialogue the haunting character portrayals all top notchThe cinematography of the Dallas skyline at the end of the movie is terrific Dallas has the dubious distinction of being deemed a mega metropolisSo now just like Los Angeles and New York there are crack baby cases too numerous to count low cost housing neighborhoods from Hell and budgets cuts that will mean there will be a significant number of people who will be dead by this time next yearDallas asserts its status as a major metropolitan area in the precarious manner by which human debauchery prevails The city has its lynching radio listeners who have given a pejorative spin to the marvel of nationwide air wave communication These are the culprits in the movie The ghoulish tabloid derelicts who want to meet the big bad wolf and their decadent curiosity has morally obliterated The last neighborhood in America
1,I love the way he experiments Ab Tak Chappan was a thrill to watch just as much Satya and company was Jatin the new comer also lived up to his role and Nana Patekar was at his best Suchak was really irritating but I think he fit the character he was playing  he had really ugly teeth The story has a great progress and no songs in the movie makes it better I only wish he signs up Urmila for his other up coming movies I think they are the best director and actress combination I have seen I have not seen Naach as yet but I am looking forward for it I for some reason dont find Antra Maali that exciting to watch on the screen  unlike Urmila
1,So it isnt an epic but for people experiencing anything similar sibling suicide it might be an interesting way of therapy An imaginative narrative and some fine acting makes it time well spent For some reason it hasnt really caught on in the audience something I do believe is a result of the main theme Why did she commit suicide Clearly this is hardly something that US moviegoers will flock to had it been an European production it probably would have reached its audience in a much greater extent It is however a movie that although the realism tainted by a shimmering romanticized glow gives the viewer a whole hearted impression
1,Favela Rising is a documentary about the slums of Rio the favelas specifically the most violent one Vigário Geral According to this film a lot more kids have died violently in Rios favelas over the last decade or so than in IsraelPalestine during the same period  a fact astonishing if true which shows how underrecognized this social problem is in the rest of the world This is an important topic especially for those who see hope in grassroots efforts to marshal the neediest and most at risk through a vibrant cultural program This is a compelling documentary if occasionally marred by a somewhat too personalitybased version of events and by grainy digital video and film that sometimes may make you think you need to have your eyes examined Drug lords rule in the favelas and guntoting teenage boys are the main drug dealers like in parts of Colombia Fernando Meirelles movie City of GodCidade de Deus has been accused of celebrating violence Cidade de Deus is another of Rios many favelas But the early section of Favela Rising shows that in fact favela boys do celebrate violence and want to deal drugs where the money and the action are Its cool to carry a gun there cool to work as a drug trafficker its fifty times more profitable than the earnings available by other means Mochary first discovered the AfroReggae movement and its leaders Anderson Sá and José Junior while visiting Rio for a conference and quickly persuaded his friend and mentor Zimbalist to quit his job and come down to help make a film with his own promise to fund it Sás eloquence and charisma and a startling twist in his life make him the center of the film and its chief narrator but like the favelas themselves the film teems with other people No doubt about the fact that Sá is a remarkable leader organizer and artist Vigário Geral is compared to Bosnia shooting there was very dangerous Anderson Sás friendship and protection and caution and diplomacy in the shooting enabled the filmmakers to gain access and shoot detailed footage of their subject matters while mostly there were close calls avoiding any serious confrontations with drug lords or drugdealing cops They also trained boys to use cameras and left them there on trips home That resulted in 10 of the footage including rare shots of violent incidents including police beatings Its hard for an outsider to keep track of police massacres in Rio There was one in the early 1990s that looms over the story and inspired Sá who ended his own early involvement in drug trafficking to lead his cultural movement The cops are all over the drug trade and if anybody doesnt like that the ill trained police paramilitaries come in often wearing black ski masks and shoot up a neighborhood killing a lot of innocents This is pretty much the picture we get in Meirelles City of God except that this time Sá Junior and the other guys come in starting in Vigário Geral but spreading out eventually to a number of other favelas to give percussion classes that attract dozens of youth  girls as well as boys Their AfroReggae Grupo Cultural AfroReggae or GCAR program formed in 1993 is a new alternative way of life for young black men in the Rio ghettos It leads them to leave behind smoking alcohol and drugs thats the rule to explode into rap song percussion and gymnastics in expressive galvanic performances Eventually the best of the performers led by Sá wind up appearing before big local audiences with local producers and their Banda AfroReggae has an international recording contract Other centers and groups have been created by or through the GCAR over the years in Vigário Geral and other favelas to seek the betterment of youth by providing training and staging performances of music capoeira theater hiphop and dance at GCAR centers The performance arts arent everything just the focal point GCAR is also a movement for broader social change Gathering public awareness through such performances the centers also provide training in information newspaper radio Internet email links hygiene and sex education to seek to bridge gaps between rich and poor black and white and to offer workshops in audiovisual work including production of documentaries The program is currently active in four other favelas There are many scenes of favela street and home life in Favela Rising and they look very much like the images in City of God with the important difference that the focus and outcome are very very much more positive Not that it isnt an uphill battle And the corruption of the police the inequities of the social system and the indifference of the general population of Brazil are not directly addressed by any of this But theres a scene where Sá talks to some young kids in another favela cynical boys not enthusiastic about AfroReggae and determined to work in the drug trade as Sá himself did as a boy Sá doesnt seem to be convincing any of them despite pointing out that traffickers dont make it to the age of fifty But we learn that the most negative boy in this group Richard Morales joined the movement five months later Theres also the account of a freak accident that disabled Sá but with a positive outcome It would be great if the images were sharper and clearer and if the story were edited down a little but this is vibrant inspiring material and represents committed risktaking documentary filmmaking and its nice that Favela Rising has been included in seven film festivals and won a number of awards including Best New Documentary Filmmaker at the Tribeca Film Festival Its currently being shown at the Institute of Contemporary Arts ICA in London However a wide art house audience in the US seems somewhat unlikely Included in the SFIFF 2006
1,I quite this Anne Rice book adaption While most of the film is filmed here in Australia it offers a great amount of scenery and a fantastic area to shoot in Lestat Stuart Townsend has recently woke up from a long period time of sleep and has decided to betray his vampire oath by revealing himself to a band When he becomes a popular movie icon his fellow vampires understadebly go mad and plot his death Meanwhile Jesse Marguerite Moreau a orphaned member of the supernatural studies who has an ancient vampire family tree has become deeply obsessed with Lestat Her boss David Paul McGann understands her obsession and revaeals his obsession with the vampire Marius Vincent Perezwho is an ancient vampire and the man who made Lestat a vampire too Jesse is given Lestats diary and reads of his first killing and an encounter with the Queen of the Damned Akasha Aaliyah When Lestat holds a concert in Death Valley he receives news that not only will angry vampires be there Akasha may come as well Meanwhile Akasha has other plans She goes to a vampire coven a bar and kills everyone in her path With Lestat tempted with royality and loving care by Akasha the ancient vampires consisting of Marius and Jesses Aunt Maharet Lena Olin plot against them Join Her Or Die I thought the film was fantastic it had great fight scenes great music and great locations Aaliyah sadly passed away in a plane crash shortly before the films premiere but she looked stunning on the set and off the sets I gave this film 1010 because it was a fantastic film and I urge you to see it
1,James Franco is totally cool in this movie Not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in a sincere kind of way At the Tristan screening some folks were on his back for being pouty and sullen and doing the whole James Dean thing but I dont think this true Blind Spot is proof positive of his tremendous talent In this film he carries himself with a different sort of weight entirely Its a unique performance Bittersweet and really moving The lines from his journal cut you like a knife You sense a sharp intelligence of observation behind his words The tone is everything He carries it through the action and suspense as well as the grim bits of gallows humor I like the other two actors a great deal too The blonde girl is totally gorgeous and the man is hysterical in his twisted tough guy stoicism Some of the thugs seemed a little sketchy but this is a minipoint really The film is totally solid and Franco is way cool all around
1,Andy Lau and Lau ChingWan are both superb in Johnny Tos tautly directed crime thriller which puts most Western efforts to shame Think of it as the Hong Kong Heat only better Everything about the film screams class from the performances to the soundtrack the cinematography to the script The tone remains serious throughout but the film has a nice line in blackhumour friendship and romance at its heart Sure it gets a little preposterous later on but it would be a hardhearted viewer who didnt find something to love about this movie Thank God Hollywood hasnt yet remade and ruined a classic Do yourself a favour and see this film
1,I saw this film when it first came out and didnt know what to expect exactly What followed the Overture was one of the most pleasurable filmgoing experiences I have ever had A lush score of songs and music by Britisher Leslie Bricusse of Doctor Doolittle  Wilie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory fame as well as making his mark on the Broadway musical scene and scored by the incomparable John Williams Theres not a bad song in the entire film Plus some of the most exquisite cinematography costume design and filming locations I have ever seen in one film Not to mention the Academy Award nominated performance by Peter OToole and the equally strong performance in my opinion by the wonderful Petula Clark Now given that Peter is not the same caliber a singer that Petula is he still manages to sell his songs to the audience and that after all is what it is all about This is a faithful adaptation of the excellent book by James Hilton and deserves to be treasured for generations to come I recommend this film for family viewing though most men will consider this a chick flick But if you like a truly great film musical then this film is for you But be warned that a standby box of Kleenex is just as important as popcorn for your viewing pleasure
1,I think the film makes a subtile reference to rouge of Kieslowski as the whole atmosphere gives me a feeling of red It seems to be that a lot of the backgrounds contain red think of the tearoom fe I also think this is one of the greatest movies of the last years
1,An extremely dark and brooding show with an excellent cast One of the few shows that I try to watch on a regular basis Glad to see Bebe Neuwirth in a recurring role but feel Andre Braugher is underutilized He is one intense actor Hope CBS gives it a better time slot next season
1,Ive avoided seeing this film for some time but finally picked up a copy Having been born too late to see Hair in its contemporary setting I have just been familiar with the UK and Broadway cast recordings for many years and saw it on stage in the late 1980s where it looked a little creaky but still great fun The film It drops some of the songs The Bed My Conviction Frank Mills and cuts others Walking in Space However what is left is presented very well indeed All the singers and dancers are excellent and the key performers especially Treat Williams as Berger Beverley DAngelo as Sheila John Savage as Claude are memorable As a hippy celebration and anthem Hair manages to be remain potent even in a film made ten years too late It was no longer the era of peace love and Biba but the time of punk rock  although watching this film now in the time of Iraqi problems gives a new resonance to the Vietnam issues of the 1960s Milos Forman who also made Amadeus did a good job on directing In its scope and feel it reminds me of Norman Jewisons Jesus Christ Superstar especially with the joy of the Aquarius scene and the intimacy of Easy To Be Hard I really enjoyed this film and consider it a good representation of a musical born out of the first truly hedonistic era
1,We see at the beginning of Little Dieter Needs to Fly Dieter Dengler the subject of the film an obsessivecompulsive Or at least thats what he seems to be by way of constantly openingclosing doors and with his large stockpile of food in the cellar In a way director Werner Herzog sets up a central question in a manner of speaking to why Dieter is like this Well in fact hes not necessarily obsessivecompulsive as he is just well prepared And why shouldnt he be after the life hes lived Aside from the juiciest most dark and exhilarating and frightening and just downright haunting story of survival thats the core of the picture the backstory to Dieter is fascinating too Dieters own childhood for example was already a slog from the start being in postwar Germnay poor in a family without much food or prospects eating wallpaper for the blue in the walls But enter in a passion an unyielding desire which of course is part of Herzogs bread  butter and love of man in his films which is flying and for Dieter there was nothing else but to fulfill this What it ends up leading to after becoming an American citizen is more than he couldve bargained for Dieter is one of Herzogs most compelling quirky and compassionately observed figures in his whole career a man whos memory is scarred by brutal memories of his time being a Vietnam POW though at the least it provides for some of the most compelling storytelling in any documentary of the last 20 years Ironically the storytelling comes through unlike in The Wild Blue Yonder mostly in lots and lots of exposition from Dieter on some of the most minute details of his time in the different prison camps the torture tactics the bugs the brutal wretched violence and threats like with the wedding ring tale and leading into the most interesting and sad portions with his best friend Duane They escaped the prisons together but found that their journey to reach Cambodia would not be so easy Now through most of this the talking does something that is enthralling which is that as Dieter goes through his stories and occasionally does reenactments in fashion Herzog could only do with Dieter already middleaged being led in handcuffs et all through the jungle one can picture all of this in the mind It all becomes even more vivid to try and get these little details and the intensity of it all together into a form of reality That Herzog keeps these portions simple and knows when to hold Dieter back in his answers makes him all the more a key figure of interest Hes not ever totally normal but unlike a Timothy Treadwell you wont think ever really about laughing at him either So along with his hero whether of war or not is hard to say as Dieter disputes that claim as saying the ones who died were the real heroes typical but perhaps quite true Herzog stylizes his film with a mix of old stock footage when detailing Dieters early life the period footage of WW2 scenes and post German rubble is always a captivating sight and with Herzog gets up a notch in his timing and assemblage with music and in capturing the footage of Vietnam in aerial viewings of jungles and fields Herzog is also very wise at not injecting politics much at all into the proceedings theres no I was used by the Americans or whatever thrown into the mix Theres even a sense that Dieter doesnt hold too much of a grudge with everything that happened to him that its just what happens in time of war and of course he WAS dropping bombs on people from his plane Now through much of these harrowing and even in the smaller bits involving what went on in prisons bathrooms and the scraps of food its always harrowing luckily Herzog keeps a level of humor in check as well One of my very favorite scenes in the film where Herzog breaks away for a moment from Dieter is when he shows a trainee film used for American soldiers meant to show what should happen in case they get abandoned in the jungle alonewith all of the gear that they could possibly have including a knife a flare gun and a very fast helicopter to come around and this is put to hilariously deadpan voiceover work Yet even the moments where one laughs only brings to mind the moments of absurdity in a time of absolute crisis and how one cant ever really imagine what its like to be alone in a foreign territory surrounded by people who will do anything to keep said person as a form of collateral in wartime Dieter aside from knowing that flying and airplanes are the only way of life he would ever want to have and Herzog ends the film on a wonderfully somber elegiac note where he flies over a large field of airplanes knows what it is to have to survive at all costs But yet as well as in many of Herzogs protagonist driven films theres the near unalterable spirit that will keep on enduring if ones strong enough even through horrid moments the fate of Dunae and problems all the way up to the rescue by the helicopter is he American or a spy they ask on the chopper Dieter is such a man with a spirit and hes given via Herzog a fantastic tragic creative wellshot albeit maybe too short tribute to his life And of course it pumps me up even more for the upcoming dramatization Rescue Dawn
1,This film is about two horse traders who agree to escort a small group of Mormons across the desert Along the way they encounter a murderous family of thugs who menace the peaceful folks and put their pilgrimage in jeopardy WAGON MASTER is what I would term a little John Ford film as it obviously did not have the budget or scope of some of his other Westerns In particular this film lacks the bigname stars like John Wayne but allows some of the usual supporting characters to take center stage Longtime Ford stock character actors Ben Johnson Harry Carey Jr and Ward Bond have been elevated to starring roles and perhaps the one who came of as the lead was probably Johnsonthough the other two got nearly as much screen time and focus This is not a bad thing as the film worked just fine without the big starand is well worth seeing Now this isnt to say I loved the movie It was very good but certainly not perfect In particular as far as the music goes youll probably either love it or hate it I found the Sons of the Pioneers music a bit schmaltzy at times It did evoke a nice mood but seemed to occasionally dominate the scenes I think a little would have worked much better Plus with their incessant singing in the background I kept expecting Roy Rogers to pop out at any moment Another minor problem is that the plot was amazingly simple and the ending was pretty much a foregone conclusion However and I am glad to say there is a however despite this being rather formulaic and sentimental the film still worked well This was primarily due to John Fords nice as usual direction as well as Ben Johnsons exceptional performance He was able to provide an excellent anchor for the film Another plus for me is that I saw this in the same week as BRIGHAM YOUNG another film about the Mormon migration While BRIGHAM YOUNG was a bit silly and overly saintly in its portrayals here the Mormons were less perfect and more like real peoplewith foibles and personalities Oh and speaking of BRIGHAM YOUNG it seems as if Jane Darwell was the go to girl for Mormonthemed films during this era as she was a major supporting character in both films Considering that she died in BRIGHAM YOUNG and it was set about 20 years before WAGON MASTER this is some stunt Also if youd like to catch a glimpse of the famous Jim Thorpe hes in a tiny role where he plays the impassive Indian dancing next to Jane Darwell around the camp fire
1,I happened to catch this on community TV a few years back and was pleasantly surprised how enjoyable a film it was While a bit corny in certain ways as its prime function of being a mystery thriller it works superbly thanks to a script that concocts an ingenious plot it kept me guessing throughout and the resolution is inspired The cast is a starstudded one containing a mixture of those at the end of their careers indeed Richard Long died the same year this was made or those who were on the verge of stardom in hit TV series Kate Jackson Tom Bosley They all do a good job with the exception of Cesare Danova who sleepwalks through his role Strongly recommended
1,A fun rompa lot of good twists and turns and we were not even baked Didnt know this movie even existed until watching the extra trailers on a Monty Python DVDoddly it was there along with The City of Lost Children and The Adventures of Baron Munchauhsen The plot keeps you wondering throughout The acting was awesomeHank Azaria shows his talent again Bill Bob is Billy Bobwecis Definitely worth watching
1,I would like if they brought back surface I really enjoyed the show along with my family I felt the plot development and storyline were first rate Like the other person said it seems that everything gets reduced to the lowest common denominator Nothing but bland politically correct junk survives Just look at the internet to see how many people were watching the show Also it is not nice to leave us hanging as to what happened the all of the characters on the show This is the same thing that happened to the time travel show I think was called 8 days but should have been called backstep Did the Olympics kill surface I know the writers strike killed another one of my favorite shows years ago called greatest American hero
1,There are so many positive reviews on Return to Me that my opinion is not necessary to encourage you to watch this movie However I feel the need to express my admiration for this unique movie Bonnie Hunt has proved that she is not only an exceptional actress but also a marvelous director and script writer This movie has everything and is full of humanity tenderness sense of humor  Dont miss it dont wait any longer And regarding the poor reviews dont pay any attention Some viewers forget that this type of movies have to be watched with your heart not only with your eyes If some viewers prefer Notting Hill or Youve got Mail thats their mistake For me Return to Me is a true gem an unforgettable movie

1,This the the final feature film that Michelangelo Antonioni directed with the help of Wim Wenders and adapts from his short story collection That Bowling Alley on the Tiber Beyond the Clouds contain 4 short stories with familiar themes that weve come to be accustomed to from his earlier works and sums up those themes in vignettes which are weaved together via Wenders directed scenes involving John Malkovichs The Director character However most of the stories seemed to offer little or no depth that were used to from an Antonioni movie while Malkovichs narration of supposed depth rattled on with unclear diction that sounded a tad pretentious and out of place Nonetheless all four stories seem to touch on chance encounters and extremely quick romances that played out more like lust at first sight perhaps due to the lack of time since theyre short stories anyway to allow for a more layered approach to carefully define and craft the characters as we know from a typical Antonioni movie And the obsessive approach here is for the characters to disrobe to showcase a lack of deeper connection sacrificed for the immediate satisfaction of the flesh Maybe this is the point to want to bring across with an observation of the more modern relationship The first story Story of a Love Affair That Never Existed tells the romance between Silvano Kim Rossi Stuart and Carmen Ines Sastre who meet when one asks the other for directions to a hotel and later meet at a cafe Its as if Fate is playing games on them when they meet but part and meet again much later but like the games people play its almost like a LAvventura or a La Notte with the lack of communication and of the expectations from the man John Malkovichs director character takes central role in the next short who exhibited some really lecherous looks toward a girl working at a shop played by Sophie Marceau She is deeply disturbed and made to feel uncomfortable but somehow plucked up the courage to approach him and in what I thought was to scare him off tells him her background that she murdered her father by stabbing him 12 times But in a flash these two are off toward bedroom gymnastics The next short Dont Look for Me is the longest of the lot with Peter Weller playing a cheating husband who has to choose between his mistress Chiara Caselli or his wife played by Fanny Ardant Perhaps the more star studded of the lot with Jean Reno also stepping in for a coda at the end of it which sort of expands the little universe in which this short exists But unfortunately Renos involvement also got relegated to some stifle of laughter as it goes into the implausible domain with laser quick romantic tanglements There was a key element adapted from LEclisse with a kiss between a couple through a glass panel too while the introductory tale about the story of souls was quite interesting If theres a negative theme here this short wants to play upon itll be the duplicity of man In between this short and the next was a small scene which reunited our couple from La Notte Marcello Mastroianni and Jeanne Moreau where the former was painting a landscape which was reminiscent of that in Red Desert Finally we have the final shot This Body of Dirt with Vincent Perez as a young man going after a girl Irene Jacob whom he just met and falling in love with her only to realize that it is a love that is too late Its a relatively talkie piece just like the first story with the characters engaging in conversation while walking the streets of the city theyre in which sort of brings to mind Richard Linklaters Before Sunrise While on the whole the movie may have succeeded as individual pieces they never quite measure up as a combined effort given the excuse to link them up was a film directors exploration of possible stories and a look for inspiration for his next film
1,when I first heard about this movie I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s I noticed the music was by Elton John so I figured I had nothing to loose so I got it What a Surprise The movie was awesome It was true love is all about The characters Paul and Michelle had no luxuries no money and sometimes no food yet they were still happy I recommended this film to all my friends but they all critized my tastes and even called me names becuase the movie featured two minors naked I think that only made the movie more realistic The cinematography was great and it only come to show the great abilities of director Lewis Gilbert
1,This is by far the funniest sitcom that has ever aired on TV I own all 9 seasons on DVD and literally could watch them over and over Anyone who does not find this show hilarious heartwarming entertaining and laugh out loud hysterical is crazy Kevin James is absolutely one of the most talented comedians out there My boyfriend and I love going to stand up comedy shows in Boston where we live and have seen Kevin James twice and his brother Gary Valentine Danny once They are both so unbelievably talented and just plan smart with their work There are so many comedians out there that are just awful and Kevin and Gary really show the true side of real comedy Leah Remini although a snob and bitch in real life so I have read is an amazing actress and deserves more credit than any other woman in sitcoms She truly makes the showalong with Jerry Stiller This show is a must see and you will get addicted within one to two episodes
1,While it may not be his most laughpacked film MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE stands as one of Charley Chases most satisfying farce comedies twenty minutes of clever sight gags nicely choreographed physical comedy and amusing quips rendered via title card of course all based on a wacky and wildly implausible premise Were told up top that this is a story of homely people a wife with a face that would stop a clock and her husband with a face that would start it again Soon we meet bucktoothed Charley Moose and his wife Vivien who has an enormous nose But theres no point in discussing plausibility when our plot hinges on such a patently unbelievable series of interconnected coincidences ie first that Charley would have his overbite corrected the very day his wife would have her nose fixed second that each spouse would keep their respective cosmetic surgeries secret from the other and third that when bumping into each other in public afterward Charley and Vivien wouldnt recognize each other Sounds like a bit of a stretch doesnt it Multiple stretches is more like it Clearly were in the world of farce here and just have to roll with the silly plot twists so as long as you can relax and forget about plausibility youre likely to enjoy this short MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE gets off to a leisurely start as the various complications of the story are established but things pick up once Charley and Vivien have met and made a date to attend a party together at the home of Charleys dentist They each rush home excitedly enter separately and are at first unaware of each others presence Mr  Mrs Moose appear to be quite wealthy incidentally as they live in a mansion the size of a luxury hotel There follows a beautifully timed sequence somewhat reminiscent of Buster Keatons THE NAVIGATOR in which husband and wife dash about the house without ever quite meeting up facetoface And once they arrive at the party the comedy really kicks into high gear as Charley is forced to dance with gawky wallflower Gale Henry Henry an estimable player in her own right who starred in many short comedies dating back to 1914 is hilarious as the dance partner who brings great vigor but little grace to her dancing Theres also an elegant cinematic touch during this sequence when the camera pans down to show us only the shoes of Charley Gale Vivien and Viviens dance partner yet were able to follow precisely whats happening between the principles by watching their feet Unfortunately for Charley and Vivien the party theyre attending is raided and from there on the complications multiply when they manage to escape the police dragnet and return home When Charley realizes that his newlyprettified wife was attempting to step out with another man he resolves to each her a lesson    while conveniently forgetting of course that he was attempting to do the very same thing The last few minutes of this film offer some of Chases funniest physical comedy capped with a good sight gag for the punchline MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE leaves the viewer with a warm glow and surely ranks with the most amusing comedies produced by the prolific sadly underrated Charley Chase
1,Somehow I missed many of the early Farscape episodes so Im seeing them in all sorts of orders as they are repeated on various channels I first caught it  entirely by accident  whilst lounging in a hotel room The first 10 seconds had me completely hooked  THIS is what SF is all about The characters are strong and MoyaPilot the living ship is what Lexx should have been The plots vary in quality but none falls below excellent in my opinion And I have to mention Rygel  what a gloriously irreverent character None of your smarmy sugarcoated Star Trek aliens here this is the real deal  cynical selfserving and replete with disgusting personal habits Rygel is the creation of a genius Last week the SciFi channel showed Out of their minds the bodyswapping episode A true classic I couldnt stop laughing from start to finish Long may Farscape grace our screens
1,Kevin Kline offers a brilliant comic turn in the 1997 comedy IN  OUT Kline plays Howard Brackett a small town history teacher who excitedly sits down to watch the Academy Awards this year because one of his former students Matt Dillon is a nominee He is nominated for his performance in a film where he plays a gay soldier and when he wins he thanks Howard in his speech for inspiring him because Howard is gay Now this floors Howard because he as no clue why thus guy would say this on international television Howard is even engaged to be married to Joan Cusack in an Oscarnominated performanceso he has no idea where Dillons Cameron Drake got the idea that he is gay and finds he has to defend himself to everyone at school but is shocked that no one seemed terribly shocked by what Cameron said on the Oscars Howard has a birthday party where he is given birthday presents like the soundtrack to YENTL and ends up explaining to his guests why Barbra Streisand had to make FUNNY LADY His parents Wilford Brimley Debbie Reynolds are shocked but promise to support their son even if he is gay He also gets a visit from an out of town reporter Tom Selleck who wants to do an article about him because hes gay too The moment when Selleck plants a big kiss right on Klines lips is a classic But all of these little things have Howard actually questioning his sexuality and wondering if he really is gaymuch to the aggravation and frustration of his fiancée Cusack who is beyond confused The scene where she leaves a bar in her wedding gown and stands in the middle of street screaming about the lack of single straight men in the world is a classic But what I like about this movie is the way Kline fully invests in the role and was not afraid to look foolish or look gay There is a fabulous scene probably the most famous from the film where he buys a record on how to be macho and the guy on the record is talking about how real men dont dance and a disco tune comes on I WILL SURVIVE if memory servesand the narrator on the record says no matter what you do dont dance but Howard cant help himself and he ends up shaking his groove thing all over the room Its hysterically funny and Kline plays it with sincerity and gusto The film is not pro or anti gayits just a deft and amusing character study about a man trying to figure out exactly who he is Wonderful film
1,The Spirit of St Louis is Billy Wilders film tribute to one of the best figures in aeronautical history remembered for the first nonstop solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean in May 1927 with James Stewart a little too old for the part playing Charles Lindbergh As a tribute it is eloquent enough and although a few nice liberties may have been taken with historical fact the motion picture describing the detailed odyssey before and after the Paris flight on May 2021 in the monoplane Spirit of St Louis Although the lengthy internal monologue employed during the journey may be disappointing to an audience the truth is that it helps keep the picture focused tightly on its essential point Stewart dignified the portrait of one of the greatest adventurers in the air the world has ever know departing in a highly modified single engine monoplane from Long Island New York to Paris France No action is depicted in the trip only some flashbacks to break up the monotony of the long flight But there is superb determination of the ordeal of a brave and talented pilot decided to fly alone His equation is simple less weight one engine one pilot would increase fuel efficiency and allow for a longer flying range but with so much risk Lindberghs claim to fame was doing something that many had tried and failed Even though Wilder has bravely put it upon the screen in a calm unhurried fashion it comes out as biography of intense restraint and power But it is James Stewarts performance controlled to the last detail that gives life and strong heroic stature to the principal figure in the film From it there emerges an awareness of a clever firm but truly humble man who tackles a task with resolution plans as much about it as he can makes his decisions with courageous finality and then awaits with only one thought in mind to get to Paris In his efforts to cut off the planes weight any item considered too heavy or unnecessary was left behind The recordsetting flight proved not only to be a fight with the elements and a test of navigation but also a long battle against fatigue A busy schedule and an active mind kept Lindbergh up all of the previous night Still he managed to stay conscious enough to keep the monoplane from crashing and landed at Le Bourget Aerodrome near Paris 33 hours and 30 minutes after leaving New York Stewart gives an able portrait of a brave pilot who attains legendary status emphasizing the intention and dominant resolution to fly nonstop 5810 kilometers 3610 miles across the Atlantic Photographed in CinemaScope and WarnerColor and backed by Franz Waxmans beautiful music the film effectively captures the pioneering spirit of the era and the heros ultimate achievement since he takes off that day from Roosevelt wet field and clears telephone wires at the end of the runway
1,This is the episode that probably most closely relates to its partner law Thou Shalt Not Kill in that it directly brings up the ever controversial issue Why do we kill people who kill people to show that killing is wrong This issue is presented in two parts within the episode before the killing when the film shows the dichotomy between the idealistic upandcoming lawyer and the street thug so caught up in his ways that his life is merely a representation of what hes supposed to do followed by the period after the trial and before the execution when both are made to suffer for the deaths they feel responsible for and thus share One of the great things about the way these episodes work are in the both small and big ways the story is fully developed so that we understand both the motivations and histories of characters were only able to spend slightly less than an hour with For all his criminal intentions and mockery the killer is still very sympathetic revolving the most important part of his actions around a history of accidental death His way of killing is more a desire to control death than it is any desire to actually destroy Similarly the lawyers idealistic naivety shows one unwilling to allow death to happen in a world where he cant control it Their meeting is indeed important they both have to give in to it while not propagating it As an aside its interesting how much this episode affects viewing of Rouge Kieslowskis later completion of the Trois Colours trilogy One of Kieslowskis biggest influences seems to be the idea of justice and considering that the Decalogue is a meditation on something that represents Divine Justice this one seems almost the most selfconscious PolarisDiB
1,Thirst I found that this film was beautifully crafted The cinematography was well above excellent I though almost any frame could be frozen and you would have yourself an exquisite photograph The use of color stands out most In many instances the camera was gliding through the scene and the work was flawless Park Chan Wooks direction was fantastic He had me believing unwaveringly in his far fetched universe There were several touches of verbal and visual humor of a dark nature that just added another depth to the picture as a whole The acting I would not call outstanding but it suited the film and worked well enough For me the only place where this film lacked was in the story At times I will not lie the goings on between characters just did not make sense Sometimes the story flow was clunky Overall I was disappointed with the subdued narrative and I felt it ran a little too long But I still recommend this film for its vision its visual flourish its dark humor and at the end of the day it is an interesting film even if imperfect 910
1,From the perspective of the hectic contemporary world in which we live the so called good old days always seem so much more serene and innocent an idyllic era gone by of which we have only memories and shadows that linger on the silver screen as with Christmas In Connecticut a warm and endearing film directed by Peter Godfrey Barbara Stanwyck stars as Elizabeth Lane a popular Martha Stewart type magazine columnist who writes about life on her beloved farm in Connecticut always with the latest recipe at the center of the story One of her biggest fans is Alexander Yardley played by Sidney Greenstreet the publisher of the magazine for which she writes Yardley has never visited her farm and in response to an idea expressed to him in a letter from a nurse Mary Joyce Compton he decides to spend an old fashioned Christmas with Elizabeth her husband and child and as a special guest a certain Mr Jefferson Jones Dennis Morgan a sailor just recovered from spending fifteen days at sea on a raft after his ship was torpedoed Elizabeth of course cannot refuse her boss but there are problems not the least of which is the fact that she has no farm and writes her column from the comfort of a highrise in the city It makes for a precarious situation for her as well as her editor Dudley Beecham Robert Shayne as the one thing Mr Yardley demands from his employees is total honesty What follows is a charming and delightfully romantic comedy that transports the audience back to a seemingly more simple time and place to share a Christmas Past where a warm hearth good food and kindness prevail Barbara Stanwyck absolutely sparkles as Elizabeth with a smile and presence warmer than anything the grandest hearth could provide and totally convincing as a city girl entirely out of her element on the farm Morgan also fares well as the somewhat naive sailor whose trust in his fellow man is admirable Even with the deceptions being played out around him hes the kind of guy you know will somehow land on his feet and in the end its Elizabeth you really feel for One of the true delights of this film however is Sidney Greenstreet His Yardley has a gruff exterior but beneath you know without a doubt that this is a man with a heart as big as Texas Its a straightforward honest portrayal and its a joy to watch him work the most memorable scenes in the movie belong to him The supporting cast includes Reginald Gardiner John Sloan the terrific Una OConnor Norah Frank Jenks Sinkewicz and Dick Elliott Judge Crothers A feelgood movie that plays especially well during the Christmas Season though it would work any time of the year Christmas In Connecticut is a memorable film that never takes itself too seriously is thoroughly uplifting and will leave you with a warm spot in your heart and a sense of peace that makes the world seem like a good place to be Its a true classic and one you do not want to miss I rate this one 1010

1,Boogie Nights is a masterpiece it tells a great story with flair an great direction from a very talented director This film features a cast which turn in outstanding performances Though the subject matter is very controversial but it is handled with great care by very talented people This movie has an unexpected emotional impact also you will remember it long after it is over
1,Ive just seen this movie in a preview and I can only recommend to watch it It was about 90 minutes long and when it was over I felt like it could go on for hours The stories of the protagonists are so realistic and you feel really at home The movie basically consists of dialogs but I wasnt bored a minute 18 people of really different characters and each one of them acted out so well I had to laugh felt awkward was sad and still felt happiness All in all it is a movie that shows the different kinds of people in our society the way they communicate and how love has changed and nowadays is handled as an economic thing Dating becomes something that is similar to an audition The whole audience loved it So please watch it if theres a possibility Youll love it
1,After 10 viewings in 20 years I too think this was the Crazy Gangs best effort on film with more cohesion in the plot than their next best Alfs Button Afloat They were indeed a crazy trio of double acts thrown together mainly on stage sometimes in front of royalty until Chesney Allen retired in the 40s through illhealth He outlived them all by years Apparently they were just as mad outside work regularly playing practical jokes on one another The Six Wonder Boys troupe head for IllGetHerToTellMe Alaska to dig for the gold that was being found there It seemed a better idea than going to Mansfield  because theyd been there When they get to Red Gulch they find their information was a mere 40 years out of date  they thought that the chips that were in the guilty newspaper theyd read tasted funny But by then it doesnt matter as theyve all fallen in love with Snow White and want to help her grandad find his long lost stash of gold Baddie Bill M McGrew wants it himself however The number of verbal and visual puns is astonishing but most of them will probably only make sense to Brits and expats interested in seeing 30s British bw comedies Imho nearly all of the gags and routines work including the Gold If patter between Bud  Chesney and the Whistle While You Work pastiche  even the Always Getting Our Man Mountie inserts A marvellous little film in a rather tired looking condition but utterly recommended
1,Turner and friends are closing in on HBO for the top spot among madeforTV movie producers This is a nicely paced contemplative thriller of sorts William Macy is stellar as always and Adam Arkin offers one of his better performances A bit more lively than classic Hitchcock but not as inyourface as typical movies of its type A Slight Case of Murder eases you in and never lets go Note I saw a preview copy which means I didnt have to wait through commercials Those interruptions may hurt the pacing but you know this will be available on video sometime
1,This movie is not the scariest of all time but it is a great example of a campy eighties horror flick  low budget no stars lots of inventive death scenes and enough nudity to keep the teenagers in their seats The premise is interesting and fun and the three evil kids play their parts well A nice starting point for Just Say Julie Brown exposing her talents early in her career This film wont be seen by many but for fans of 80s horror its a must
1,Although the plot of Cover Girl is very flimsy and tired it does serve well enough as an anchor for the Kern and Gershwin musical numbers Following her signature role in Gilda Hayworth opted to star in this musical that seems tailor made for her Besides looking as gorgeous as ever she impresses with her dancing as well Gene Kelly who was on loan to Columbia from MGM matches her in dancing and the sequence where he cavorts with his own shadow was nicely done The supporting characters were also competently acted Personally I didnt enjoy Cover Girl as much as the musicals Hayworth made with Fred Astaire However Cover Girl is still very entertaining and easy to recommend My score 710
1,I remember this filmit was the first film i had watched at the cinema the picture was dark in places i was very nervous it was back in 7475 my Dad took me my brother  sister to Newbury cinema in Newbury Berkshire England I recall the tigers and the lots of snow in the film also the appearance of Grizzly Adams actor Dan Haggery i think one of the tigers gets shot and dies If anyone knows where to find this on DVD etc please let me knowThe cinema now has been turned in a fitness club which is a very big shame as the nearest cinema now is 20 miles away would love to hear from others who have seen this film or any other like it
1,WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS Written by husband and wife Wally Wolodarsky who also directed and Maya Forbes this indie film is one of the better romantic comedies in recent memory Jay Mohr takes a break from playing smarmy weasels to be the nice guy faced with the fact his fiancée wants to bed other people and hes allowed to do so too Julianne Nicholson who was so good in Tully plays spunky and vulnerable with great gusto Too bad she doesnt get the recognition she deserves  Good supporting performances help immensely too Lauren Graham who made last years Bad Santa memorable plays the jaded cynical sister to perfection Bryan Cranston the dad on TVs Malcolm in the Middle gets a few funny raunchy moments and Andy Richter plays a genial guy who falls for a single mother  Helen Slater in a credible albeit familiar role as a mousy woman What surprised me most about Seeing Other People was how funny it is There are some genuine laughs here Eds first attempt at meaningless sex gets some great lines and theres a ménage a trois that elicits one of the most truthful reactions from a man as the male fantasy gets tweaked The films premise isnt unusual but I liked that it was Alice Nicholson who thought of it much to the chagrin of Ed Mohr Given the genre you know that no matter how good her intentions are Alices plan is doomed We see how the couple works through this strange situation Initially Alice and Ed are turned on by the idea but then the human element sets it I appreciated Forbes and Wolodarsky not turning this into a cheap sex romp Yes theres sex and nudity but there also are real emotions at work here The other people Alice and Ed befriend dont want to be the objects of casual sex they have feelings too In one case too many feelings Granted some scenes run one joke too many the RichterSlater subplot isnt necessary and Alice does something truly uncharacteristic But thats forgivable because Mohr and Nicholson generate such tremendous intimacy and honesty  check out the scenes where Ed rummages through Alices underwear drawer or his reaction to her announcement about ending the experiment  that no matter how much we might enjoy their little game we root for this couple to succeed Unfortunately this film got little if any publicity and a limited release Hollywood studios whose romantic comedies often veer on the unfunny turgid and unsurprising would do well to learn from this intelligent and funny film
1,One of the best As being a fan of the civil war I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten the subjects of love passion grief shame harmony and cruelty come to life I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade Being a young boy you would think that I wouldnt have been interested in this civil war soap To be honest this story stole the hearts of every one in my class and this is just the first book I bought the novel and studied the likes and differences and it was awesome I am 17 now and still enjoy the story characters subject and remember the times of the civil war As a movie director of the future I will always enjoy North and South Book One
1,As a movie THE ITALIAN JOB is ok at best good not great acting nice visuals and pacing a mediocre plot but nothing bad enough to walk out on But as a car commercial for the new breed of MINI Coopers this film is spectacular SPOILERS Ok its a typical heist film with the odd twist the underwater safe cracking was nice if not improbable and the cast was fairly solid with the exception of a putrid Wahlberg but when it all came down to it the real stars of this picture were the three MINI Coopers in all their highflying speedracing rampjumping bullettaking goldlugging shiny new glory The audience I was sitting amongst actually ooed and aahed when Therons little red number first hit the screen strangely enough neither she nor Wahlberg garnered the same reaction The film starts out promising Mos Def Seth Green Donald Sutherland Edward Norton and Jason Statham all begin as an interesting and humourous band of characters with the only real uninspired performance being that of the usually good Mark Wahlberg Why he claims this is his best film I cant imagine his character is completely onenote and he plays him so blandly it was as if Mr Rogers came back from the dead and was inhabiting his body Charlize is fine as Sutherlands daughter though nothing magical Seth Greens character is perfect and the running Napster jokes including a cameo by Napster founder Shawn Fanning are hilarious he and some of Mos Defs early lines add some much needed sparks of humour Unfortunately Edward Norton and Donald Sutherland dont get near enough screen time You can see most of the plot coming from a mile away and the dialogue is rife with bad oneliners and giveaways but I doubt the filmmakers were out to reinvent the wheel here so taken as a typical actionsuspense flick it comes out alright Worth seeing on cheap night Id recommend 710 Not worth its weight in gold but makes for nice fillings
1,I am not a fan of Sean Penn but in contrast to my German colleague whose review appears here I think he was perfectly cast as the neurotic druggy character in this film He has every nuance perfected and reminded me of several acquaintances who had similar tastes in recreational chemistry I saw this film but once 1015 years ago and this is the only part of the film that was etched indelibly on my mind I dont say it very often but in this case I will Bravo Sean Penn As for the story line well its based on fact and as such it is a tragedy that people would sell their countrys secrets to the then enemy Again Penn has shown what you can do if you disagree with the administration Use the freedoms you have paid for in blood dont break the law
1,The Italian Job requires daylight hours and no experience is required This is a great matinee and a good afternoon at the movies The plot is good but the actual playing out of the plot is very simple and requires no thought process Its car chases explosions and all for the simple purpose of defeating the bad guy played by Edward Norton For Norton it seems he is content to portray the exact same characters as in his previous films such as The Score Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron deserve better scripts Warning If youve seen the trailer then you have seen the movie If youre looking for entertainment at inexpensive prices then you need The Italian Job
1,Art imitates life imitates art Atticus Finch is reincarnated into the DA in this tragic and suspenseful gripping documentary that plays more like a whodoneit and how did it happen The authenticity and sometimes reluctant honesty of the individuals make this a compelling story in many layers Although racism is one of the themes there are other elements such as work ethic integrity and coping with grief that have drawn me back to view and review this film again and again The music is driving but not obtrusive the pacing and visuals are such that there is no mistaking the fact that these are real people going through an authentic experience
1,Thats a bad raunchy predictable tacky salacious soap opera The Best of Everything is just such a guilty pleasure for me something along the lines of Valley of the Dolls I mean Best has everything Somebody gets pregnant out of wedlock whens the last time you heard THAT phrase there are affairs everywhere drinking backstabbing jealousy and even a tragic but not altogether unexpected death Caroline Bender Hope Lange and Mike Rice the delicious Stephen Boyd are the centerpieces of the goingson Their chemistry is immediate and is the glue that keeps this film from becoming too fragmented Suzy Parker the offthechart gorgeous exfashion model appears as Gregg Adams an aspiring stage actress a role that according to any biography Ive ever read about her was apparently not much of a stretch But Parker does a surprisingly credible job here more than holding her own in a couple of scenes opposite Louis Jourdan who plays David Savage Jourdan probably took this role for the money and the special screen credit because he was clearly headed down the aging starhasbeen road Diane Baker is fine as naive gullible April Morrison Martha Hyer as Barbara Lemont has a particularly juicy storyline and film legend Joan Crawford chews her usual serving of scenery as Amanda Farrow another role like Jourdans Savage that Crawford likely took for the paycheck There is some obviously dated dialog and plot devices this IS 1959 and the predictability of the soap opera genre But if you like a good soap as I do The Best of Everything will more than satisfy you
1,I just bought this movie yesterday night and I LOVE it Everyone did great acting in it especially Ryan Dunn and Bam Margera The whole plot was great and as Dunn said in the extras on the DVD they made it seem like he was reliving the whole thing all over again This movie has made my number one spot in my favorite movies I cant stop replaying scenes over and over again just to see it again Ive never done that with any other movie I would definitely recommend this to other people to watch because it is such a great movie and if you like Bam Margera its a perfect movie for you The little montages that they show in between every scene are just great I think that those have to be my favorite parts of the movie They are very sad with mostly music from the band HIM which of course is my favorite band
1,A recent reissue of the French crime film original title Du Rififi Chez les Hommes with its famous 20minute silent jewel heist sequence now comes in the US in a gorgeous new print from The Criterion Collection with improved subtitles and some extras Jules Dassin was an American born Julius Dassin in Middletown Connecticut who was forced to make films in Europe because he was Blacklisted Rififi was well publicized in the US and did well in art houses Later Dassin became a lot more famous in the US for Never on Sunday 1960 starring his wife the Greek actress and political activist Melina Mercouri Greece was again glamorized and popularized for Americans and others with Anthony Quinn in Mihalis Kakogiannis 1964 Zorba the Greek which was even a big hit in Cairo The new Rififi DVD includes a recent interview with Dassin I did not previously realize that one of the main robbers Cesar the Milanese was played by Dassin who stepped in when the original actor became unavailable Hes one of the most memorable characters a dandified Italian safe cracker who speaks no French Although this classic has all the trappings of French film noirthe black and white twilight world of well lit apartments shiny black cars men in suits the nightclub scenes including a dramatically filmed and lit title song performed at the club the stony faces and the Gauloises in hand or mouthI dont think its as atmospheric or has quite as distinctive a style as Melvilles films do But theres the mesmerizing robbery which still holds up today as a tour de force It goes like clockwork with a fine sense of craft and teamwork among the robbers Some nosy cops are efficiently dealt with Things quickly go wrong after they go home and distribute the loot when one of the players gets sloppy and gives a dame a ring with a milliondollar bangle in it Has there ever been a heist film whose perps lived happily ever after  Its the wordless heist sequence that guarantees this a special place and Dassin an American director who had an unusually varied and exotic career deserves full credit for that He took a novel so conventional he was going to reject it and added some key elements that make it special In the event he couldnt pass on doing the adaptation he needed the money too much Jean Servais who plays the lead character Tony le Stephanois was an actor rather down on his luck His grim face is perfect for the role He was later to play the lead in Dassins He Who Must Die 1957 which used French actors in Greece for a political tale Topkapi is a somewhat disappointing 1964 caper film it pales compared to Rififi that also got US distribution It does have a good setting but its wasted gone all bland and bright and prettified Of Dassins postHollywood oeuvre Never on Sunday with its catchy theme song and charismatic heroine is the popular choice and won Best Film at Cannes 1960 He Who Must Die the political choice Rififi the genre choice An odd piece is his Phaedra with Mercouri and Tony Perkins 1962 Purists of toughguy Hollywood genre work would eschew these and favor Dassins early films which include a prison drama Brute Force 1947a cop flick The Naked City 1948 and two hard core noirs Thieves Highway 1949 and Night and the City 1950 Personally I tend to like French noir and American neonoir spinoffs better than the original American noir source materialhence my enduring fascination with Rififi But Dassin is rather unique in having not only made Hollywood noir but then going over to Paris and producing a memorable example of its Fifties French derivative

1,Ostensibly a story about the young child of Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day The kid gets kidnapped to keep his parents quiet They know something about a plot to assassinate the ambassador of an unnamed country during a performance at Albert Hall in London The movie is rich in Hitchcockian incidents A friendly but opaque Frenchman seems to grill the innocent Stewart  a doctor from Indiana  a little too intensely to be merely idly curious Later the Frenchman shows up in Arab disguise a knife in his back and whispers some information about the murder plot to Stewart Stewart tells his wife  Doris Day looking very saucy indeed  but refuses to cooperate with the police and risk his sons life Instead the couple try to track down the assassins buy them off and get their son back taking them from Morocco where Hitchcock has given us his usual tourists eye view of the customs locations and food to London There is a hilarious wild goose chase involving a setto between Stewart and the staff of a taxidermy shop The staff are more concerned about guarding their halfstuffed specimens than anything else and they shuffle around protectively holding the carcasses of a leopard and a swordfish In the course of the scuffle Stewart manages to save his throat from being cut by the swordfish bill but is bitten on the hand by a stuffed tiger the action boosted along by Bernard Hermanns bumptious score The scene ends with Stewart rushing out the door Hitchcock ends it with a shot of a lions head gaping at the slammed door There is also a running gag well done about some visitors waiting around the couples hotel room in London waiting for things to be explained There are two serious issues that are lightly touched on One is the relationship between Stewart and Day which is not as rosy as it ought to be considered as a bourgeois ideal Shes been a stage musical star for some years and is internationally known And shes given it all up to marry an ordinary guy who happens to be a doc Thats understandable in say a nurse or a flight attendant or almost any woman other than an international star with a promising career in her own right It isnt delved into but the edginess is noticeable as it was not in the original version It reminds me a little of an exchange between Joe Dimaggio and his thenwife Marilyn Monroe who had just returned from entertaining the troops in Korea Oh Joe she gushed did you ever see ten thousand people stand up and cheer Seventy thousand muttered Joe former hero of the New York Yankees The second problem is one of allegiance Who is of greater social value Ones own young son Or an unknown ambassador Do we put ourselves or our loved ones at risk for the sake of national stability Day is faced with this dilemma in its starkest form at the climax in the Albert Hall Her solution opts for allegiance to political stability although her motives are problematic Does she scream to save the ambassadors life or does she do so just to release the anxiety that is overwhelming her Cf Alec Guiness falling on the detonator at the end of The Bridge on the River Kwai The photography is extremely good and the settings can be menacing even on a quiet street in a residential neighborhood of London Its midday and Stewart is alone and determined but frightened too There are footsteps echoing on Gulliver Street from someone somewhere Is he being followed Is his life in danger And where the hell is everybody who lives on this street Hitchcock pays such close attention to location details that we can make out the garden wall bonding of the bricks beside him The director had a rare disagreement with Francois Truffaut while being interviewed for Truffauts otherwise laudatory book Truffaut argued that the earlier version of The Man Who Knew Too Much lacked the depth of the later version Hitchcock replied It seems to me you want me to make films for the art house audience but finally agreed that the 1930s version was the work of a talented amateur and this version was the work of a professional No argument there This is Hitchcock pretty much near his zenith
1,My first exposure to Japanese animation director Hayao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli production company was when an Englishdubbed version of Spirited Away was released about 7 years ago What a wonderfully creative and unique film experience that was So on that note I managed to get my movie theatreemployed friend to see this new film of Miyazaki with me especially since he loves all things Disney this movies US distributor Once again all I can say is Wow What awesome visuals concerning the way water is depicted as the oceanand what about the title characters transformation from a goldfish toand seeing how some characters demeanor changesand well watch this movie if you want to know what Im talking about Oh and the voices being used for this Americandubbed version Tina Fey Betty White Liam Neeson Cloris Leachman and Lily Tomlin Good choices all Does everything make sense No but thats part of the childlike charm that permeates throughout Theres plenty of funny scenes concerning Ponyo and the boy and many other people they encounter Oh I think Ive written too much so Ill just highly recommend Hayao Miyazakis Ponyo
1,Its just one of those films youre either love it or hate it my girlfriend and me loved it told my brother to rent it and he hated it said it was too flashy and colloquial then again he only usually goes to see big action movies so probably not enough explosions left him disappointed There were some great new talent Id never heard of the leads before anyway Des Brady the directors brother was especially good Playing a right dick at the start I thought he never would redeem himself but he managed to crawl out of the dark hole he had created and by the end I was really routing for him A very surprising film with a whole lot of heart if you can live without a body count and explosions then this one is very original Yashimo Brixton in the UK
1,I must confess that I dont remember this film very well But certainly I liked it I think it was the best adaptation from Burroughs novel really And of course its one of the best movie from Christopher Lambert A good movie about Tarzan as cult as the ones with Weissmuller
1,Leland follows the story of Leland P Fitzgerald Ryan Gosling a disaffected teenager who has apparently murdered a severely retarded peer the brother of a girl he was dating The issue is not whether he did it or not  Leland admits to it straight away  but rather why Interestingly rather than a crime drama Leland becomes a character story examining why people do what they do  not necessarily the easiest ground to till And Leland features the required indie group of screwedup people Aside from the title character theres also Pearl Don Cheadle who is his teacher at the juvenile correctional facility and who sees straight off that Leland is different We meet Lelands distant and egotistical father Kevin Spacey in an extended cameo who never seems emotionally stirred in any way by what his son did But the real flavorings come out when we immerse ourselves in the Pollards the family of the retarded child First theres Lelands girlfriend Becky Jena Malone a drug addict who cant keep herself clean her sister Julie Michelle Williams perhaps the most normal person in the film who merely seeks to get away from it all and Allen Harris Chris Klein a young man who lives with the Pollards and is Julies boyfriend Lastly theres Ryan Michael Welch whom all the others call goofball who cannot communicate and seems barely aware of his surroundings Leland focuses primarily on its eponymous protagonist but the movie slowly  occasionally too slowly  burrows into everyones lives asking the chief question why do people do what they do While Leland discusses it openly in a journal Pearl allows him to keep examining notions of good and bad and personal responsibility all the characters at some point in the film face a moment where they must make the fundamental choice of their own happiness or anothers perhaps the most basic choice any human can make And the movie takes a good look at what goes into those choices and the consequences of them In the beginning of the film youre simply struck by the depth of the cast Spacey Cheadle Gosling Michelle Williams Even Chris Klein  these are people who for the most part tend to elevate any film they are in and putting them all together makes for a heady brew For a space in the middle the film seems to stall sputtering along as it unfolds it looks for a while as if it will be content merely to ask questions and not supply any answers But when we arrive at the home stretch and the movie starts to hit its stride and come together Leland becomes a quietly powerful piece of filmmaking Lelands explanation of the world and his actions in the end bring every story into focus and all the investment youve made in the film pays off Saying Ryan Gosling is excellent is like saying a sunny day is nice At this point in his career its redundant  this is one of the finest young actors working today and it is a pleasure to watch him craft what could have been an unlikable character into a thoughtprovoking protagonist Gosling employs such subtlety here that it hardly seems like acting he has to face off most of the film opposite Don Cheadle whom we know has the goods and he not only holds his own he elevates Cheadles game as well Cheadle himself is in top notch form imbuing Pearl with a fullyrounded humanity  for good and bad Spacey is kind of onenote but thats the character and he handles it excellently I was surprised by Chris Klein with this level of acting I thought he would be buried in the mix but he gives probably the turn of his career so far Terrific work all around Leland is a bit of a downer and again its draggy in spots But it finishes strongly and leaves a lasting impact on the viewer on this one anyway Theres also a subtle commentary on racism in the film in Lelands first day in juvenile hall class hes the only white person in the room that like much of the movie is very effectively handled I wouldnt go so far as to call this required viewing  some might find it too slow or too odd  but I thought it was one of the better films Ive seen in a while far stronger and more satisfying than most fare out there Id recommend it  with the above caveats  if for no other reason than to watch Gosling further perfect his craft
1,I hope the writer director editor and composer and lets not forget producer read this because their work was truly incredible on this movie Let me start by saying that I am in no way affiliated with this movie I am only a regular guy who has been a fan of this movie for about 12 years and have seen it about 8 times Every second of this movie is touching Every scene is classic The acting is real The movie is honest You can relate to these characters as people not actors This tale follows three distinct killers at different stages in their lives The story is carefully thought out and every subplot is intertwined and woven together culminating in a message that leaves us pondering the values of right and wrong that each of us carries inside Crispen Glover Daniel Roebuck Dennis Hopper and Joshua John Miller as a 12 year old boy give absolutely amazing real performances Ive seen this movie about 8 or more times and I still get so absorbed in their performances that I forget I am watching a movie Its that good Great job everyone who worked on this Great job The music is also wonderfully matched and haunting With the chosen cast the carefully timed editing and pacing the mood and tone and even the subject matter the director made some of the best decisions for a movie Ive ever seen This movie is real Its honest Its a true movie experience which I will never forget You may not be into the subject matter but it is something you cannot ignore Ultimately its about people being people and everyone can relate to that I recommend this movie to fans of drama suspense and horror above almost every other film
1,One of the greatest crimes made against Scifi television was the cancellation of Farscape One of the most wellwritten wellacted and overall best shows ever to grace the airwaves it set new standards for Scifi television Once the flagship highest rated critically acclaied show of the SciFi Channel it defies explaination as to why shows like Buffy Tremors The Series and even StarGate SG1 have lasted as long as they have Yes even Buffy But Ill save my Buffy bashing for another time Farscape was poorly treated by the SciFi channel continually tossed around in scheduling reruns rarely shown and never really advertised But while the show has been cancelled all those involved in the production of the show want to bring the show back even Henson Company CEO Brian Henson There is also an extensive fanbased movement to bring the show back  Overall things are looking far from dark and hopefully fans will get their season 5
1,OK this doesnt compare to the explosive tempo of the first parts opening sequence nor to its visual shock value nor for that matter to the melancholic suspense of the second installment No its surprisingly and refreshingly different apart of course from the two main actors The tongueincheek futuristic scenario drives the characters towards each other across genres and languages with an almost gravitational force The moment of impactconclusion is your choice of aShakespearean metaphor of life and humanity in a cartoon costume bsublimation of violence into homoerotics chumorous detonation of an impossible buildup Everything up to then is even less unequivocal Highly recommended to indiscriminate movie buffs who dont mind following foie gras with a hot dog caution to those with more refined palates
1,I first saw this movie when I was in elementary school back in the 1960s I was fascinated with the character played by Ingrid Bergman and it was my introduction to the French Quarter of New Orleans The first part of the movie is the best as she comes back to exact some revenge on her fathers wife and daughter her mother had been driven out in disgrace During this time she meets the wonderful Clint Maroon played by Gary Cooper The chemistry between the two is great The second half of the movie takes place in Saratoga NY the Saratoga of the title and I never enjoy it as much as the New Orleans setting but its still very good I give this movie a ten  partly out of nostalgia but mostly because its just a darn good movie and the characters besides those of Bergman and Cooper are equally wonderful Flora Robson comes close to stealing the scenes from Bergman It used to be shown on TV periodically but its shown rarely if ever  it would be a good one for one of the classic movie stations to pick up and put into their programming cycles
1,East Side Story is a documentary of musical comedy in Stalinist Russia and later in the eastern European satellite comedies with many clips from the films and commentary from the survivors Although some of the Stalinist films look laughingly bad The Bright Road  being a notable exception the films from the sixties actually look pretty good My Wife Wants to Sing The White Mouse and Midnight Revue look particularly entertaining The producers had to contend with the censors who had the power to decide what was politically correct which led to some confusion humorous in retrospect since the people whom the censors were trying to appease were the very people who supported making the films to begin with Since musical comedies were fairly rare behind the Iron Curtainthere were only something like forty made in forty yearsthey had a disproportionate effect upon their audiences who made major hits of some of the films I notice that the sound for the sixties films was much better The directors often had to make do with antiquated equipment and stringent power regulationsthey had to film in seven minute takes or lessand dangerous officicrats I also notice that West Side Story seems to have had a strong influence on Hot Summer The later films may not measure up to Singin in the Rain but they certainly look like they beat the hell out of Bye Bye Birdy
1,Ich will danke Herr Hacke für den Filme Mein Deutsch ist nicht gut Enschuldigen Sie First of all i didnt know how diverse the sound of Istanbul inspite i live in TurkeyFaith Akin and Alexander Hacke have made a different approach for Turkish musicNarrating performing seeing Istanbul and Istanbul Music from a foreigner aspect had given the real meaning of the music itself In this movie I had found out how different ourTurkish culture is how interesting our performers are and how much respect they deserve Unfortunately no one have been able to serve this kind of documentary before
1,One of the intriguing aspects of this historical drama is the way the Tories or British American Loyalists are portrayed and the sort of gloss given to their ardent support for King George III In many ways the American Revolution was definitely a family affair in that some of the wealthier colonial families were split asunder by it If there is a strong criticism to be made of this film it is that perhaps the people in this story are made out to be a little bit nicer than they were in real life In some regards the actions of the character of Major Boulton played by Cornel Wilde make him the least likable member of the cast and the flaw in the storyline He seems to vary from being a prickly kind of patriot to being a kind of anything for the cause fellow This film does concentrate heavily on the notions of personal honor and personal prestige which were a major social norm in that day and age In its subtext the fact that about twentyfive percent of the colonial population was decidedly proBritish is glossed over too But the strength of the Tory element is not obviously maligned although the good doctor character is about eightyfive percent upper class twit  to steal a fine phrase from Monty Pythons Flying Circus  Anne Francis does a whole lot with a rather thin section of the script and it stands out She was a good choice for the woman of divided loyalties a gal who was rather more modern than the social conventions of that day might have allowed  if there had not been a life and death struggle going on One good aspect of the film is the way the rivalries of the American revolutionary leaders degenerated into outright jealousies and how these personal conflicts very nearly sabotaged the entire revolutionary effort All in all the leading characters are very well drawn the minor characters are not just human props and the fight scenes are believable enough to carry the dramatic action This is a great spy movie Its not quite a great historical drama but it does satisfy well enough It rates a seven largely because Cornel Wilde is so deeply immersed in his role and does it so well and because Anne Francis makes the most of her supporting effort The color print used on Turner Classic Movies was very clear as well and so it was an enjoyable presentation in that important regard Hope it runs again soon
1,Jimmy Wang Yu an authentic Asian superstar directed and wrote this film which I have only seen in a dubbed videotape version The widescreen Shaw Scopeshape was lost and the original actors voices absent but this is still good to watch The story is the usual martial arts school fights villains from Japan plot with our young hero winning out in the end by beating up loads of assorted thugs The combat gets better as the film unravels Early in the film it looks stiff and dull but later there is a great scene where Wang Yu fights hordes in a gambling joint then walks out into a snowy scene and takes some more villains on with knives sword and fists That part is very exciting Quite good then but it would be interesting to see a non dubbed widescreen version if there is one
1,Okay where to begin Did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous mime team Shields and Arnez Bet ya didnt But they turned it down complaining about robot makeup Then they faded off into obscurity Now this movie has everything A crazed killer robot who thinks hes dirty Harry Lots of cool robots Its funny its touching its the perfect date movie for people who love scifi and romantic comedies Its the first robot romantic comedy Now of course very few movies are perfect and there are some character issues But there are very minor and can be overlooked I think couples will enjoy this movie and will want to watch it over and over again 9 STARS
1,DONT TORTURE A DUCKLING Lucio Fulci  Italy 1972 Definitely a prime candidate for the most insane movie title ever conceived and thats quite an achievement in gialloland Originally the film was titled even more absurdly Dont Torture Donald Duck literally translated from its Italian title A small Donald Duck figure features briefly as a toy but hardly enough to render a title like this but apparently it was changed in fear of legal ramifications by Disney I railed quite a bit against Fulcis earlier LIZARD IN A WOMANS SKIN 1971 but here all the right ingredients are present A surprisingly effective mystery a good cast and imaginatively shot against an unusual rural setting Everything just clicks I think its justly hailed as one of the directors most accomplished achievements The story is set against the backdrop of a small mountainside town in Sicily where someone is killing young teenage boys Among the suspects the most obvious one is a young woman Maciara Florinda Balkan a selfproclaimed witch who is seen suspiciously unearthing the skeleton of a baby and sticking pins into way effigies Guiseppe the village idiot is under suspicion as well since he made a feeble attempt to profit from the disappearance of one of the boys and walked right into their trap By the time a quickwitted newshound Tomas Milian arrives from Milan to cover the murders he immediately begins to question the authorities assumptions when he meets two other potential suspects Don Alberto the local priest Marc Porel with a highminded attitude and Patrizia Barbara Bouchet a bored young woman from the city with a troubled past of drug offense who also fancies having sexual relations with the young boys in town Talk about your prime red herring Fulci nicely contrasts modernity and tradition with the newly constructed elevated highway meandering through the Sicilian hills past old towns where life is still firmly rooted in tradition and superstition One could debate about the films political stance as The North versus The South or as commentary on smalltown virtues  societys conventions in general  that are all too often dangerously close to tipping over into moral disintegration chaos and  ultimately  selfjustice by the populace The film has often been lambasted because of its anticatholic tone but its hardly an important element here except for obvious plotrelated reasons which would be giving away too much Its actually rather tame compared to a film like Joël Serias DONT DELIVER US FROM EVIL 1971 Probably the films rather unflattering portrayal of smalltown Sicilian values when another boy is killed the local populace are depicted as a retarded lynchmob might be cause for some offense in Sicily but  considering Sicilys problematic relation with the rest of Italy  hardly problematic for other Italians I would think The film vanquished into obscurity far too quickly to have much impact anyway When talking Fulci the amount of gore is usually a prime subject for discussion Although eyesgouging scenes are lacking the film does contain two very graphic scenes In the grossout finale the killer falls of a cliff smashing his face along the rocks on the way down with gruesome results albeit not very realistic And the chainwhipping sequence with Florinda Balkan in the graveyard shows Fulcis penchant for sadistic violence and typically hes not holding back at graphically showing what most filmmakers would merely hint at Surely one of the most horrifying scenes in Fulcis repertoire  Above all this is a taut wellwritten effective little mystery nicely lensed by Fulci with an impressive cast of genreregulars like Barbara Bouchet Marc Porel not very convincing as a priest Tomas Milian and Florinda Balkan mouthfoamingly crazy as the towns witch Camera Obscura  810
1,Im having as much fun reading the user comments as I did watching the movie It seems that this is the classic either Love it or Hate it movie And I have to say that I not only am on the Love it side Im going on a limb to say it this my FAVORITE movie EVER Thank heavens I found it in the first place Almost IMPOSSIBLE to find I was lucky about ten years ago to record it off a late night UHF channel Of course my liking of Sellers may make me a bit biased but I cant see how anyone with a cornball dry sense of humor like me can not be in love with this flick The plot is great but perhaps as a previous poster said maybe the reason why its not a widely known movie  upset the medical field the acting is great I can see why some may say the acting was horrible  but thats what made this movie so great  its total tackyness and the humor is gut busting Im proud to say I have watched this film no less than about 20 times and have pretty much every line memorized This film is genius
1,This Columbo episode is one of the better and perhaps one of my personal favorites The cast includes Rosemarys Baby John Cassavetes as the maestro his wife played by Blythe Danner Gwyneth Paltrows mom and his motherinlaw played by Myrna Loy one of Americas greatest leading actresses in film of our time Anyway I disagree with anybody who criticizes against this film This episode is one of my favorites because you have an excellent cast who do a superb job in performing I love watching Columbo with his beloved dog who he never names in the series This time the episode focuses in on classical music at the Hollywood Bowl one of LAs attractions Of course Columbo becomes as interested in classical music as he does anything else involving a crime
1,I felt sorry enough that this film is not popular at all even in Hong Kong However for all die hard Chows fan this will be a masterpiece that shud not b left out This is Mo Lei Tou a comedy style that based on unrealistic and ridiculous plot pioneered by Chow at its peak The plot is totally absolutely ultimately 1000 times more ridiculous than any film that u can imagine The dialog is awesome No single part of the film cool down for u to stop laughing The plot look simple but crazy enuf for u to start laughing It begin with Chow starring a junior magistrate a corrupted one of coursecaught into jail when helping an innocent married woman he love at first sight to clear her from a murder charge that plot by evil minister whose son was actually the real convict Chow escape from jail and run away as a refugee He intend to go to the capital to see the Emperor and report the conviction On his way he manage to pick up 2 lovely women one from circus another one a prostitute while in the mean time mastering supreme skill to quarrel and bad mouth from the thin Mamasan who happen to be his future in law Finally he able to force the Emperor to reopen the case by black mail the Emperor whom he meet him in the brothel The Emperor made him a highest level judge to judge the case tgt with the evil minister He manage to setup some brilliant but hilarious plots to force the convict to commit the crime execute him while thrown the evil minister to jail The plots are really hilarious and ridiculously brilliant Also not to forget the tremendous dialog that include some brilliant bad mouth quarrel between Chow and the Mamasan quarrel between the fat Mamasan and thin Mamasan to inspire Chow to learn the quarrel skill later and also quarrel between Chow and the evil eunuch Lee near the ending Beside that some of the scenes are brilliant too One thing that need to mention is that to really understand the film and catch up 100  of all the elements correctly this will be a must to master Cantonese really well Which may be the reason why early age Chow movie receive moderate response only from Asian world However when Chow film began to spread his influence around the globe hardcore fans like me found that his film is no more that funny like the old time
1,by TyNesha Mells In this drama Ja Rule who stars as Reggie struggles with the loss of his father His old friend JBone who is a coldblooded thug recently released from prison helps Reggie find who murdered his father A week after his dad died a preacher Reverend Packer came up dead Reggie was suppose to be the one to kill him but did he Did Reggie kill Reverend Packer or was it some type of a setup Back in the Day also has a couple of romantic scenes See Reggie falls in love with the preachers daughter and JBone doesnt approve of his love fiend As JBone tries to destroy what they have Reggie learns that love is about forgiveness But what Jbone is doing does it work Do Reggie and his girlfriend break up or does it bring them closer together I like this movie because it leaves you wondering whats going to happen next and did this or that happen I like movies with suspense It kind of makes you want to be in the movie so that you could detect things I also like this movie because everything falls in place if you really pay attention to it
1,Father Hood I can understand why a lot of people hate this tale of a father kidnapping his two children and carrying them across America but Ive seen much worse andwhen I saw this years agoI didnt think it was particularly awful Patrick Swayze is the worried father who takes his kids on the run with him for personal reasons and Halle Berry is the cop chasing them down Overall a decent way to spend a couple hours of your life You could certainly do worseever hear of the film Pod People  12 out of  Rated PG13 for some traumatic scenes adult content matter violence and language
1,I must admit this is one of Cameron Diazs unheard of films and i was also surprised that she had an important role but she was not the lead I was very touched by it as i really can identify the pain of the loss of a loved one as i have experienced it from close quarters Both Camilla Belle and Jordana Brewster were really good in their portrayal of the protagonist Phoebe and i must also hand it to the casting people for finding two actresses who look so alike that i really thought they were sistersin real life This is one of those movies Cameron did for the sake of acting and not for star billingShe looked the part of the gorgeous rebellious hippie who wants to change the world though sometimes she comes off as a rebel without a cause Coming from a dysfunctional family where her only source of strength being her big sister Faith little girl Phoebe is understandably very upset when faith leaves for Europe As she grows up she goes off in search of her sister and gradually gets disillusioned by the truth about her sister and falls for her sisters boyfriend Great story and equally great location shooting around EuropeanI will watch it again
1,Wicked Little things was a really good movieI will say at some parts it seemed really unbelievable and others it seemed as if there just wasnt enough thought put into the actions of the characters but overall it was exciting and entertainingI dont understand why this movies rating is so lowNor do I not understand why all the Afterdark Horrorfest films ratings are so lowThese are BMovies people and nothing moreThey provide great entertainment and most of them dont have many flaws at allThis is definitely worth a look because you wont be disappointed with the outcomeWicked Little Things is one of the best 1st Annual Afterdark Horrorfest films and compared to a lot of other films in the series this is one of the best overall
1,One should not be too critical about the directors second feature I really like the camera work of Madiba As Mr Shawn pointed out he had a unique way of looking at things However howcome a 14 year old boy shoot such beautiful images Remember he has not got any education of any sort I dont think english is the common tongue in Cape Town ghettos Worse still Madiba looks even smaller than his supposed age of 14 Any way if you overcome abovementioned peculiarities you can watch the film and still enjoy it because of nice camera work
1,Hey all you jive hustlers you stone foxes you mean dudes Watch out cause Slaughter is back in town If you are looking for a badass funky film to watch some night this is just right Slaughter is back and trying to take it easy n relax after his adventures down in Mexico But if you are a narrowminded gangster like Duncan you are bound to seek revenge Why I dont know Was Hoffo in the first one his brother or what Any who The movie starts off with the old assassination from a plane routine We all know that that is THE most effective way for taking out one guy in a picnic full of people Needless to say Slaughter survives the ordeal but Cmndt Eric Lassard sorry George Gaynes I mean isnt that lucky SMACK Also Slaughters best friend Pratt is killed This is the start of a grand adventure filled with the hippest funkiest music James Brown himself has to offer Thats right The Godfather of Soul has put his trademark up on this badboy In addition to Jim Brown in the lead part this movie is filled with some of the biggest names the blaxploitation scene has to offer How about Scatman Crothers Dick Anthony Williams Gloria Hendry and Brock Peters In other parts we see none other than Judith M Brown and last but definitely least the fantastic Don Stroud as the evil henchman
1,An stunning look at the ocean and the life in it The Good The camera work was absolutely phenomenal Every shot is done beautifully It was interesting seeing all the different animals that I could have never even imagined David Attenborough has the perfect narrators voice No one could have done any better The Bad There were one or two different times where there was a reference to the Earth being 1 million years old  I hold a different belief  Overall a TV series anyone can enjoy I highly recommend buying it 1010 stars
1,Distant is a sliceofTurkishlife flick which follows the mundane activities of two adult male cousins one a photographer and the other an unemployed underachiever Theres little doubt that auteur Nuri Bilge Ceylan is a work in progress with considerable talent However this little foreign minimalistic arty dramady is so full of empty filler and so devoid of story or anything engaging or provocative that it will likely appeal to only the most avid devotees of cinema and mainstream audiences should look elsewhere I personally grew quickly bored with the slow pace of the film and found myself fastforwarding through the empty spaces  and there are many  between dialogue plot development and denouement Distant is a very nicely done bit of esoterica B
1,Police Squad 1982 was a funny show that ended too soon But I guess it had its run before it got too repetitive and unfunny like so many American television shows The geniuses behind this funny show were the team of Zucker Abrahams and Zucker Every since his straight act in the comedy hit AIRPLANE Leslie Nielsen has found a new career as a comedian In this short lived tv series he had the chance to play the straight man in a wacky comedy once more The bizarre titles to each episode gave away the ending But Lt Drebrin Leslie Nielsen got into so many weird cases that they have to be seen to be believed Tooo bad they never released this on DVD If a show needed to be rereleased it would have to be this one A whole new generation is waiting to see this show Highly recommended
1,i saw this film over 20 years ago and still remember how much i loved it it really touched me and i thoroughly enjoyed noel cowards work in it highly recommended atmospheric and touching i think of this film from time to time and am disappointed it hasnt enjoyed as much of a revival as many classic films hadnt realized til i searched for it today that it won an academy award for best original story for ben hecht and charles macarthur basically it involves a nasty character who destroys anothers career and is cursed because of it he dies but is allowed redemption if he can convince someone to shed a tear over him the bulk of the movies shows him in pursuit of this goal well written and lovely i had known him for his plays so i was surprised to see him in this role on TV late one night in new york a must see if you ever have the opportunity
1,If youre a film student or were one or are thinking of becoming one the name Battleship Potemkin has or will have a resonance Sergei Eistenstein like other silentfilm pioneers like Griffith although Eisensteins innovations are not as commonplace as Griffiths and Murnau has had such an impact on the history of cinema its of course taken for granted The reason I bring up the film student part is because at some point whether youd like it or not your film professor 9 times out of 10 will show the Odessa Stairs sequence of this film Its hard to say if its even the best part of the films several sequences dealing with the at the time current times of the Russian revolution But it does leave the most impact and it can be seen in many films showcasing suspense or just plain montage The Untouchables climax comes to mind Montage which was not just Eistensteins knack but also his lifes blood early in his career is often misused in the present cinema or if not misused then in an improper context for the story Sometimes montage is used now as just another device to get from point A to point B Montage was something else for Eisenstein he was trying to communicate in the most direct way that he could the urgency the passions and the ultimate tragedies that were in the Russian people at the time and place Even if one doesnt see all of Eisensteins narrative or traditional story ideas to have much grounding Kubrick has said this one cant deny the power of seeing the ships arriving at the harbor the people on the stairs and the soldiers coming at them every which way with guns Some may find it hard to believe this was done in the 20s it has that power like the Passion of Joan of Arc to overpass its time and remain in importance if only in terms of technique and emotion Of course one could go on for books which have been written hundreds of times over not the least of which by Eisenstein himself On the film in and of itself Battleship Potemkin is really more like a dramatized newsreel than a specific story in a movie The first segment is also one of the great sequences in film as a mutiny is plotted against the Captain and other headups of a certain Ship This is detailed almost in a manipulative way but somehow extremely effective montage is used here as well but in spurts of energy that capture the eye Other times Eisenstein is more content to just let the images speak for themselves as the soldiers grow weary without food and water He isnt one of those directors who will try to get all sides to the story he is of course very much early 20th century Russian but he is nothing else but honest with how he sees his themes and style and that is what wins over in the end Some may want to check it outside of filmschool as the Stairs sequence is like one of those landmarks of severe tragedy on film displaying the ugly side of revolution Eisenstein may not be one of the more accessible silentfilm directors but if montage detail in the frame nonactors and Bolshevik themes are your cup of tea its truly one of the must sees of a lifetime
1,or any stories reminiscent of the Leopold and Loeb case you may find this movie entertaining The cast includes Robert Culpwith Stephen Caffrey and Garrison Hershberger as the college students Peter Falk is his usual self pretending to be tricked by the precocious students Caffrey Longtime Companion Buried Alive is excellent and should do more of these menacing roles Basically the two frat buddies become tired of their demanding parents who expect nothing less than academic perfection attendance at the best schools will only be financed if they conform There is an excellent scene wherein Culp rakes Caffrey over the coals after he gets a low grade threatens to cut off his trust funds and Caffrey later says to his friend I hate him I want him dead All is not well in Beverly Hills This is always an excellent theme I believe this film came out in 1990 right after the Menendez killings If you watch Menedez a Killing in Beverly Hills and then compare it to this film you may find some interesting parallels
1,Growing up in the late 60s and 70s I could not help but become a fan of science fiction With Americas space program in top gear scifi books movies TV shows and comic books fueled my imagination and opened my mind to the possibilities that exist in the universe Farscape is so unlike any other scifi show yet it has all the ingredients that made shows like Star Trek Battlestar Gallatica XFiles and Deep Space Nine personal favorites One of the criticisms of Farscape is that the casual viewer cant just jump in and watch one episode and understand what is going on There have been other very successful shows that used multiple episode story arcs and complicated characters This for me is one of the charms of the show I dont need or want to have the story all tied up neatly at the end of every episode like the various incarnations of Star Trek have done All in all Farscape has wonderful and funny characters and a running storyline that says that although humans may be the least evolved or advanced intelligent species in the universe they still have unique qualities and abilities Unfortunately the shortsighted people at the SciFi channel have canceled Farscapes 5th season They have stated that the cancellation was based on sagging ratings Yet just a few years ago it was their top rated original series and a critical favorite Its a shame that all of the artists who help create this show will be unable to continue their labor of love because of the fiscal problems of the very channelcompany that made it all possible in the first place Hey dont take my word for it watch the show watch the reruns and make up your own mind Help save Farscape
1,Oh my GOD  I can truly say that Maya Angelou is one of the worlds most intriguing and important people especially of my culture She is incredibly inspiring and her story is the story of a great woman  When I first picked this movie up I thought to myself the cast was wonderfully put together now lets see them in action  Maya Angelou is already my favorite PoetEss and now one of my favorite actresses and speakers I believe she is the greatest of all time This movie had me on the edge of my seat and reaching for Kleenex while at the same time reminding me that no matter where you come from if you decide that you are going to be great then you will be great  And Ester Rolle played a wonderful supporting role 100 AWESOMEand now even I know Why the Caged Bird Sings
1,I love the absurdity and biting humor of Buñuels surrealist films such as The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie and The Exterminating Angel to name two Other earlier works like The Forgotten Ones about juvenile delinquents from a marginal neighborhood in Mexico are more serious and provide a strong social message However I believe it is Nazarin which most successfully shoots for the heart of the viewer While its true that its brimming with irony it nevertheless reveals an aspect of Buñuel which would appear to be intrigued by the beauty and solemnity of the spiritual quest Here while the director quite typically throws countless jabs at the Catholic Church he also appears to show surprisingly a sense of admiration for genuine Christian thought and its practice of selfless love What Luis Buñuel unabashedly praising a Jesuslike figure I always thought of him as a completely cynical artist without a trace of faith in human virtue that is until I watched Nazarin My appreciation is that he satirically exposes the difficulty of following Christs example in a society infested with meanness ignorance and sin but he also presents the hero Father Nazario as quite the beacon of light amidst a sea of darkness Without a doubt by the end of the film I was looking up to him and not down on him  Some would argue that Father Nazarios doubts regarding his faith point to the loss of his saintly values Alas if he cant do good in this world who can But I would say that this flaw his frustration precisely makes his character all the more heroic because it shows how human he is and how challenging his struggle within must be And who says the priest couldnt eventually emerge from that dark night and regain his confidence Perhaps weve only been presented with a difficult part of his spiritual journey The elegant open ending in which he desperately accepts the fruit offered by a female stranger allows us to imagine ourselves the final outcome of the story I recognize in Buñuel the aggressive selfprofessed atheist endowed with brilliant wit and social consciousness but after having watched Nazarin I also sense from him a certain warmth a depth and maturity thats not so evident in his other work For the sake of contrast I strongly recommend watching afterward his short film Simon of the Desert also made in Mexico several years later It deals with a similar subject matter  the abandonment of the ego in the face of temptation  only it does so in a hysterically funny and totally irreverent style
1,I just wanted to write a quick response to all those people who give this film a bad review because they think it isnt funny or that its boring  Heres the trick  the film is not meant to be just a comedy Its got some depth to it Like many Demme films it deals with people living in some of the odd corners of our society who are trying to work out how to put together a fulfilling life for themselves  Unfortunately the movie and home video industries dont deal well with subtlety and drop this in the COMEDY bin It IS funny but a lot of the humor is offbeat However the heart of the movie is not about the humor but about the people in it It may not be one of the greatest films in the world but it is solid and entertaining  And the cast is one of those that shows why casting is an art unto itself Michelle Pfieffer is great and this may be the film that showed she had some acting chops to add to her beauty Mercedes Ruehl is a big hoot and gets to chew the scenery in the way only she can in a role which requires it Throw in Oliver Platt Joan Cusack in smaller roles and the talented Dean Stockwell  and even Chris Isaak and youve got a great cast throughout which here as usual makes a great difference Matthew Modine is fun but more important hes a major hottie in this movie Hot cute and sexy Sit back expect the unexpected and let the movie take you where it wants to go and you should have a great time
1,Richard Schickels 1991 documentary about Gary Cooper  Gary Cooper American Life American Legend gives us a look at the tremendous allAmerican star through his films and his life Narrated by Clint Eastwood the theme is definitely Gary Coooper American as we are taken through fast clips of his many appearances in westerns and scenes from Meet John Doe Mr Deeds Goes to Town and Sgt York The best part of the documentary is the home movies of Cooper and his family as well as his childhood photos showing him as a beautiful blonde kid with the sunny smile he would have his entire life There is also a hilarious clip of Cooper on The Jack Benny Show doing the comeback on the number Bird Dog  and Benny loses it The documentary also takes us briefly through his tumultuous affair with Patricia Neal which nearly ruined both their lives Theres a certain cohesiveness missing from this bioretrospective  it jumps around a lot and has no footage of Cooper being interviewed which would have added a lot Also Clint Eastwoods narration was described as unobtrusive What it was was boring and monotone Given that Cooper himself tended to be the strong silent type on screen we could have used a little animation On a personal note Gary Cooper was one of the handsomest men who ever lived  there were some looks at him in his early films but not nearly enough for this fan That smile those lips that bone structure  he was handsome throughout his life but in films like Morocco and Desire he is devastating Instead of sitting through a scene from one of his worst performances as Howard Roark in The Fountainhead giving a speech that he admitted to the author he did not understand  a young suave Cooper in a tux would have been a nice touch This documentary alas was definitely produced by a man
1,I usually give horror films around 610 but this one caught my eye House of Wax was by far the best horror film I have seen Even better than the Amityville Horror Paris Hilton was quite good in this and I must say has a good future ahead Her death scene was probably the coolest Ill just say how she dies She gets a giant pole right between her eyes and they closeups on and everything Gory eh Brian Van Holt was very good as both the killers Bo and Vincent Vincent had the long hair Usually he plays a mean cop or soldier but he did very well in this Eliza Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray also acted very well as Carly and Nick Jones Nick took the spotlight in the first half of the movie then Eliza stole it back by enduring a lot of pain in the second half like getting the finger clipped off ripping her lips apart after they got glued together and getting a straight forward punch in the face by Bo Overall I give this movie an 810 Fans of horror films MUST see this
1,This was the first Mickey Mouse cartoon released and the first cartoon with sound It was based on a silent movie called Steamboat Bill Jr starring Buster Keaton Back in this early Mickey short Mickey did not talk nor did he have gloves He could just whistle and play music The song that he played was Turkey in the Straw using several barnyard animals as musical instruments He plays a cows teeth as a xylophone and he plays a nursing sows teats like an accordion keyboard Captain Pete however is very mad and makes Mickey peel potatoes in the galley Petes parrot flies up to the window and orders him to peel the potatoes Mickey throws a halfpeeled potato at the parrot and laughs thus closing the cartoon I was able to get this cartoon on tape and I really like it I think the Disney shorts are much better than the feature length movies
1,Rush in Rio is simply an amazing DVD This concert is one of the peak moments of the history of Rush and they deliver their music brilliantly and with more power than ever I was lucky enough to actually be in this concert and not only that I was in the very first row grabbing the gate that separated the audience from the stage Its the first and only time Ive seen a Rush concert live and it was a dream come true for me I have no words to accurately describe this experience but I can tell you it is one of the highlights of my life Some people complain about the sound of this DVD saying it is not very clear and polished but the sound you listen is real true to how it was in the concert It is raw and powerful and so authentic that every time I watch it I go back and relive that beautiful moment Many artists record live shows and then they make a lot of tweaking so the final product is far from what the actual concert really was Sure you can achieve a very sophisticated and polished sound this way but you dont get the real thing This is not the case with Rush in Rio this is the real deal I admit that I enjoy those fancy sounding concert DVDs I love music and the sound is a very important aspect but its refreshing to listen to a concert that is so honest You listen to Rush just the way they sound in a live performance no tricks no tweaks This is a real live concert DVD I highly recommend Rush in Rio the setlist is fantastic and the performances by Geddy Alex and Neil are mindblowing Not to mention the crowd you can see how much they love Rush and sing along to every tune even YYZ which is an instrumental I actually appear singing twice in Tom Sawyer I sing always hopeful yet discontent and in Earthshine I sing only reflect Its just a few seconds but I simply couldnt believe my eyes when I saw myself in a rush DVD Awesome I hope you enjoy this magnificent concert from the greatest band on Earth
1,Focus is an engaging story told in urban WWIIera setting William Macy portrays everyman who is taken out of his personal circumstances and challenged with decisions testing his values affecting the community Laura Dern Macy and David Paymer give good performances so also the good supporting ensemble
1,I saw this film on the AE channel this past weekend The mystery was okay I was not able to guess the culprit before the end But I enjoyed the characters and their development much more than the mystery There was a mystery about some of them especially George Abernathie performed by the wonderful Michael Fassbender and Georges cousin Susannah In fact the story of those two characters left me wanting to know more From what Ive tried to glee about the Agatha Christie book of the same title I think this film did not follow it to the letter Very good performances by the actors involved especially Fassbender and the lady who played Coracompanion
1,I love this movie it can make me laugh  Which is kinda hard to do This movie is one of the best cartoon adaptations ever It doesnt warp the characters like other movies out there Everyone is in character and has a role to play The movie focuses around Buster and Babs going down river after a flood courtesy of Buster to Plucky going on a trip with Hamton hilarious stuff Elmyra running around torturing animals as usual Fifi following her crush around for an autograph and Shirley and Fowlmouth going to the movies In my own personal opinion I didnt like the Buster and Babs segments that much although they had some notable dialogue and jokes I have got to say the Plucky and Hampton Vacation parts were the best Hamtons family is HILARIOUS I especially like Uncle Stinky Fifi in the hotel was also hilarious I love the actor cameos during this scene D Probably the most famous part in this movie again IMHO is when Fowlmouth and Shirley are in the movie theater LOL Youve got to see it to appreciate it And when Hamton and Plucky go through the tunnel to make a wish  Although this movie moved slowly during the BusterBabs parts the rest is pure gold I rate this movie 810 Show this to your kids one day or even adults yourselves  WATCH THIS MOVIE You wont regret it
1,This is an extraordinary film musically It made me feel awful that Rodrigues died in 1999 before I had a chance to see her live To know that she performed a marvelous Lincoln Ctr concert in 1991  that I mightve been there but wasnt is painful beyond words I just purchased my first Amalia recording While the musical recording is fantastic being able in this film to SEE her face  its tremendous expressiveness  passion as she sings these songs of terrible sadness is wonderful Sort of like seeing the face of Mary as she cradles Jesus in her arms in the Pieta Watching her on film reminded me of being witness to a similar extraordinary concert performance by Mercedes Sosa in the mid 1990s at Lincoln Ctr As I sat listening to Mercedes sing I felt I was in the presence of a tremendous spiritual  musical force that contained awesome primal power Some of The Art of Amalias musical segments are touching such as Caetano Veloso paying tribute to Amalia  singing one of her songs solo in front of a packed concert hall The musical segments also convey the incredible international sweep of her musical repertoire  the bonds she created w fans throughout the entire world There is one segment in which she claims that she has played in every single town in Italy that has a stage In another section Amalia talks about her bout w mouth cancer  how she came to NYC to commit suicide in a hotel Yet through watching Fred Astaire film videos she gradually persuaded herself that life was worth living  turned away from killing herself Amazing Later in the film she quite bravely  directly admits to the interviewer that though she mightve conquered the world musically her personal life was one of pure sadness She admits that she has never been happy This is unbearably sad to hear but perfectly in keeping w a singer steeped in the fado which she translates as bad destiny or bad luck tradition Also one longs to hear more about her personal life what was in that made her so sad what were her disappointments The Art of Amalia is a little disappointing in other major areas My quibbles to show 2030 full songs in the film yet to only provide an English translation for the very last one seems a waste unless the film was only intended for a Portuguese speaking audience which I cant imagine To see the profound pain on her face as she sings  not to understand the lyrics is a let down As for the other minuses there is almost no biographical material about Amalias family background There is one 20 sec snippet w her singing w her mother its absolutely grand There is one short reference to her parents moving fr the countryside to Lisbon I wouldve loved to see film footage of the village she came from The interviews such as they are are almost solely w Amalia herself  a few close friends She is a good but not great subject There are no interview subjects who are experts on fado or Portuguese culture  society so we get no depth of understanding of her musical roots In short this is a wonderful film that everyone interested in Amalia should see But its not a perfect or definitive work on the subject
1,A gentle story hinting at fury with a redemptive message and glorious celebration The photography is wondrously well executed Cinematographers look at this kind of film to hone their craft not just for what the eye can do to enhance a story but what the right camera vocabulary can do to heighten an emotion Feeding the soul is by definition what this movie addresses but with an elegance and grace of delivery that simply doesnt not happen much anymore at least with this degree of taste restraint and finesse If you care about story and character development this is a also a great movie to see as an example of what simple lines and the right delivery can do to completely fill out a characters impression Match all this with a film score that is almost minimalist in character and also perfectly conceived and youll get this movie
1,Unlike most people whove commented I was born after the last Sylvester Mccoy Episode and so couldnt have compared the two centuries of doctor who at first I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series I have since then seen old episodes of Doctor Who and some where great but like the doctor the series needed to regenerate to continue The 21st century doctor whos are great I thought Martha was great almost a match for the doctor and if Jacks appearance is anything to go by shes going to be brilliant when she cameos in series 4 or 5 Speaking of Jack the spin of Torchwood is also brilliant and you should watch both of these programmes though this is definitely more suitable for kids However if you insist that this isnt the same and just isnt Doctor Who please just stay in your basement 1010
1,These critics need to find a new job This movie is based on a TRUE STORY which has made history It illustrates beautifully how even in the mist of war and tragedy love can conquer all The breathtaking Chephallonia of Greece has captured my heart and soul as if I too were there The Blue eyed Cage  the delightful Cruz were amazing Together they perfectly portrayed how a Mediterranean couple can only become closer in the time of war This movie will touch your heart like it did mine you must go see it
1,John Barrymore plays a gentleman who is also the thief Arsene Lupin While no one knows for sure this is the case the inspector Lionel Barrymore is sure of it but cannot prove it So Lionel spends much of the movie following Johnhoping to catch this brilliant and slippery thief Although I liked the film I really think I had higher expectations for it and thought it might be better than just a very good timepasser Thats because it paired John AND Lionel Barrymore in the film and since these brothers were such dynamic actors I think I expected sparks and magic but instead only caught glimpses of it here and there Now this is not to say this is a bad filmit certainly isnt It just didnt rise to the level of being unforgettable or a film I strongly recommend you see Thanks an adequate script the film is pretty good but I was surprised to hear no French accents at all in the film even though it was supposedly about French people Also there just wasnt much life in the film until it was nearly complete The ending was indeed excellent and entertainingso good that it elevated the film from a 6 to a 7 Its nice to see it ended on a high note
1,I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before seeing this film I had just seen the MOOG doc which was alright the only problem was Moog led a very content life and the doc was well content Haacks story is filled with all the marketable tragedy people buy into these days but it carries a great deal of heart with it Though the film doesnt go into the tragic stuff so much one can sense that Bruce accepted the price of making music his way There are so many elements that make up his legacy IE invention of the Peopleodian where Bruce could actually play music by touching people It must have been challenging to document Haacks scatterbrained output which pretty much fell into every musical category imaginable even rap music but the director cut the piece together very coherently and managed to capture the spirit And the cast what a group of characters Bruce surrounded himself with but what do you expect from a telepathic guru tripping with kids fighting against the music industry I recommend this film to anyone interested in music history its that mainstream but that important
1,I didnt know much about this movie going in my roommate kind of dragged me into it I was so pleasantly surprised The plot really grabbed my attention and held it and the characters are welldrawn and realistic The screenplay is very clever and funny and the cast does great things with it And the best part is that it managed to be entertaining without any explicit sex or violence If this movie comes anywhere into your area you really should go see it stand up for this little film it is worth it
1,We open in a doctors room of some sort A girl is escorted to a seat across from the doctor He asks her questions Silence follows He continues to ask questions ignoring the girls obvious traumatised atmosphere The story is about two girls who are taken home after spending some time in a mental home after an incident that happened before hand They are greeted on their arrival by their tryingwaytoohardtobenicebutsototallyevil Stepmother who the girls obviously hold resentment for As time goes on at home the evil Stepmother finds new ways to torment the girls And to top it all off there is a vengeful ghost that is far from helping the girls recovery This film is amazing It has twist turns and definitely leaves you a lot to think about without not making sense The relationship between the two girls is so heartwarming it almost makes you cry at some points I know I had a teary moment of two specifically the cupboard scene But what I love most about this film is the total feeling of dread all the way through to the rolling credits The soundtrack is faultless the furnishings in the house and the use of colour are fantastic A pure joy for the eyes This is a definite mustsee for all Asian Movie Fanatics Or ANY sort of movie fan An easy 1010
1,Having just watched this with my mother Who got it for Christmas i was thrilled to find something different to the usual stuff i usually watch All of the stories were detailed and you are able to feel strong emotion towards each character from the very beginning Every storyline is followed through brilliantly making you feel completely different things for every single character The cast is amazing my personal favourites being James Read and LesleyAnne Down as George Hazard and Madeline FabrayLaMotteMain The whole thing is in depth and wonderful making very compulsive viewing i recommend it to almost everyone
1,Rififi directed by Jules Dassin is in line with the Melville crime pictures particularly Bob le Flameur and to a point Le Cercle Rouge of being totally focused on story and character and making sure not a word is spoken that doesnt need and was ahead of its time Ionically it still has a kind of professionalism among its characters a kind of respect if not for selves than for others a kind of duty that rings well in postWW2 France Its actors carry faces for these characters that say we know what these guys are about and from there the story takes off Maybe its because I have a weak spot for heist pictures particularly where we see just the nuts and bolts err actual physical side of how a heist is pulled off One of the problems with how the actual heist is filmed in todays movies is that its all very fast ie Snatch or done in ways weve seen too many times before Dassin like Melville years later decided to create practically a silent film of a heist sound effects included The tension that builds up in this scene may not top what Melville had in Rouge but on its own level it achieves its own greatness and momentum and just as crucial originality to whats been done before There are some kept closeups for example as the safe is being cracked that mark some of the best Ive seen from France at that time An added plus for the film aside from the larvalstage newwave touch to the film which in the end makes it a little more modern is that the story works so well and differently It becomes completely about character at points and then keeps up the thrills The last ten to fifteen minutes are downright miraculous like with another classic heist picture the Asphalt Jungle its not even the last stop that matters but all about how much one will go past the call of duty putting humanism over greed You almost wonder in all the exhilaration of the camera flying by the trees at a high speed with the car that he might just make it Dassin has here a very entertaining and intuitive film of its genre with a nifty little musical number as well
1,Like classic Hollywood musicals the plot is just an excuse A must see for those interested in French music hall including a song by Édith Piaf and for the wonderful 10 plus minute cancan finale The dancing in the film is not at all like what usually passes for cancan Some might object to the Technicolor costumes and the bright lighting but it gives you a clear view of some grand costumes and sets Consider it Jean Renoirs love letter to the Paris he grew up in Certainly the Jean Renoir film for people who dont like his serious films or who only like his Hollywood productions 
1,Having watched the show for about four weeks which is enough to get a feel for the show I think it shows potential Whilst much is borrowed from other shows what scifi doesnt these days and the characters are stereotyped I like what they are doing with the stories There is some continuity with plot development and character interactionrelationship building despite the essentially modular nature of each episode There have been some science related topics explored as well as character secretweakness revelations These have also added some comedy to the show something I would gladly see more of in serious scifi In all this makes for good balance such that can appeal to larger groups of people unlike the Star Trek vs Babylon 5 debates Ive been numerous participant and witness to The visual aspects of the show are more than adequate and well budgeted for a first season The acting is acceptable and I am curious to see how well the actors manage to grow their characters out of their scripted stereotypes I see enough positives and potential to remain interested in seeing where the show wants to go
1,This is one of the best episodes from the entire XFiles series creepy beyond words The tension and suspense in this episode is very well executed in its entire 45 minutes it managed to be almost as scary as an entire movie This episode joins the ranks of best episodes with such greats as Home Humbug Bad Blood and Milagro for being the best in their respective season Mulder and Scullys growing relationship is put to the test in this episode Can they really trust each other This episode also contains a tiny scene that will leave romantic viewers smiling Mulder Bring your mittens
1,Barbara Stanwyck probably didnt think of it but it is a relief to see her in a more becoming dark hairstyle if it wasnt a wig than the one she had to wear in Double Indemnity the year before That film while the premiere film noir and an allaround great film gave her a great role but oh that hair Here she is more chic and certainly no femme fatal but she is certainly a 40s woman She has gotten used to life without men since most of them are off at war and as a successful Martha Stewart like columnist she writes a homey column in which she describes her country home as the camera pans over what it really is We meet her boss Sydney Greenstreet who has no idea that she is living a lie and when he pushes his way in for a Christmas away at her supposed Connecticut home she has to come up with a husband Reginald Gardiner and baby before we can say Jingle Bells Hungarian chef SZ Sakall steps in to help and ends up in a cutsey pie oneonone with Irish Una OConnor Its not Goulash Its Irish Stew Sakall simply takes the paprika pours most of it in and says Now its goulash totally changing what she has prepared for lunch Then when it comes to the flapjacks he flips and she scoops For years a few friends of mine and I will use that line every time pancakes come up in a conversation I dont flip I scoop She wont even flip just one for Greenstreet saying Ive never flipped in me life OConnor can get on the nerves when she screeches over and over in some films but here she is delightfully lovable and her pairing with Sakall is very charming It is obvious in the romance department that Reginald Gardiner is not Barbara Stanwycks cup of tea especially when she meets handsome Dennis Morgan who is a bit dimwitted when bathing the baby which eats soap causing Stanwyck to get a bit alarmed He should suspect something instantly but doesnt But it doesnt matter The film is so charming with the country setting filled with snow an abundance of rocking chairs and a dog running towards them as the sleigh comes up Living in New York City after 25 years in Los Angeles after growing up in a small town on the western side of New York State made me miss this kind of Christmas While Central Park is beautiful after a first snow and the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center is exsquisit too there is something about looking out at a snowcovered field of trees and catch an occasional glimpse of deer rabbits or other wild life This is a great holiday film that can also bring on the Christmas spirit out of season and makes a great pairing with another Barbara Stanwyck country Christmas film Remember the Night an underrated gem Add on the big city Christmas of Meet John Doe and youve found perhaps one of the busiest stars of holiday films around
1,Errol Flynns roguish charm really shines through in this entertaining and exciting but historically bankrupt biopic of the famous and some would say infamous General Custer that follows his career from his first day at West Point through the Civil War and out west to the battle at The Little Big Horn all the while butting heads with rival Arthur Kennedy and romancing pretty Olivia de Havilland Some might say that Flynn who delivers a great flamboyant performance as the general is basically playing himself playing Custer A lavish production that should have been in Technicolor well directed by Raoul Walsh They Died With Their Boots On features some truly wellstaged battle sequences Also its a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse The previous year Flynn played Jeb Stuart opposite Ronald Reagans George Custer in Santa Fe Trail also with de Havilland another actionpacked Warner Brothers production designed to make you fail history class
1, eXistenZ is simply David Cronenbergs best movie All the people compare it to the Matrix Theyre not even similar If you enjoyed Cronenbergs other works just a little bit youll love this one
1,How to summarize this film  it is simply impossible Why you should see it  maybe for the story very probably for the actors Giorgio Catherine above all for the universe and the poetry This is a tale Sad sometimes dark but a tale I LOVE this film  Just waiting for the DVD  Thank you mister Boutonnat
1,I love this movie a lot I must get this on DVD I have 2 VHS copies but the quality is so poor that you cant read one written joke over the door of the ward Im forever amazed that Blankfield did almost nothing afterward He made both Dr Jeckle and Mr Hyde totally believable The movie is plagued by its low budget One atrocious edit jumps into midword and was described on Siskel  Ebert But there are a thousand jokes sight gags to subtle references that more than compensate I often find myself quoting lines or singing Ive Got Nothing to Hide and from time to time completely describe a scene which matches some conversation There are at least six scenes which are among my all time favorite comedy bits Viewers with no history of cocaine use may miss a lot of gags Here take it  Visual of driving while waving butt out the window I said Is this seat taken Nice Burn Visual of chaps headdress jockstrap  swim fins  Yeah Im right handed  Me Me says the woman trying to sell nads  Bernies going to love these  Thats my feet Jack says the black feet  Why should we tell you SHES AT THE SUPERMARKET  Ivy on supermarket PA  Loading whole shopping cart into ambulance  etc
1,Medusa Dare to be Truthful is an outrageously funny parody that is a fine companion to the original Madonna Truth or Dare Julie Browns brilliant creation skewers Madonnas highly entertaining documentary although it wasnt exactly daring insightful candid or truthful with a faithfulness to detail right down to the packaging I highly recommend this for Madonna fans Julie Brown fans or anyone who enjoys sharp and clever parody
1,First of all  Im not one to go all sappy over movies I saw Friends in the 70s when it was first released I was about 17 years old at the time Even now at age 50 I still can remember some of the scenes The movie is sweet and sad and may actually be too tame for teenagers today but I loved it The story is about innocence the purity of young love and the determination of 2 young people to make a better life for themselves then they had at home At the time it was pretty risky to have a movie about a couple of young runaways who successfully setup house and have a baby on their own Im not surprised the movie and Elton Johns soundtrack are almost unknown today The music is beautiful It was unforgettable
1,It was Libby talking to Desmond in the flashback and if anyone is confused about her past like how did she end up in the same hospital Hurley was in then you should know that despited Libby dying in season 2 the character will be explored more in season 3 and we will get answers to questions surrounding her BTW great episode It had a really great cliffhanger and some interesting questionslike what happened to Eko and Lock and what about the four toe statue I cannot wait till season 3 Lost just rules I hope all the unanswered questions will be answered I loved how they explained why the plane actually crashed Desmond did it when he did not manage to type in the numbers in time 4 8 15 16 23 42
1,The story of an obsessed lover Shahrukh Khan and the lengths he goes to get his true love Juhi Chawla whos already married to her husband Sunny Deol The film is considered one of Shahrukh Khans best performances and won him acclaim from critics and audiences alike Fear that your love may not be reciprocated fear that you may lose the one you love fear that your beloved could have a change of heart In short fear is the villain in every love story But in Darr fear is the ultimate expression of passion of obsession and of sacrifice Darr is Rahuls Shahrukh Khan story whose love and obsession for Kiran Juhi Chawla frees him from all fears of life  death Darr is Sunils Sunny Deol story whose enduring love and passion for Kiran gives him the courage to face the fear of death And finally Darr is Kirans story who is caught between one mans love and another mans obsession She fears one  fears for the other One stands for love the other for life In this battle between love  life the supreme victor is love because love always wins in life  death simply Darr is one of the best Indian films ever made
1,If you have ever seen a Bollywood movie you know they are longer than most movies due to the multiple song and dance routines each one is over five minutes long Fortunately this one has fewer song and dance routines and fits into the standard movie length Dont get me wrong I like Bollywood movies but tend to fast forward through the song and dance portions I bought this DVD because I am an Ian Bohen fan Although his role wasnt as large as I hoped he still had a good amount of screen time And his character was much different than his other roles Overall this was a good movie Like most Bollywood movies there is at least one element of controversyconflict of the traditional Indian culture But true love triumphs over adversity and a happy ending is had by all
1,I took my younger niece to an early showing and she LOVED it I enjoyed it myself as well I dont need to explain the plot since the movie remains completely true to the awardwinning topselling book by famed author Carl Hiaasen The movie takes the popular book and layers it with beautiful cinematography I want to go to Florida now humor thanks to funnyman Luke Wilson and some newcomers and Great music I have to get to get a Jimmy Buffet CD now I know a movie is good when I get goosebumps in the end Overall it was great family film that I felt comfortable taking my younger niece to Id recommend it to any and everyone
1,Some martialarts purists think that comedy was the worst thing that could have happened to the oldschool kungfu flick and it is true that the introduction of comedy into the genre signaled the end of the chopsocky period in Hong Kong film But the fact is one can only carryon a primarily physical exhibition of prowess for just so long then everyone gets bored with it And thats really why the chopsocky died and how the Hong Kong New Wave action film was born the producers the actors the directors all just got bored with hitting people for ninetyminutes straight Given that and given the fact that Liu Chia Liang is a professional director with a considerable list of films in his resume this film has to be seen as something other than just another kungfu comedy Rather it is a comic film within the martialarts genre and in fact one of the best ever made What Liu has done with this film is really a pleasant surprise he has taken a martialarts plot and reconstructed it along the lines of a Hollywoodstyle musical Complete with episodes of singing and dancing It was around the time of the making of this film that some filmmakers and film fans began to recognize that the cinematic performance of martialarts really derived from the acrobatics of the Chinese opera has more in common with dance than with fighting I will continue to point out this connection until most Americans realize what they are actually supposed to look for when watching a martial arts film  wellchoreographed body movements using the plot of an action film as an excuse for their performance At any rate quite clearly Liu Chia Liang made this connection and decided he would explore it close to its limits The result is an incredibly charming entertainment filled with marvelously human characters attempting miraculous kungfu and tripping over their own shoelaces as often as not when they do so and the film being set at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries allows Liu the opportunity to explore the nature of the Westernization and Modernization of China that contributed so greatly to the making of the China we know today So the film has considerable historical import as well Also fans of Stephen Chows recent Kung Fu Hustle should really watch this movie carefully as Chow clearly learned from it before the making of his own film A very amusing wellmade film Oh yes and the kung fu in it is really really good Purists wont admit it but this is probably director Lius best film
1,Heres another entertaining Clint Eastwood actionsuspense film I am not a particularly fan of his but I have to hand to him he knows how to make entertaining movies This is one more example It didnt hurt either to have John Malkovich as his costar Now there is an intense actor In this story Malkovich plays an assassin and he is fascinating to watch thanks to his different disguises and the terrific dialog he was given He also has a interesting voice Rene Russo is fairly lowkey for her but thats fine and Eastwood plays the usual lonercop role not appreciated by his superiors but showing them all up in the end I guess he couldnt stop playing the Dirty Harrytype figures but he played them well There were some negatives this film however namely credibility in parts as there were a couple of times had this been reallife the killer would have done away with Eastwood The climatic scene in particularly had too many holes in it There also were too many abuses of Lords name in vain in here Overall however this is good escapist fare
1,I will never forget the utterly absorbing effect this show had on me when I saw it for the first time From the moment that the Major is startled by the Clown to his anguished attempts to make sense of the situation   Were alive were people we must have memories inexact quote but close to his clever attempt to improvise a means of escape this is riveting drama Little touches stay with the viewer for a long time after watching it The moment when the lovely ballerina dances for everyone to the off key screeching bagpipes of the Scottish musician the Tramps wistful remark  A miss is as good as a mile the Majors shaken conclusion that they must be in Hell This is a brilliant episode beautifully written and acted The breathtaking beauty of Susan Harrison adds to the memorability of the strange touching story
1,Destined to be a classic before it was even conceptualized This game deserves all the recognition it deserves At a time when firstperson shooters like Quake III Arena and Unreal Tournament are garnering all the attention of computer gamers graphic adventures are a dying breed With great pun and humour The Curse of Monkey Island is a game that people of all age groups would enjoy Life can only improve after playing The Curse of Monkey Island prediction the sequel Escape from Monkey Island is already destined to be a classic too I guarantee it
1,Reading the other comments here at the IMDB I had very high expectations before seeing Angels of the universe I wasnt disappointed and giving the movie an 8 I would say that I can justify that grade The movie has some incredible acting especially by the mainperson Pall The supporting actors are also doing a very good job like the patients in the mental institution the parents and the siblings of Pall The music is also worth mentioning supporting the movie throughout giving depth and feeling Although the movie is very scandinavian it doesnt leave out some humour and has a sort of objective authorship about Palls life Still if you want to see a cheesy comedy or something lightweight this is not for you It is a story about people with mental problems about the way they are being dealt with in society  but most of all a story about Pall I recommend this movie to all movie connoisseurs It is one of the best movies that has ever come out of Iceland if not out of Scandinavia
1,Darr although a copy of some Hollywood flick is one of the best films I have seen It is not only beautifully portrayed but also has great songs and beautiful scenery Shahrukh is his usual self His expressions and voice matches his character I was pleasantly surprised by Sunny Deols portrayal in the film He is a bit romantic and lovable in the film unlike his other characters in his other filmsAt times you feel like Justice hasnt been done to his character Sunny was intended to be portrayed as the good guy in the film but ends up looking like the villain at the end Juhi Chawla is beautiful and bubbly She is her usual self In short A great love story with passion
1,Its rare for a film to sweep you away within its world and leave you wanting more once the credits roll Hayao Miyazakis Ponyo is such a film The film is the story of a young goldfish named Ponyo who wishes to become human She swims to shore and is found by a young boy named Sasuke who promises to take care of her Course Ponyos father an ecologically obsessed sorcerer named Fujimoto tries to keep Ponyo from becoming human in order to maintain the balance of nature which is eventually upturned when Ponyo finally transforms into a little girl causing a massive typhoon Ponyo is a very rich film It is full of wondrous fantasy lovable characters and genuine heart What director Hayao Miyazaki has done here is tell a simple little story and while so doing creating authentic movie magic Ponyo is an enchanting experience The love between Sasuke and Ponyo is very pure and true As well the environmentalist within Miyazaki is still as evident within this film as in all his previous works Miyazaki shows the filth and grime that fall into the ocean in an almost startling light not to mention Ponyos father is on an obsessive mission to clean the worlds oceans While the story is simple Miyazaki manages to add this extra layer to provoke thought with expert proficiency The film is a beautiful work of art each hand drawn cell looks like a wondrous pastel painting The film looks very different than many other Studio Ghibli productions but the artistry is still just as spectacular as ever before The scenes underwater are simply beautiful to watch Fujimotos fortress under the sea is highly inventive and the sequence where Ponyo runs across the jumping fish within the typhoon to reach Sosuke is iconic Course it is thanks to its wonderfully executed characters that makes this film such a memorable experience Sosuke is a young boy who acts older than he actually is and the energetic Ponyo is a laugh a minute Every character is just so enjoyable and highly memorable Overall Ponyo is a wondrous experience enchanting in every single way While the film may be sold as a childrens fairy tale I believe many adults will be swept away within its fantastic world along with their children While the film may lack the density of some of Miyazakis previous works here he keeps it pure and simple being true to himself delivering a film that is funny heartwarming and entertaining all in one This is a magnificent film I give Ponyo a perfect 10 out of 10
1,I described Woody Allens Manhattan as perfect to someone the other day and she thought that it was an odd way to describe a movie I have seen only a handful of movies that I would call perfect Manhattan is one McCabe  Ms Miller by Robert Altman is another and Once Upon a Time in the West by Sergio Leone is also another film that I think achieves perfection There are a few others but aside from the fact that I find no faults in the three I mentioned I must also admit that all three directors are acquired tastes If there is one film that I could stand behind and bet the house that anyone I would show it to would find it flawless its Shoulder Arms City Lights The Great Dictator The Gold Rush and even the Pawnshop are 10s but not only did Chaplin do everything right in this film everything he did is hilarious and touching to a level beyond explanation
1,Its Showtime Showtime is simply a bump in Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiros careers Its an entertaining movie and a guilty pleasure but not quite up to the actors standards especially not Roberts Showtime is directed by Tom Dey and features some small roles from guys like William Shatner and Mos Def Showtime is about two very different cops Mitch Preston DeNiro and Trey Sellars Murphy One takes work seriously in a low profile quiet manner while the other is more easygoing and wants to have more fun than felons in his back seat They are both after the same felons behind a huge caper of televisions VCRs etc They then cross paths and a TV station wants a new reality TV show so they fight crime while they are on TV Mitch hates the publicity while Trey loves it with his line Its Showtime Their TV antics and methods are shown on TV and they are the new Cops show The fun begins Overall Showtime is a fun action comedy A good film but not quite up to the actors expectations and standards However its rolls along as it treads and parodies reality TV shows A good break from shows like Cops Truly at the end just a guilty pleasure My Rating 710 Eliason A
1,this movie makes me laugh by even just thinking about it such a smart comedy very precise yet easy the casting can not be any better all actors are the best choice of their roles and they all play precisely the best and there is no stupid laughs or shouting through out the whole movie layers and the progress of story work perfectly together and the rhythm flow smoothly the greatest of all is when the Village Peoples YMCA is cued in it brings out the importance of the Indians statute which was only briefly brought up previously in the movie which makes the smartest and funniest climax among many comedies I give it a ten especially a lot of times comedies are so underrated
1,This is a great compendium of interviews and excerpts form the films of the late sixties and early 70s that were a counter movement to the big Studio Films of the late sixties Directed by Ted Demme it is obviously a labor of love of the films of the period but it gives short shrift to the masterpieces of the times Many of the filmmakers of this period were influenced by Truffaut Antonioni Fellini Bergman and of course John Cassavetes Unfortunately the documentary logging in at 138 minutes is too short The film is rich with interviews and opinions of filmmakers Some of the people interviewed are Martin Scorsese Francis Coppola Robert Altman Peter Bogdonovich Ellen Burstyn and Roger Corman Bruce Dern Sydney Pollack Dennis Hopper and Jon Voight Bruce Dern has a moment of truth when he says that he and Jack Nicholson may not have been as good looking as the other stars that came before them but they were interesting This summarizes the other areas of this period of filmmaking in American history The filmmakers were dealing with a lack of funding from the Studios because they were expressing unconventional attitudes about politics sex drugs gender and race issues and Americas involvement in overseas conflicts like the Vietnam War There is a great interview with Francis Coppola saying that he got the chance to make The Conversation because the producers knew he had been trained by Roger Corman to make a movie with nothing so they bankrolled his film Another interview is with Jon Voight who was directed by Hal Ashby in Coming Home a clear antiwar film about a crippled soldier immersing himself back into society after his facing battle Voight talks about how his working methods helped him achieve an emotional telling point when Ashby said that they were doing a rehearsal take and it ended up being the take used in the film it was better because it was so unrehearsed and not drained of its freshness by being overrehearsed There are also many fine excerpts from Al Pacinos breakthrough film The Panic in Needle Park and interviews from Dennis Hopper on the making of Easy Rider and interviews from Sydney Pollack about making films All in all the documentary is a fine jumping off point for any film lover who wants to see great examples of what the new voices in film were like in the Seventies Many of the Sundance Folks where this film made a big splash are unaware of just how much the Independent Film Maker today owes to the films of John Cassavetes Milos Foreman William Friedkin and Roger Corman Rent it from your favorite shop It will at least perk you up to some films you may not have seen before and can enjoy today Amazoncom has it for as little as 1150 if you want to buy right out
1,A group of obnoxious teens go to a former funeral parlor for a Halloween party They get trapped inside and become possessed by demons that they have accidentally awakened The possessed teens start killing the others off and seem to be led by Angela Mimi Kinkade who floats and talks in a really deep voice The remaining teens that havent been possessed yet are forced to fight off the demons and try to escape the house This is a pretty decent horror film with great special effects which include Linnea Quigley who has a couple nude scenes as usual gouging out a guys eyeballs and pushing a tube of lipstick into her nipple Theres also a scene where a couple has sex in a coffin and a guy getting his tongue bitten out This is a great film to watch with a bunch of friends late at night while eating some pizza The terrible acting and atrocious dialog almost ruins it though Overall I would give it a 7 out of 10
1,Things that are only just now news were taken as a given in this shocking documentary I fear that as the investigation proceeds the producers of this film will be vindicated in spades The producers show us the Davidians the government agents the investigators with all their faults and all their humanity Nothing any reviewer can say could approach the impact of watching and listening for yourself Pieces of evidence  Congressional testimony 911 tapes news footage expert commentary interviews photos and home videos  are seamlessly woven together and tell a disturbing tale  Do not wait See this film and tell your friends
1,this is one of the finest movies i have ever seenthe stark scenerythe isolationthe ignorant bigoted people hiding behind their religiona backdrop for some wordliness and sophisticationthe acting is completely naturalbut for me as afoodie the best is the actual choosing and preparation of the feasti have spent time in paris and know the cuisine wellwhether or not the cafe anglais really exists i dont know but i do know of similar establishments and babettes menu and choice of wines are authenticand of course the end where despite themselves the perfect meal mellows them back to friendship is the only ending there could bethis is a 10 out of 10 film and should be seen by anyone with enough brain and taste to understand it
1,Bears about as much resemblance to Dean Koontzs novel as Jessica Simpson does to a rocket scientist If youve read the book I suggest you put it as far out of your mind as possible before watching the movie Watchers is your typical Boy meets dog dog turns out to be superintelligent government lab experiment dog and boy are pursued by superintelligent and emotionally disturbed monster created by same lab and oh yeah did I mention the shady government agents pursuing the monster pursuing the dog movie Corey Haim is the boy Barbara Williams is his mother Michael Ironside is one of the evil government guys and Sandy the dog is well the dog named Furface here Einstein in the book The monster effects are ridiculously cheesy much of the dialogue is laughable the script rarely makes sense or is believable  a good example is Haims characters unquestioning acceptance of the dogs intelligence as if every Fido off the street can type messages on a computer keyboard or bark once for yes and twice for no Hmm its gotta be the puppy chow right Haims performance is enthusiastic but shaky as he carries off the stupid dialogue with the least amount of skill Ironside has been the highlight of many a bad movie and this is no exception He easily gives the best performance of the movie although Im compelled to add that the dog whos a pretty darn good actor himself comes in a close second All in all an atrociously dumb movie and yet    And yet I watched it three times within a week And yet I cant help liking it Hey what can I say I have a taste for junk  and Michael Ironside not that Ive ever actually tasted Michael Ironside Im sure there are laws against that But any movie that can make me laugh that hard yes even unintentionally cant be all bad Chalk it up to a guilty pleasure a yes I know its insultingly stupid but I like it anyway movie Its tough for me to rate this On a normal scale Im forced to give it a D but on my own personal cheese scale it gets bumped up to an A Yeah I know Im weird like that
1,121701 All I can do with this film is improvise on my impressions I wasnt given the changes dont know the score and am not schooled in the genre I always had problems following chord changes anyway trumpet player yknow so I was pretty well limited to doing the basic keep the tune in mind and ad lib around that What jammed me up about this incredibly moody black and white blues piece was the knot it gave me in my head and heart in trying to figure out whether to go with the ensemble or pick out a path along the tune story I guess I went with the tune as usual I kept getting lost on the changestoo deep extensive over my head probably Still it was a gas to try to keep pace I admired the actors playing to the theme and story line I didnt see some things or heare things others seem to I didnt feel the light skin gal was trying to pass as much as she was either oblivious to the color issue or was trying to ignore itat first later she came back fighting The brooding light skin young man his trumpet noodling mas ludicrous was ambiguous ambivalent and perhaps his best featureremote What I thought after the shadowcurtain closed on this provocative pieceis the foundation of a thing like this Is it a way of finding reality by setting up a stage peopling it with expressive characters and giving them a melody and theme Is it any more real or truthful than a wellcrafted scriptwithout the benefit of editing and revising Is improvisation heroic artiermoreso than crafted work Where is there greater or clearer truth in retrospective artcraft or in fabrication and reformation Well I am still lost in this question I loved the film it got me lost in a cool blue foggy evening where I just had to go home and get out my horn Guess what I broke out in a twelvebar blues riff tried and truecouldnt make myself stray from the tune Reality is just too scary jaime says give them a 7 and more Im on break
1,TurkishGerman director Faith Akın HeadOn  The Edge of Heaven follows German musician and HeadOn soundtrack composer Alexander Hacke of Einstürzende Neubauten to Istanbul for this documentary which delves into the modern music scene of the city from arabesque to indie rock and was screened out of competition at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival Alexander Hacke makes for an amiable guide as he travels around Istanbul with a mobile recording studio and a microphone in hand where he runs into and records the likes of classic rocker Erkin Koray rapper Ceza Kurdish singer Aynur Doğan Arabesque singer Orhan Gencebay and pop star Sezen Aksu as well as rock bands Baba Zula Duman and Replikas The director has pulled together a diverse collection of popular performers and groundbreaking acts from what was at the time a highly competitive shortlist to give an eclectic account of modern Turkish music as seen from the streets of its cultural capital which will enchant and entertain even if at times it seems a little rushed and unfocused Music can reveal to you everything about a place
1,I came across The Last Stop one day at a video store and they were selling it for only 2 I decided to give it a try and bought it It was pretty good i enjoyed it The story is about several people all caught in a cabin somewhere in nowhere because of a raging blizzard There is a police officer nancyhis ex girlfriend two brothers that just got out of jail a older man and his lover a black man and the couple that owns the cabins and their retarted son that never speaks Suddenly someone is found to be murdered and a bag full of cash is found Everyone is a suspect The Last Stop is a pretty good thriller i would give it 810
1,I saw this film on 19SEP2009 at the Cambridge Film Festival  The Beagles only in a couple of short flashbacks the whole thing is about Darwins life from 1841 to 1859 when he was ensconced in Kent with his growing family 200 pages of Origin had already been drafted and he was wondering whether to complete the book  The script is based on Randal Keyness book Annies Box Annie Charless daughter died when she was 10 It is mostly a family drama but does include sex scenes  however the participants are married both on and off screen Not too exciting not much science but a wellmade film thats pleasant to watch and pushes the right emotional buttons A bit of a romantic weepie actually I suppose the conclusion is that you can be an agnostic freethinking scientist from an atheist family background and still be an emotional romantic as well as an excellent father  Some of the characters and Darwin himself state or wonder whether he killed god but the viewer is able to doubt that What is beyond doubt given the deadly struggle for survival and the web of predation on the meadowbank wellknown before Darwin and completely uncontroversial and the failure of Darwins prayers is that the idea of a kind providential god who loves his creatures is untenable  I really cannot see many Americans objecting to it very much Some may have problems with the title which is probably the most controversial thing about the film or with the fact that Bettany does not have horns a tail and a pitchfork
1,This is one of the movies having made significant influence on me as a person The sound tracks are best and the performance is excellent Just a great movie for ever to time limit just for the entire live you must have in your collection This is one of the movies having made significant influence on me as a person The sound tracks are best and the performance is excellent Just a great movie for ever to time limit just for the entire live you must have in your collection This is one of the movies having made significant influence on me as a person The sound tracks are best and the performance is excellent Just a great movie for ever to time limit just for the entire live you must have in your collection
1,I like movies that show real people Americans and tell truth The movie is simple and that seems to be the great thing about it It played here in Norway fine Amazon says above that its USACanda but the box states All Regions I have to say it is not for the American viewers It played in here in World Raw Views a theater I saw it and later I ordered it The cut was different and much better See it and you will like it or maybe hate it Sorry Bush lovers but this movie is driving you crazy because it makes sense Get angry and hate it Disagree with everything in it but I for one stand by it Its not for the empty minds It is long and too hard to keep up with but by the second viewing it makes more sense I loved Owens words and the poem made me cry
1,This film is absolute cinematic genius It has a well brought together cast who give an almost magical performance The effects are nothing but stunning and the story will keep you hanging off your chair right the way through the movie Jack Long plays the part of abbot white exceptionally well he provides an immensely thrilling portrayal of absolute evil If your a kung fu fan or just an action movie enthusiast this film is an excellent choice for anyone who is lucky enough to find a copy For any big kung fu fans this movie provides a compelling insight into the world of shaolin This film is definitely 1010 quality and should be considered as one of the greatest eastern movies of all time
1,The Kinks warned about media heroes Outside the movies most heroes are also Ordinary People Society demands some role playing but what happens when that extends to the parentchild relationship Do some parents try to improve themselves through their children rather than vice versa How do you provide a rolemodel but not a role A brilliant swimmer who hates to swim a brilliant musician who wont play Offbeat funny despite depiction of serious problems very good multidimensional acting by everyone Lots of plot twists complement the emotional tension Celluloid heroes never feel any pain I dont recall ever being disappointed in a Sigourney Weaver film I even liked The Village
1,Brilliant film I am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like Pulp F but thats how it is with post pulp era Many pictures get automatically likened to it for only being a gangster flick But this one is well written funny coincidences ordinary gangsters who are family men resemble something from Tarantino which is a good similarity Anyway the films about a guy bloke in Australia which is getting mixed up with a hard core crime gang and ends up in a debt and deep sit To his assistance is his deceased brother anyone remember Val Kilmer in True R to pay of his debt and escape from the gangsters who are on his trail The gangsters are cold blooded but take the time to play chess and focus on the upbringing of their children They also get served tea from their granny while planning a bank robbery and have trouble what to do with their kids during the robbery So a humorous gangster flick with Heath Ledger in good form though Im not a fan  and Bryan Brown in great action as a gang leader
1,For those of you who have no idea what Bug Juice is or was it was a childrens reality show about real kids living at summer camp Bug Juice is the show that inspired me to go to camp It was full of romance friendships fights overcoming your fears and dealing with the struggles of living away from home for 2 months It was an amazing show that is no longer shown on tv regularly but is amazing nontheless The show was never dull and always attracted my attention Its really nice for kids who have never been to a summer camp to really see what its like before going Plus Disney did a really good job of picking camps to showcase because who wants to see a show thats at a camp for like only a week The length of the camps where perfect for this show and the environment they where in was fantastic They where camps all over the US that each provided unique activities for the campers It was a truly amazing unscripted show
1,Highly recommended to all those who appreciate watching movies Great acting perfectly surreal awkward humor requisite prison sht accurate depiction of the male condition Music is also spoton I think the artist is Dip but not sure The short loop of the title credit song on the DVD menu is welltimed and sounds like Slint one thing to know is that IMDb maintains a ridiculous policy of a MINIMUM comment length based on not CHARACTERS not WORDS but rather LINES Measuring post quality and quantity based on LINES in the bold era of UNICODE and flexible webbased typography is like smoking poles  Your comment does not contain enough lines  the minimum length for comments is 10 lines of text Please see the guidelines Attempts to pad the comment with junk words can result in your account being blocked from future submissions
1,I just watched it for the second time today and I must say with all my heart it is about damn time they made a movie about us as people not as spiritual beings Such a waste of human life as this story was maybe some good will come out of it And Eric is hotter than ever To often in the movies First Nations people are seen as other than everyday people We are always portrayed as chiefs or medicine people Hey we are just like everyone else And this movie showed just that We hurt when an injustice is done and we can win in quest for justice It is really to bad that the big movie companies cant see that I cant wait till this comes out on DVD Thanks to those who chose to show this story as it really was
1,Critters 4 This movie was continued after the 3rd critters movies This one was released in the same years as critters 3 was released in 1991 Critters 4 takes you in space as they hunt for the humans in a space ship I doubt if there will be a Critters 5 because the ending for the 4th was quite a good ending which brought the end to the critters as there was no more left I give this movie 10 out of 10
1,Such an awesome movie  I was transfixed the entire time and so emotionally overcome in the end The two young male actors in the movie were more than compelling in their performance as their friendship and support of one another was quite believable and I thought the comparisoncontrast between their respective home lives vs health situations were made so very real between them The success in bringing this movie to life was obviously a team effort so to actors EPs producers writers directors and all of production I say WELL PLAYED Having missed the credits at the beginning of the movie it was being shown on HBO I was so very surprised that I had to actually research albeit briefly the internet in order to find the title of this movie  something so great should have been known by me  a clear indication that this movie must be rereleased
1,Farscape totally rules In my opinion its very close to Babylon five although there are only 7 main characters in the series spaceship included The humour is excellent and the writers manage to keep the show interesting though pretty much everything happens on the ship What I really love and appreciate in Farscpae isthat they dont use CGI for the alien characters or if they do its unnoticeable They use those lovable crappy rubber animatronic puppets very similar to the ones used in the original Star Wars Farscape is something you definitely want to look into if you already havent
1,Well What to say I think i shall start with a confession I have cried 4 times in my life once when my dad died twice due to a girlfriend in high school and at the end of this film This film deals with the real confronting issues of 6 school kids forcing them quite uncomfortably into the open for all the world to see i have never seen a film that deals with the human emotional condition as well as this everything from incest to incontinence is covered here and i doubt there are many people who are safe from the sting of familiarity with at least a couple of scenes It starts off with a suicide at 237pm then without letting you know who it was that died the story begins to be told from the start of the day it follows the lives of 6 school kids up until 237pm it interchangeably and edited with personal interviews of the 6 teenagers lets you know everything about their lives their loves hates dreams desires secrets shame false confidence self loathing corruption and arrogance the overall outcome of which is a sort of whodunnit trying to discover the identity of the suicidal before it is revealed at the end of the film without spoiling anything i must let you know do not feel cheated by the ending it contains a very important lesson And now a warning this film is definitely NOT for the faint hearted Many people actually walked out of the cinema half way through when i saw it Disgusted by some of its content Or perhaps its that its sometimes hard to face the cold hard truth of reality This is what high school is like for many people im sure most would agree
1,Director and auteur JeanPierre Rappenau was 8 years old during the spring of 1940 as Frances Third Republic disintegrated in a matter of a few weeks It was a time he says when all the adults were a little bit insane He and the production staff have lovingly and meticulously recreated that world in a film where all the characters are essentially fictional The structure a classic farce is ideal for the period as multiple plot lines zip and intersect only to come together in a logical satisfying conclusion The peg for this plot is Frederic played by brilliant newcomer Gregory Derangere who is fully up to playing opposite Adjani Depardieu and Ledoyen The real strength of the film is in its supporting performances M Rappeneau has cast the film exquisitely with actors who volunteered ideas for both action and dialogue and who know and prove that it is possible to fully realize a character with just two short sentences of dialogue Though not yet as widely influential as Renoirs Rules of the Game Bon Voyage richly deserves to be a companion piece to that classic Though it demands a lot of the audience it gives much back One of its demands is tolerance for a certain coyness and misdirection as to the exact genre we are watching a crime melodrama no a spy thriller ah a romantic comedy Recommend it to cinemaphile friends Just be sure to let them discover for themselves that it is a romantic comedy
1,This outstanding film has about the best acting that youll ever see and that alone makes this a mustsee The entire cast is excellent but then again it had to be in order to keep up with Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep It didnt take me long to get hooked on this film and aside from a courtroom scene that is merely good this is topnotch entertainment This is a rare film that actually deserved all the Oscar recognition that it received See it for yourself and you will definitely not be disappointed
1,John Cusack stars as Hoops in this silly little movie that has to be one of the best of the eighties teen comediesBelieve it or not Demi Moore is his co starIf you love the eightiesgrew up around that timeor are an angst ridden teenage artist get ready to laughWait until you see the cartoonswhat a riot
1,twenty years later this movie still remains as entertaining as when you first watched it In a movie market overrun by toilet humor graphic violence and foul language its refreshing to be fully entertained for two hours by such a clean movie
1,I was very curious to see this WajdaDepardieu outing plus the time period is definitely fascinating Being a Wajda fan I was disappointed and that may be an understatement The film never really took cinematic flight  theres no foundation for the animosity between Danton and Robespierre etc Basically the script was weak adapted from The Danton Affair And yet the direction was masterfulits Wajda afterall Also there were some amazing actors BUT they never really grab the audiences attention like they should Depardieu comes off as a quasigoofy nonchalant Dantonnot exactly the image we have in mind Woijech Pzsoniak is incredible as usual but again the script puts up limits even actors of great talent cant break down Andrzej Seweryn and Bogoslaw Linda pop up  as Bourdon and SaintJustand if youre familiar with Wajda then youd know them Overall I was disappointed with this muchlauded film Great cast great director but no quality foundation Bad undynamic script We need to get in Danton Walesa and Robespierres General J mindsets what are their motivations Ehwho knows One likes women the other powders himself Riiight Ok so if youre looking for a great French Revolution movie I HIGHLY recommend La Revolution Francaiseits in two parts and ohsogreat Excellent performances indepth script juicy tid bitsdefinitely a satisfying experience KlausMaria Brandauer is a much better Danton than Depardieuthe wonderful Andrzej Seweryn apparently took some notes from Danton and is BRILLIANT as Robespierre SEE IT NOW As for Wajda fans  youre better off with Man of IronMarble Promised Land and the like Cheers
1,Who doesnt love the muppets Impossible it is to watch them without getting some kind of warm fuzzy feeling inside So I guess whats important is that this movie seemed to very successfully capture what makes the muppets so special I dont remember much about the details of the plot but the various moments and characters in the film I recall quite fondly In fact there was quite a nostalgic atmosphere to the whole movie but without being selfconscious in any bad way Refreshing for someone who possibly gets too hung up on meticulous details and technique the magic transcends all that other stuff Tis indeed what movies are made of So how does the film achieve these things Hmmm nice question Stumped am I Lets see Really I feel like its quite simple The filmmakers believe in their material and dont take themselves too seriously in the process I probably wouldnt say the film has many truly inspired moments but it does have a certain life to it that funnily enough a great many real people movies lack A zest You really want to believe in these funny little people and their adventures They also have a certain innocence about them that makes them all the more endearing Generally I get the impression that the people that made the movie just werent afraid to try whatever felt right to them at the time which gives the whole thing quite a loose feel Kind of like a really accessible and enjoyable extended jazz session Lots of talent little predictability and plenty of warm personalities coming through The cameos were of course a bunch of nice surprises for instance Maybe I dont feel I have much to say about it because I was halfasleep when I saw it andor as I write this review Anyway Im sort of semirepeating myself here but I really liked the sense of family the movie had Full of love I suppose you might say Again a feeling of nostalgia comes to mind which not many films manage to achieve so effectively or effortlessly And to repeat myself once more one of the films best charms is its very relaxed and welcoming atmosphere Like the Nathaniel Hawthorne quote about happiness being like a butterfly so The Muppet Movie greatly succeeds partially by not seeming to try to do so Same with beauty being best undiscovered or untouched or unforced or something like that Anyway if that sounds sappy I also reckon it was pretty hilarious So all in all this movie was very funny touching and difficult not to smile along to Plus it features lots of great music Highly recommended to all humans both the young and the young at heart
1,Anyone who has ever gone on an audition can certainly relate to this one Great story of an aspiring actor and the pressures he must deal with both personally and professionally in order to make it to the big time Lou Myers as HalfStep Wilson provides many hilarious moments
1,Onstage John Osbornes adaptation of Picture of Dorian Gray is a fine tribute to Oscar Wildes talents as both novelist and playwrightOn screen with some editing it becomes a bit sloppy due to the cutting of 3 crucial scenes from the play one being an important scene between Basil and Henry showing that time has passedThe acting however is brilliant Sir john Gielgud returns to his Wilde roots as lord Henryand although about a decade too old for the rolehe totally becomes the enigmaticlife loving cad and cynic that Wilde brought to life so meticulously in his novella Jeremy Brett is also strongoffering a touching portrait of the anguished artist Basil HallwardPeter Firthwhile not originally my vision of Dorian handles the role with style and graceand later with a convincing strain of cruelty The supporting cast is equally fine Gielguds former Importance Of Being Earnest costar Gwen FranconDavies plays his philanthropic Aunt Agatha with dignity and Judi Bowker makes a touching Sybil Vane The witpathos and tension of Wildes work have been remarkably transferred to the screen My only other qualm is with the hair styles Many of them seemed out of placelooking more like 1970s versions of Victorian hairdos rather than the actual style Overall howeverthe acting and writing elevates this production to a high level of small screen excellence
1,Movie watchers often say great movies must have 3 memorable scenes to be considered truly great Broadcast news doesnt have three it has twice that This movie is extremely well written by James Brooks Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks have never been better I love this movie for many reasons It is great because it makes you laugh and it makes you cry Albert Brooks has several great lines and many unforgettable scenes  1laughed I can sing and read I am singing while I read with Midnight Train to Georgia playing in the background  2laughed Telling the William Hurt character that You really blew the lid off of nookie after watching Hurts report on daterape 3 Cried When Aaron A Brooks finally tells Jayne Hunter that he loves her and she cant end up with Hurts character because he represents everything about journalism Jayne finds dispicable Finally 4 laughed who can forget the scene where Aaron anchors the weekend newshilarious This movie should have won an Oscar It has everything I love in movies great acting intelligent script and even a Jack Nicholson cameo
1,This HTV series is beautiful I strongly recommend watching the movie It has got everything it should remarkable script strong characters beautiful scenery and exceptional atmosphere Add some ambient score from Clannad and you receive unforgettable picture I love every adventure movie from HTV I saw Return To Treasure Island Smuggler Adventurer but Robin of Sherwood beats them all I would like to thank the whole HTV production team and Richard Carpenter in particular for giving me plenty of adventures and excitement I have got the DVD release in my little movie collection I regret very much movies like these are not made anymore
1,Classe tous risques feels like the granddaddy of The Sopranos in mixing the criminal and the domestic and of the buddy film to feel as contemporary as Reservoir Dogs Even as these gangsters are affectionately entangled with wives children lovers and parents they are coldly ruthless and we are constantly reminded they are no matter what warm situation we also see them in They can tousle a kids hair  and then shoot a threat in cold blood The key is loyalty and the male camaraderie is beautifully conveyed without ethnic or class stereotypes even as their web of past obligations and pay backs narrows into suspicion and paranoia as the old gang is in various stages of parole retirement out on bail or into new less profitable ventures An intense accusation is of sending a stranger to perform an old escape scenario It is a high point of emotion when a wife is told off that shes not the one the gangster is friends with while virtually the only time we hear music on the soundtrack is when he recalls his wife Streetscapes in Italy and France are marvelously used in blinding daylight to dark water and highways from the opening set up of a pair of brazen robbers  who are traveling with ones wife and two kids Rugged craggy Lino Ventura captures the screen immediately as the criminal dad And the second thug is clearly a casually avuncular presence in their lives as they smoothly coordinate the theft and escape in cars buses on boats and motorcycles in easy tandem This is not the cliché crusty old guy softened with the bigeyed orphan these are their jobs and their families and they intersect in horrific ways The film pulls no punches in unexpectedly killing off characters directly and as collateral damage and challenging our sympathy for them right through to the unsentimental end which is probably why there was never an American remake  It seems so fresh that its not until JeanPaul Belmondo enters almost a third of the way into the film looking so insouciant as a young punk that one realizes that this is from 1960 Sultry Sandra Milo has smart and terrific chemistry with him from an ambulance to an elevator to a hospital bed While the Film Forum was showing a new 35 mm print with newly translated subtitles it was not pristine The program notes explained that the title refers to a kind of insurance policy and is pun on tourist class
1,This is the latest entry in the long series of films with the French agent OSS 117 the French answer to James Bond The series was launched in the early 1950s and spawned at least eight films none of which was ever released in the US OSS117CairoNest Of Spies is a breezy little comedy that should notrepeat NOT be taken too seriously Our protagonist finds himself in the middle of a spy chase in Egypt with Morroco doing stand in for Egypt to find out about a long lost friend What follows is the standard James BondInspector Cloussou kind of antics Although our man is something of an overt xenophobesexisthomophobe its treated as pure farce as I said dont take it too seriously Although there is a bit of rough language  cartoon violence its basically okay for older kids ages 12  up As previously stated in the subject line just sit backpass the popcorn  just enjoy
1,Mr Bean has always been my favorite No matte how many times you watch the same thing the show never gets monotonous or repetitive Mr Bean is one of the greatest comedians in the world who doesnt need to even speak to make people laugh His gestures his facial expressions and his face itself is so funny to watch The situations which he faces on the show is simply hilarious and the way he handles them is even greater There is simply no reason why this show shouldnt receive a 10 because it is fabulous Its something that would even make the most serious or sad person in the universe laugh Some of my all time favorites episodes from the show are 1 When Mr Bean lodges at a hotel 2 The one where he watches the scary film 3 Mind the baby  The diaper scene especially In fact all the episodes are so good that it is really difficult to criticize the show MrBean can go to any heights to prove that he is funny including completely stripping himself in one of the episodes the way he handled that situation was simply mind blowing 10 out of 10
1,The Love Letter is one of my alltime favorite books so naturally I was skeptical when I heard it was to become a movie But I liked it I found myself grinning through the entire movie I admit that it isnt a great movie but definitely a pleasant hour and a half I thought that Capshaw and Scott were perfect as Helen and Johnny Just as I pictured them And the town and scenery were just right as well I recommend this film but dont expect too much just enjoy it
1,Remember that this came out before Gulf War I which gave us Werner Herzogs Lessons of Darkness Le Dernier Combat is not Sci Fi Its more like Judgment Ive watched it at least a dozen times It really is a fitting companion to Herzogs Lessons of Darkness And in that time men will seek death but they will not find it for death will flee from them That someday alas may be today in Iraq  But back to Le Dernier Combat make sure to watch thru the very last second of the film I wouldnt call it a surprise ending but it is something youll miss if you just assume the end wont be anything more than what you will already have seen
1,When it was released in the beginning of the 80s Pixote brings to Brazilian society the problems of young delinquents and the impact of this in Brazilian society I cant watch the movie at that time cause I was too young but now I got a chance and watched It a few days ago Its a very brutal movie but everything is absolutely true and sad pixote is the name of a 12 yearold boy who lives in the streets and survive with misdemeanors he stays for a while in a house of detention and when he left it he continues to plan robs with other buns and a prostitute played by marilia Pera the boy is still a marijuana addicted and smell glue with another teenagers to forget his sad reality the quality of the images its not the best but the movie is totally realistic about Brazilian problems and must be viewed and admired
1,I havent seen this funny of a show on fox in a long time and the wait was worth it The kids in the show have something that i can relate to on every episode and even my dad will sit down and watch it It is a show not for all ages that doesnt dumb down for kids It is like still standing but to the next level The stuff that everyone says is stuff that everyone says and actions that everyone does It says stuff that we all think but in a well rounded way of presentation The first time i saw the show i could not believe that it was on fox and that it was allowed to stay on the air after a few episodes from Hilarys boyfriend choices to Kennys boyfriend choices it is well worth the watch
1,After watching Oldboy I was a little disappointed by the rest of Parks work some of it is good but it never approaches the level of humour and originality that Oldboy had This one does it is nothing like Oldboy in plot or style but the same level of quality is there The acting is good with Kangho Song OKbin Kim and Hakyun Shin delivering excellent performances Kim in particular manages to swap from the creepy horror scenes to the surreal comedy without the slightest misstep The plot is strange with lots of twists and turns and takes a big swipe at the vampire clichés The directing is spot on with tons of pace and humour throughout and some of the most memorable scenes I have ever seen It does boast what is probably the weirdest love scene you will ever see This is just a great film
1, Since cats have nine lives Ill give you nine reasons to see this movie  The kittens Berlioz and Toulouse playing the piano together so unbelievably cute  The carchasing dogs Napoleon and Lafayette  Toulouse jumping like electrified every time he wants to be like a tough alley cat  Marie sighing romantically while alley cat OMalley seduces her mom  Scat Cat and his jazz band singing evrybody wants to be a cat  Stupid but proper and nice English geese Amelia and Abigail who make the cats walk like geese  OMalley obtaining the magic carpet which puts the Cheshire cat to shame  Roquefort the brave mouses journey to ask help from alley cats  Edgar the butler chase scenes and transition from a nice guy to an insane cat hater due to cat riddance plan gone bad
1,I saw this in a theatre back in 1982 I expected a stupid TA movie Thats not what I got Its basically about three teenage boys trying to have sex We get the expected sex jokes and scenesbut for once theyre actually pretty funny Yeah theyre stupid but I enjoyed them anyways Also there was a surprising amount of male nudity Then the movie about halfway through takes a sudden dramatic turn as one of the boys winningly played by Lawrence Monoson falls in love with a girl Then the jokes stop and things get very dark Im not going to give away what happens but I was very surprised at the sudden turn in events The movie brings up some very important subjects and treats them realistically and with intelligence And it has a real heartbreaking ending Im giving this a 10 because this is probably one of the best teen sex comedydramas ever made It mixes fantasy and realism together and works What more can you ask for Also it has a GREAT soundtrack
1,One type of western I greatly enjoy is when the apparently weak which is reluctant to fight and answer the challenge of the strong finally decides there is no other way There is a great moment in this film when John Parrish Glenn Ford goes into the saloon and decides to stand up to the gunfighter Wade Matlock It is the type of scene that makes the audience applaud In my opinion The Violent Men is a great western I would rank it among the best It makes great use of the wide screen a spectacular scenery of the mountains The women have a crucial part Caroline May Winn is engaged to Parrish but you feel that she is only using him as a means of getting out of there and moving east She wants him to sell the ranch no matter what price Martha Barbara Stanwick is tired of helping her crippled husband Lee Edward G Robinson but she will do anything to have an always bigger ranch and more power Meanwhile she is betraying her husband with his brother Brian Keith Her daughter Judith Diane Foster is seeing all that happens but feeling impotent to react because she does not want to hurt her father Parrish unites all the small farmers and uses the strategy he learned in the army to go against the Anchor ranch Like he had warned Lee Dont make me fight because you wont like my way of fighting
1,After three outstanding BBC television series and a Christmas special the bizarre and grotesque yet perversely lovable characters of bleak fictional town Royston Vasey make the jump to celluloid along with their creators  The League of Gentlemen  Mark Gatiss Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith are the more familiar threequarters of the foursome with the central roles shared between the trio In an added twist the final member of the team  Jeremy Dyson  is portrayed by actor Michael Sheen  Where to start Dyson Sheen is in conversation with his writing cohorts when  horror of horrors  he is paid a visit by two of his grisliest characters Both Tubbs Pemberton and Edward Tattsyrup Shearsmith are unhappy at The Leagues decision to kill off the Vasey inhabitants Youre not real screams Dyson in vain as the local shopkeepers from hell exact their revenge Mayhem ensues as reality and Vasey converge with the vast array of characters entering our world to save theirs  Confused You will be as the camp innuendoridden Teutonic Herr Lipp Pemberton is forced to take on the daily guise of Pemberton Pemberton while Pemberton Pemberton is kidnapped by cannibalistic butcher Hillary Briss Gatiss and Geoff Tipps Shearsmith  With shades of an even more demented Misery Briss attempts to force Pemberton to rewrite the film  thus continuing his life  but leaving Geoff in charge is never a good idea The erstwhile comedian becomes embroiled in The Leagues latest postVasey adventure  The Kings Evil  entering a typically twisted 17th century England complete with cameos from Victoria Wood Peter Kay and David Warner Known as George of Asda due to his select line of clothing Geoff saves the day and is treated as a hero but for the denouement of the film he joins characters old and new at the Church of Royston Vasey to meet with their makers  For fans of the series the film is a mustsee And yes it does feature Papa Lazarou albeit a little too fleetingly Penloving Pauline Mickey Barbara and cursed vet Matthew Chinnery are some of the other favourites on show and The Leagues portrayal of themselves plus Sheens as Dyson is also a fascinating insight  The League of Gentlemen are the Radiohead of British comedy  they are ambitious groundbreaking witness the excellent Series Three and not happy to rest on their laurels They also divide opinion accordingly Certainly their macabre sense of humour is not for every palate and while not written exclusively for fans a grasp of the storyline would benefit those who have previously viewed the series Nevertheless Apocalypse is a film in its own right and The League will no doubt manage to attract a new breed of fan as well as appeasing and pleasing existing ones
1,When I first heard about Greek I figured I would watch it because it sounded ridiculous Another of ABC Familys sobadtheyrealmostgood shows But tuning in with a friend from college found us both enjoying the pilot episode a lot more than we had expected As a member of a Greek society I can say that a lot of the stereotypes that are brought up here are ones that come up almost every time someone starts talking about the sororities and fraternities on a campus And are also very fun to play with just on are own let alone to watch on a TV screen The opening scene harkened to an onlyslightlydramatized version of preparing for an actual formal rush in some sororities and it continued on from there This isnt a show for oversensitive Greeks If you get offended even at jokes about things that arentsogreat about Greek life then youll spend the entire first episode and probably many other cringing and yelling But everyone else should have a ton of fun watching it Its nothing new but when it comes to college nothing ever is
1,This movie is funny and sad enough I think that it is kinda true If you love Office Space then you will love this movie because it is another Mike Judge hit but it is nothing like Office Space I told every one to see this movie I only wish that it would have been in more theaters so it would have gotten the recognition it deserved I love this movie and would love to see more from Mike Judge Luke Wilson is also what makes this movie what it is I am so glad that I will not be alive in the year 2505 because if this movie turns out to be true we are all in for a lot of trouble I just hope more people see this movie because I know that they will fall in love with it too
1,Jack Webbs movie The DI came about from the real life investigation into the deaths of several trainees in a swamp in Paris Isle in the 50s As always Webb being the patriot that he is came to the defense much like all the rest of his shows I actually found this movie tame by 1957 standards I served in the Army and can understand the intensity of the training at Parris Island Camp Death by someso this movie can never come close as does Full Metal Jacket I think this is a good movie which is more patriot than it is actual But again think of the time period it was made 1957 and what could be allowed and said on film at that time I have always found Jack Webb to be clean cut and very loyal I know many have criticized the film as onesided and government propaganda If you feel this way watch Full Metal Jacket with R Lee Ermey I am a Webb fan and enjoy the movie for its merit not accuracy As I have said Webb believed in this country and held institutions to high moral standards LAPDDragnetAdam 12 Emergency etc Just sit back and enjoy this one from a very strict moral time period in this country Dont be too judgemental of Mr Webb Mark Lockwood Lubbock Texas
1,OKso by minute 15 in the film theres still no dialogue This film arrived to me in a padded sack from Down Under with Sharpie encrypted info on the front I am a programmer from a North American fest and MOD LOVE was sent thru to me by our chief as a potential starter having preemd at the faraway MoscowKarlovy Vary interface Straight away I thought this film is not for us no dialogue by minute 15 but kept watching anyway Well well well It built and built and built and half way in I was involved in this film because like when you go to the zoo at first youre reticent but by the time you get to the dangerous snakes bit youre totally there This film has a dangerousness not at all like the much hyped WolF Creek but because it is so totally other in every way shape and form and seems to weave a web made up of all the fantasies of most independent firsttime helmers ie  gloomy weather redneck intrigue odd splicing eerie music and a plot which though imperfect and basic has a bit in common with one of the great Aussie Movies ie The Cars That Ate Paris by Wier But MODERN LOVE is actually not really a very Aussie movie in the sense of Ockerishness and playful selfdeprecation that pervades many of that countrys films It works on a more nightmarish realm from the start No cellphones no brand names no ipods no gritty urban middleclass angst  just a dude married to a goodlooker an old Volvo and a little boy son who has weird teeth and chucks stuff around Oh and its set in weird seaside village where people all look slightly wrong Photographed by Nick Matthews 237 and music by Tom Huzenroeder Ten Canoes MOD LUV succeeds where many Aust movies fail  ie it stands up without regard to the godforsaken country that it comes out of Instead it revels in a warped but entertaining riddle which the film itself cannot solve  and herein lies the weak linkwhat on earth does this film have to do with Modern Love The final minutes of the film seem to give an answer or at least hints at oneand as I sat and drank a coffee and ate my Hersheys afterwards all that I could surmise was that this films helmer Alex Frayne will prob have a lot of fun with this one
1,I believe the reason this movie did not get the recognition it deserves is because of the many misconceptions of Darwin pro and con I would say the real man is depicted here without sterility He is what he is Although the movie is but a snapshot of the man the technique of storytelling expanded his life far beyond the years touched on in the movie This is deep movie a pondering of modern life and the way we think and can provoke a study into the man whose thoughts and other who used him have certainly affected our lives There are some movies that the historical context is so great that it is the primary job of the actors to stay out of the way The history carried the day and the actors did their job Good work to them I say
1,Even though some unrealistic things happen at the end ie a cop shooting a gun into a crowded merrygoround where any number of innocent could be killed this still was an intense enjoyable thriller one of Alfred Hitchcocks better films Robert Walker is excellent as the chilling nutcase really convincing giving a fascinating performance that is almost too creepy at times His costar in here Farley Granger is okay but is no match for Walker either in acting or in the characters they play Its the typical Hitchcock film with some strange camera angles immoral themes innocent man gets in trouble etc Unlike a lot of his other films I thought this one was a fastmoving story with a very few dull spots Being an extennis player I enjoyed his footage of some excellent old net matches that featured some good rallies Hitchcocks reallife daughter Patricia has an interesting and unique minor character role in here She didnt just get the job because of her dad she can act Also of note the DVD has both the British and American versions and there were some differences in the story This is a classic film that is still referred to in modernday films even comedies such as Throw Momma Off The Train
1,The SevenUps seems like a replay of The French Connection which was released two years prior Both the late Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco make appearances as well as stunt driver Bill Hickman But we arent dealing with French drug baddies instead we are dealing with a war against assorted hoods and criminals after a cop is brutally killed by a hoodlum We get to see unpleasantness and a pre1990s New York City I love watching this film because it is exciting to see the action and it is a reminder of a cooler time That said when one compares the car chases Mr Hickman had involvement in the three most compared This movie Bullitt and The French Connection Each chase scene has its own qualities and this one is simply superb And I am glad this title has seen the light of day on DVD
1,Well on the day that Rob Schneider plunges himself further into the black hole of notoriously bad movies by starring in the absolutely notatallwanted Deuce Bigalow European Gigolo hmmmmwasnt there a film called Roadtrip which was followed by a sequel called Eurotrip And now theres Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo followed by sequel Deuce Bigalow European GigoloI smell a pattern Perhaps soon there will be Spiderman European webs are Hotteror not I am writing about this much maligned at time of release film I was one of those maligners I must admit I turned my nose up at it even while Chris Farley shoved cocaine up his nose and the SNL cast struggled through one of the worst seasons in their history in 9495 the Norm McDonald anchorship notwithstanding Films like Happy Gilmore Tommy Boy and Black Sheep came out in the couple years after this period and we realized there was a dark future for the caliber of SpadeFarleySchneiderSandler films However I watched this film the other day ten years after and 8 years after Chris died and could not stop laughing Yes its not particularly sophisticated Farley does what Farley does not unlike Manny being Manny but his Van Down By the River motivational speaker shtick in which he laments that while he may not wash enough or wear wellfitting clothes or use deodorant more than twice a week translates well here as the ever selfeffacing character who realizes hes not the brightest not the bestlooking and could stand to lose a few pounds All the same hes trying his best to do what hes supposed to And David Spade just tosses off his snide oneliners as he did for Spades Hollywood Minute and basically stings Farleys selfesteem Theres really not a whole lot more to say than that I love the one scene when Farley catches Spade spanking his monkey and then makes a couple quips about it Cant remember what the first one is but the second one theyre lying in their hotel beds and Farley says to Spade Do you like baseball Spade mutters something inaudible in response and Farleys says the New York YANKees Anyway Farley does his awkward painfully sensitive fratboy shtick If you like you like it I couldnt stop laughing
1,I saw this movie in the theater when I was 14 and it changed my life I immediately cut off my hair and began buying all of the records of the bands in the movie These were some of the seminal bands of LA punk rock caught on film at the peak of their powers Bands like Black Flag preRollins Circle Jerks Fear X and the Germs have few equals in the history of punk music I cant believe this film has never been put out on video or DVD Great movie for fans of punk rock
1,I have to say this is my favorite movie of all time I have seen it well over 100 times actually had to buy a new copy as a result of overwatching It is what the eighties was like and what a romantic story with a few morals thrown in I highly recommend to anyone wanting to relive the high schools days again Buy a copy now it is a classic
1,One cannot help but be impressed with the intelligence and scale of this film and simultaneously disappointed by the lost opportunities I found the script to be excellent and the vocal talent of Edmund Purdom quite impressive However as an artifact of its time the film suffers from too many Hollywoodisms especially poor casting too much lushness of the sets and too much pretentiousness Edmund Purdom who plays the title character is so obviously awkward with physical acting I suspect he had primarily been in Shakespearean theater before this So if movie people are reading this I propose this as an excellent candidate for a remake especially if you cast real Egyptians as Egyptians
1,Mr Carlin left our common forum in June of 2008 shortly after going to the hospital for pains in the chest he had a history of heart trouble The media and comics everywhere covered the loss more than I or he would have EVER expected  but he was the Grandfather of observational comedy THIS recording was his last production and contains a large section dedicated to the topic of death and the prospects of life thereafter Filming of the project occurred shortly after his seventieth birthday which he was happy to have attained observed I have followed Carlins career from the days of fuzzy black and white television and enjoyed his topical record albums It is a privilege for ANY Carlin fan to at least see if not own a copy of this particular show He was still fast moving and with great timing even at 70 As he would say he is NOT smiling down from Heaven on you If hes doing anything at all its not taking harp lessons perhaps hes looking up
1,The BBCS Blue Planet is simply jawdropping I dont think Im exaggerating when I say it contains some of the most beautiful sequences ever captured on film From familiar creatures on and near the surface of the ocean to some more unrecognisable and just plain bizarre ones in the murky depths next to nothing is left out Weighing in at a hefty 8 hours some people may want to check out the edited highlights brought to you in the form of the film Deep Blue but I would heartily recommend you give the series a go I dont think it will disappoint and if your kids enjoyed the aquatic world brought to them by Pixars Finding Nemo Im sure they will love this too I just wish all television was this entertaining
1,The Reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short Every element of the piece assists in eliciting a pure emotional response to the script Well acted directed shot and written I was surprised to hear that there was no rehearsal before shooting not even a read through The performances stand as testament to some fine instinctual acting in response to a well written script The actresses work was excellent and there was never an indication that their work would slip into the purely sentimental Less is much better in this case This film is a prime example of how these low budget contracts benefit actors as well as film makers
1,Jon Cryer reprises his role as a neurotic guy in Two and a Half Men which he perfected in this series He longs to have a good relationship with a girl like his coworker has developed and the tetatet between him and his partners girlfriends best friend are pretty funny Then they realize that theyre attracted to each other and start dating In one of the funniest lines on TV EVER  I think in the final episode  he and his partner are discussing that he wants to propose to the girl  His partner prepares him for the moment by suggesting Whats the worst that can happen She says no Armed with newfound optimism he proposes to his date over dinner To which she replies  GOD no I laughed so hard I cried
1,I watched this movie only because I didnt want to leave my 9 yo and her friend in the theater by themselves Honestly I went in expecting to enjoy a good nap  but found myself entranced by the movie Id recommend it to anyone who asks Roys mom was on one of my alltime favorite TV shows years ago playing a mermaid Maximum Bob She was really cute in this movie The three main characters were all excellent young actors Also enjoyed seeing and hearing Jimmy Buffet The movie itself was quite beautiful  showcasing some of what makes Florida so great Im glad I ended up going to this movie And to think I was disappointed that I couldnt take them to see Stick It  I think this was MUCH better
1,I had the privilege of being one of the Still photographers on the set of Grand Champion and enjoyed every minute of the 42 days I worked on the movie I have been in the Photography business for 25 years and have worked on 16 movies and I cant think of a time when I enjoyed providing my craft more The Kids were wonderful to work with and little Emma Roberts has so much energy shes a real trip She even grabbed one of my camera during the stockshow scene rehearsal and started shooting Some of her images were used for PR I could have made more money working for a production with a bigger budget but I doubt I would have had the fun and been around so many great actors and the great people of West Texas as I was
1,Like in a circle the movie leads back to its point of departure the image of the cranes that are crossing a Muscovite sky They represent the freedom to realize your life as you wish in order to aspire the greatest possible fulfilment In the beginning Veronica and Boris experience such a promise of happiness and their eyes follow the path of the cranes in exhilaration It seems as if they might be able to live according to their dreams But Man is not a bird Life draws up its own rules from which no human can escape and which we cannot change  not even by making a supreme effort War breaks out and without much hesitation Boris signs up for the front in order to fulfil his patriotic duty He cannot even say goodbye to Veronica for she arrives late at the assembly point from which the soldiers are sent away Surrounded by a jubilant crowd all her attempts to attract Boris attention must inevitably fail Boris eventually gets killed in war without Veronica learning about it for the moment His brother Mark a vigorous musician who obtained the exemption from military service by corruption is eager to take his place Veronica initially resists but in a frightful night of bombing she finally falls victim to his charms A marriage takes place which is never accepted by the family Soon feelings of guilt seize hold of Veronica and she realizes that Boris return is the one and only thing she actually longs for She therefore eases her bad conscience and despair by the selfsacrificing work in a field hospital When war finally is over once again a crowd of enthusiastic people gathers in order to cheer the victorious soldiers Again Veronica is among them forcing her way through a wall of bodies In her hand she is carrying a bunch of flowers until she finally has to give it away to complete strangers for one of the homecomers has just dashed her hopes by confirming the sad certainty of Boris death Once again the cranes invade the sky drawing their wayward lines But now Veronica is watching them on her own and the look in her eyes is a different one She has had to accept the impossibility to live according to preconceived plans to follow the guidelines of your dreams For all humans are nothing but helpless puppets hanging on the inscrutable strings of fate 
1,From the first to the last scene of the movie director Visconti excels at his art to the extent that the movie is ensured to remain as a cultural treasure for only God knows how long It is perfection  as a movie that is but the story has some minor shortcomings Thomas Manns novel is also a perfect piece of art so of course it is impossible to bring into another media Visconti follows the story pretty much and it is only when he allows himself to deviate slightly that the transition falters And no matter how wonderful the scenery is the tension in the air between the characters the hundreds of subtle signals and allegories the almost unbearably heightened serving of Mahlers music  still the minute anomalies in the plot disturb me Maybe Im just a victim of mans desire to flaw the flawless Nevertheless I will offer one example which I regard as crucial WARNING SPOILERS In Manns story Aschenbach eats the strawberries which probably contain the disease that will kill him after giving up his frustrated chase of the boy Tadzio in Venice Unable to catch one delight he settles for another  which poisons him It is very subtle in the book but it is there The forbidden fruit of sorts but more a sign of him surrendering life itself In Viscontis film he also eats strawberries but in a rather insignificant scene by the beach The chase in Venice ends in a much more melodramatic way It works too but lacks some subtlety indeed and also the multilayered symbolism giving food for thought But thats all forgiven when the film allows us to feast on beautiful sceneries faces and constellations and certainly as many other symbols as we can possibly digest  the last gesture of Tadzio standing in the water being the equally sublime and mysterious finale
1,When I was five years old it was my favorite television show I remembered it was on channel 11 at 2PM everyday The shows premise was simple with Carole and Janis as the hostesses of this childrens television show They sang songs and read stories to us as children It was done in a studio with only 54 episodes which was rebroadcasted over and over I remember Sherlock the puppet in the tree The show taught us how to count add subtract and the alphabet For thirty minutes a day now I learned something new with Paula and Janis I remember those days as pleasant memories and now I hope the children of today can learn to love simpler things like hearing stories inexpensive props riding the swings and talking to puppets The set was ideal and simple but it was Carole and Janis who made it worth while while I miss my childhood and those days where the most important thing was watching the Magic Garden Life seemed so much simpler and better Now I hope the kids today enjoy the show
1,I was very moved by the young life experiences of a man who rose so high in the academic world A hard life surrounded by the love of a close family and extended family of companion workers created a person able to succeed in the world For the most part the Hispanic culture is shown as I have always observed and admired  hardworking optimistic and truly family oriented The points of religious superstition were quite authentic to the Catholic church Without a doubtthe actress who played the mother deserves an Academy Award Her prayers for her missing son moved me to tears I will recommend this stunningly thoughtful film to my friends and family
1,This movie was sadly underpromoted but proved to be truly exceptional Entering the theatre I knew nothing about the film except that a friend wanted to see it I was caught off guard with the high quality of the film I couldnt image Ashton Kutcher in a serious role but his performance truly exemplified his character This movie is exceptional and deserves our monetary support unlike so many other movies It does not come lightly for me to recommend any movie but in this case I highly recommend that everyone see it This films is Truly Exceptional
1,I first heard about Commanders Log when I was on the concom for the local science fiction convention Craig Bowlsby Linden Banks Sophie Banks and Brian Oberquell came out to show the video and give a couple of panels on making TV on a shoestring budget I have to say that I was very pleased when I finally had the chance to see the show Comparisons with Red Dwarf are inevitable since the first seasons of Red Dwarf were also shot on a low budget although Commanders Log has to set some kind of record for the least amount of money spent per minute of air time and thus have to make up for the lack of eye candy with good writing and acting Linden Banks who plays Chief Petty Officer Blather does a particularly good job of presenting an earnest but clueless persona Bowlsbys original idea was for the story to be told in two minute interstitials shown in between other shows over the course of an evening although for some reason Space didnt get how cool an idea this would have been and so the interstitials were all rolled up into a onehour show which Space normally showed in two halfhour episodes The existing DVD doesnt include episode 3 which premiered at CascadiaCon in Seattle in 2005 or episode 4 which was previewed at VCON in Vancouver in 2006 but if youre in touch with your local fannish community you may catch news of a showing somewhere near you
1,I first saw this film in Austria when it first came out and I was entranced by it It is a passionate and deeply moving work that should be experienced by all connoisseurs of motion picture art What a shame that it has never been released in DVD format Perhaps one of these days that will be rectified as it would be a shame indeed if one of the best films ever made was forgotten and left to fade away in some film vault forever Why is it that B movies like American Wedding and Eurotrip get widescreen and fullscreen releases and often a special edition with multiple commentaries and extras while great art pieces like The Dead are all but forgotten
1,Rita Hayworth lights up the screen in this fun fancy and delightful musical starring Gene Kelly Rita plays nightclub dancer Rusty Parker who has dreams to be a successful Broadway star Unfortunately her career is getting no where in Danny McGuires Night Club When one of her fellow dancers says shes going to enter a Cover Girl contest she decides to follow her dreams and enters She reminds the publisher of her Grandma who he was deeply in love with many years ago But when she finds this success her boyfriend is not happy about it I had never seen Rita before this and I am so glad I did She has such a scene presence and is a very good actress There are some good numbers in here not the best of any musical but they are melodic and good to listen to One thing I didnt like was Gene Kellys character He should have supported his girlfriend But anyway thats perhaps the only criticism I have about this movie Cover Girl is a glorious fluffy film  perfect escapism Not everyones ideal movie but a wonderful movie nonetheless due to Rita Hayworths star power Great movie truly impressed
1,As I expected would happen too many reviews of this film from professionals and amateurs alike have focused as much if not more on the films ideology Thats because The Sea Inside aka Mar adentro is a film about euthanasia Specifically its a true story about an infamous Galician named Ramón Sampedro who fought for many years for the right to assisted suicide who was denied that right by the Spanish constitutional court and whowell I dont want to ruin the ending of the film for you The real life Sampedro catalyzed a national debate on euthanasia in Spain Now with producerdirectorwritercomposereditor Alejandro Amenábars Abre Los Ojos 1997 and The Others 2001 biopic The Sea Inside another rhetorical aid has been provided in the international debate on this hot button issue But as I keep saying to deaf ears your opinion pro or con on the films ideology shouldnt affect your rating of the film Youre not supposed to be rating the philosophical or political messages that Amenábar wants to make Youre supposed to be rating the film as a film Maybe thats a bit too idealistic as none of us can likely completely divorce our evaluations from our ideological biases but idealistic or not thats the goal So forget about the philosophical and political issues for a moment As a film Amenábar has turned in one of his most elegant and mature works to date He does not focus on societal debates He does not focus on Sampedros legalpolitical struggles He focuses on Sampedro as a man living out his days confined to a bed in his brothers home Sampedro played here in an amazing performance by Javier Bardem was a quadriplegic As the film begins he has been a quadriplegic for 26 years That condition was brought about as Amenábar shows us through marvelously shot flashbacks by a diving accidentSampedro was distracted by a beautiful woman miscalculated the water dove in snapped his neck and almost drowned As a quadriplegic he eventually began writing poetry some of which was published in a book entitled Cartas Desde El Infierno Letters from Hell in real life Sampedros book became a best seller in Spain Perhaps taking Sampedros artistic work as a cue Amenábar has created an elegantly poetic film Most of The Sea Inside is set inside Sampedros bedroom The focus in these scenes is Bardems complex and sublime performance As a quadriplegic Bardem is limited to moving his head and talking He has mastered subtle changes of expression and inflection to convey a deep character with a multifaceted intellectual approach to life Bardem and Amenábar have Sampedro often waxing philosophical in understated speech but theres always a combination of a wicked sense of humor passion for the aestheticincluding music and women and a sadness and even occasionally bitterness not far below the surface Different underlying emotions occasionally break through like waves on the skin of the ocean The people Sampedro interacts with most frequently facilitate this in complex ways These others include his sisterinlaw Manuela Mabel Rivera who has been his chief caretaker since Sampedros accident his brother José Celso Bugallo who is one of the vocal objectors to Sampedros wish to die and with whom there is an underlying unresolved issue it seems like maybe José was the one to save Sampedro from drowning his nephew Javier Tamar Novas who is perhaps the most understanding towards him a righttodie advocate Gené Clara Segura a pro bono lawyer Julia Belén Rueda whom he wanted because she had a degenerative disease CADASIL Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy and would thus by more empathic and who he falls in love with and Rosa Lola Dueñas a local woman who works at a cannery and moonlights as a DJ who heard about him from the media who wants to convince him to desire to live and who falls in love with him The bulk of the film consists of these characters interacting with Sampedro in his room There are also a few other ancillary characters including Sampedros father who remains oddly distant and a notorious and mediaconscious priest Padre Francisco José María Pou who does his best to change Sampedros mind via philosophytheology in a scene often mistakenly characterized as comicit has an attendant comic element but the scene is primarily very serious That most of the film takes place in Sampedros room ingeniously gives the couple significant changes in setting greater impact Sampedros room has a nice big window which he says he is satisfied with as an observation point on the world Maybe even more importantly he regularly imagines the window as a launching pad through which he flies across the hillsides to the ocean which he always loved and which has been the most influential force in his lifeit provided his living when he was younger and took his mobility away Amenábar gives us a fantastical sequence of Sampedro imagining one of his flights to the sea It is beautifully shot with low angles presumably from a helicopter of the hills rushing by until we follow a stream to the wideopen ocean which in this film represents freedom the infinite and natural forces The other significant change of setting arrives with Sampedro finally taking to a wheelchair he otherwise refused them saying they mocked his immobility to make an appearance in court to help plead his case Amenábar gives us a poignant melancholy travelogue shot subjectively of Sampedro viewing life and the world in action from the car window Whether you agree with legalizing euthanasia or not its difficult to deny that this is a wellacted wellscripted and wellconstructed film You may not believe that its a ten and thats even more unlikely if you disagree with legalizing euthanasia but its still worth watching as a fine example of artistic sophisticated filmmaking
1,This first and hopefully not last Wallace  Gromit feature lives up to expectations There are plenty of jokes some a bit cheeky as well as some great tributes to past Science Fiction movies With the barrage of awful and formulaic movies being spewed forth from Hollywood its great to see such a great film like this thats enjoyable for almost everyone If there is any justice it will be top of the boxoffice and be at least nominated for best animation at the next Oscars The animation is wonderful the characters are remarkably expressive and their adventures are great fun This is one of those films that the whole family can enjoy Charming clever fun and well made whats not to enjoy
1,The whole town of Blackstone is afraid because they lynched Bret Dixons brother  and he is coming back for revenge At least thats what they think A great Johnny Hallyday and a very interesting early Mario Adorf star in this ItaloWestern obviously filmed in the Alps Bret Dixon is coming back to Blackstone to investigate why his brother was lynched He is a loner and gunslinger par excellance everybody is afraid of him  the Mexican bandits fighting the Gringos that took their land as well as the decent citizens that lynched Brets brother They lynched him because they thought he stole their money instead of bringing it to Dallas to the safety of the bank there But this is is only half the truth as we find out in the course of this psychologically interesting western But beware its kind of a depressing movie as everybody turns out to be guilty somehow and definitely everybody is bad to the bone Still I enjoyed it very much and gave it an 810 Strange that only less than 5 people voted for this movie as of January 12th 2002
1,I thought this movie was pretty goodOK so maybe it had a few scenes that could make people think of other horror movies but i have seen a lot more pathetic movies that got much higher ratings than this Many movies nowadays are remade to a more modern version and theres nothing wrong with that it keeps the story alive i dont think this movie was pathetic at all and im not just saying that because im a major Chad Michael Murray fan but because i enjoyed it i was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie and my friends and i really enjoyed it and we were talking about it the whole way home I would tell my other friends to watch this movie im not saying its the best movie thats ever hit the box office but its a lot better than some people are describing it to be Everyone has their own opinions so if you really want to know whether its good or bad watch it and then decide
1,Goldrush A Real Life Alaskan Adventure is a great tv film for all ages The movie focuses around Fizzy Alyssa Milano who wants to go on travel for gold in Alaska The only person who hires her is Pierce Thomas Madison Bruce Campbell What comes next for her is an adventure she will never forget This tv film was just great The acting is 1 especially by Bruce Campbell and Alyssa Milano and I also learned some information about the Goldrush I recommend this TV film to all without hesitation It is also based on a true story 1010
1,In this tense and characterdriven romantic tragicomedy we are given an insight into the intertwining lives of four thirtysomething Parisians At the centre is Vinz Cassells portrayal of Max A starryeyed Romeo he falls head over heels for beautiful stranger Lisa Bellucci Encouraged by his putupon best friend Lucien Écoffey in an understated but effective performance he wins her heart and they live happily ever after that is until the scheming neurotic and obsessive Alice the versatile Romane Bohringer becomes very involved in the lives and loves of the other three The rich plot is thickened by a curious chronological jumble and the movie emerges as an intricate jigsaw the eyecandy of picturepostcard Paris at the heart of it all The use of colour does not go unnoticed particularly in Lisas spectacular apartment presumably accounting for the films title where the reds and yellows provoke the fires of passion and lust The audience can relate to Max he truly wears his heart on his sleeve and is constantly punished by irony and circumstance for it In one memorable scene our fated lovers agonisingly separated by a choreographed misunderstanding narrowly miss out on the chance meeting that would surely reunite them Independent of one another they travel to the same destination her on the Metro him in a taxi practically têteàtête Yet fate seems to have it in for them and the audience is captivatingly teased The performances in this film are really what make LAppartement stand out I still cannot understand why Vincent Cassell is not a big star outside France He has presence and diversity in abundance Monica Bellucci Cassells reallife spouse at the time of writing has recently found fame in the Anglophone film industry but perhaps for the wrong reasons  true she is divinely beautiful but behind that is a talented actress who can dominate a scene in classic leadinglady style which many British and American actresses dismiss in favour of the alltooeasy subtle approach All in all watch this film I doubt youll be disappointed It is gripping satisfying amusing sad lavish and a lesson in artistic filmmaking
1,After reading a biography on the last Russian Tzar Nicholas II and his failure to secure the armys support I decided to give this film a try I watched it with a completely open mind not knowing anything about it except its reputation These are the things that impressed me the most 1 The shots of battleships and the soldiers used as extras More than once I stopped to think if this was done in this time and place 80 of this would have been computergenerated 2 The Realism in it From the maggotinfested meat to the shot of the sailor with his candle and the legend Killed for a bowl of soup this movie makes no concessions to the PC cause which thankfully hadnt been invented yet 3 The slow descent into madness of the Odessa Steps sequence From the first shot when the limbless man appears you get the idea something might be wrong since the overall shots are composed though you end up feeling comfortable in your surroundings Then an amputee appears and people start falling in dramatic poses Still the shots are composed until the Cossacks appear into scene and the incredible shot juxtapositions appear This scene is easily worth the price of admission 4 The fact that this movie is 100 unadulterated propaganda Then again when Rambo fought in Afghanistan he also was having something to do with propaganda only a different kind Overall a film marred by a bit of a slow narrative Nevertheless Metropolis The Cabinet of Dr Caligari and this movie are perfect examples of inventive edgy movies that are still remembered for their merits today They really make modern movies look boring and repetitive
1,I got this movie with my BBC Jane Austen Collection 5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations and didnt like it at first Its completely different from the others and it lacks or so I thought one of the qualities that I enjoy in all other Austen movies cheerful common sense The nightmare scene in which Mrs Richards apparently sews her fingers together was especially upsetting I still dont like to watch the fingersewing scene but I do love hearing Mrs R saying dreamily while she sews My only acquaintancetore my gown This movie is now my current Austen favorite Ive watched it 7 or 8 times so far The acting to my mind is incredible The way I notice good acting is when I find myself looking up from whatever Im doing sewing though not my fingers together hopefully or boondoggling or whatever in order to watch the character deliver his lines Its the turn of expression the cast of posture that make the words come alive  thats what makes good acting as far as Im concerned Well I watch almost every part of Northanger Abbey because almost all the actors play their roles with such charisma Peter Firth is amazing as Mr Tilney the perfect blend of Bathian fop and real masculine hero  youre not sure until the end whether hes after Catherines money or not I love his touch of Welsh accent Mr and Mrs Richards are charming the combination of their behaviors  especially Mr Richards high voice lending counterpoint to his wit and wisdom  makes them so real General Tilney as the hardhearted father who may possibly be a murderer is fascinating too And Captain Tilney the grinning rake who is so clearly enjoying himself and the moneygrubbing sister and brother whose names I cant currently remember  the two of them are so perfectly at once smart and smarmy The other reason I love this adaptation is that it is the most romantic of all the Jane Austen adaptations I know this was one of Austens weak points well it is as far as I am concerned even though all her novels are love stories its hard to feel that her heroes and heroines are really in love at the end And if theyre arent really in love then whats the point All the other adaptations Ive seen other than the early OlivierGarson one have pretty coldfish kisses at the end if they kiss at all I dont at all like sex in movies but it really is necessary to have a heartfelt kiss in the end And the ending kiss in Northanger is a doozy The overthetop approach to costumes music and lighting work very well as far as Im concerned And the script is extremely clever  the way we are educated about Gothic romance highlife in Bath Cathys normal country upbringing etc is very well done as they usually are in BBC productions Also I like the part when the little black page does the cartwheels And the Marchionesse I think was an entirely appropriate and very clever expository device Some people have objected that this version is the opposite of what Jane Austen intended to do in Northanger Abbey  she meant to make fun of Gothic romance not promote it But I dont think she meant to put Mysteries of Udolpho etc down She was just making the point that you need to distinguish between reality and fiction And this point is made when Mr Tilney chides Catherine in his mothers room Besides General Tilney was a villain albeit a prosaic one That point was meant to be made surely
1,Bounty killer George Hilton smooth Mexican bandit Gilbert Roland whos great and bank representative Edd Byrnes each try to outwit oneanother while searching for a large amount of gold from one of Rolands train robberies that was hidden by a treacherous member of his gang Though not the greatest that the genre has to offer Its still breezy enough with a lot of lighthearted actionfilled fun and a satisfying finale Any Gun Can Play is mainly remembered for its opening gag where George Hilton easily guns down three outlaws resembling Clint Eastwood Lee Van Cleef and Django The next year Hilton and Roland were reunited alongside Van Heflin and Klaus Kinski in the highly recommended The Ruthless Four
1,The movie Jennifer with Ida Lupino and Howard Duff is film noir magnificenceThis is a mostly unknown movie that all film noir fans should seeJennifer was filmed with the most unusual camera angles for that time which made the movie have a surreal like quality at times I love the stark black and white film noir moviesFilm noir in color is not as goodThe cast and script is excellentThe rather creepy music is fun to listen toIda Lupino is one of the best and talented actresses to ever grace the screenI have never seen a production that she was in that I did not likeShe was not only breathtakingly beautifulshe was a fine actressThe first movie that I remember seeing Ida Lupino in was Roadhouse with Richard Widmark and Cornel WildeI never forgot the movieor her I saw her last films like Food Of The Gods and Women In Chains and even though the movies were not her usual fare she was still delightful in them as an actressHoward Duff is always terrific to watchI highly recommend this masterpiece to everyoneI have this movie on VHS tape
1,Roy Thinnes and Joan Hackett are superb in this 1970 melodrama The lush settings the haunting music and plot twists make it a truly interesting film I had seen it when it first came out on TV Once more it aired when I had a VCR but I did not have a chance to tape it Would love it on VHS if someone has a copy Apart from the suspense which is worked in beautifully I feel the story is unique and is pretty much true to the book MRS MAITLANDS AFFAIR by Margaret Lynn I would say that it was one of the greatly overlooked best films of the 1970s out of movies made for TV I have given the film a number 10 rating because it is done with so much originality There is a true pathos and air of romance which has the viewer sympathizing with the culprit
1,As a fan of the old Doctor Who and after the mediocre Fox movie I was dubious of this new series of Doctor Who I gave it a chance though and am so glad I did Yes some episodes arent as brilliant as others but they are all enjoyable and yes Ecclestons Doctor is far from any weve had before but Ecclestons Doctor is just about the best there is His performance is at times comical at others dramatic sometimes completely crazy but always fantastic This and Bille Piper as Rose make this series a cut above the rest Camille Coduri is also fantastic as Roses mum and there is a depth to this series not present previously This series is incredibly powerful especially considering its SciFi I mean whod have thought you could ever have felt sorry or even cried for a Dalek prior to this how many times in this series history have we had moments like those with Roses dad the Emergency Doctor and the You were fantasticso was I final speech I advise anyone whether a fan of Doctor Who or even TV drama to buy this set on DVD it truly is Fantastic Now only 4 episodes through the latest series and looking forward to the new Cybermen I have to say that David Tennants Doctor is just not as good of course you may disagree but I dont think his Doctor is capable of those emotional moments seen in the previous series I also have to say that in my opinion so far this series has not been as good as the last however the return of Sarah Jane  K9 was a fantastic episode a true gem Not to say this series is not good just not quite AS good So whether you like it or not and whether you prefer Tennant or Eccleston The Doctor is back and hes here to stay Fantastic  Almost as many Fantastics as The Doctor 
1,I would be interested to hear from the director Barbet Schroeder as to why he decided to make More his first film and more specifically what his interest in hippies or rather this form of the Eurohippie paradise and about their demise The film is at least true enough to keep one interested but in its own kind of truth its strange biased Its a given heroin aka Horse is awful stuff rotten the conclusion for many a dumbheaded drug user that sees that as the beallendall because it basically is after that everything else stops that becomes the life and its either a continuous run for more of the same or death More starts off as something concerning a romance between a New York girl and a German man but it becomes something else for better or worse sometimes both in the same scene Its basically about two young people Estelle and Stefan who meet in a city where Stefan has come as a sort of wanderer away from his home country Shes wandering too sort of and is maybe too friendly with a bigtime pusher named Wolf They end up on a remote island somewhere nearby and after a somewhat daring grab for some horse by Estelle they also find a pad in the form of a seemingly remoter house along the seashore Schroeders comment on youth and sex and drugs isnt too simplistic which makes the film actually lucid and intelligent so many years later Its both direct and subtle more about the characters and then about the fact that what hes depicting could in other hands just be a propagandistic hippieexploitation picture Perhaps most pleasantly and this is just a guess Schroeder uses as inspiration the sort of long sequence from Bergmans Summer with Monika two kids in an inexorable connection some good some definitely not so good set against too perfectly shot landscapes On the one hand I should mention that there are problems some big ones in fact The performances arent very convincing throughout a few scenes strike some power or have the actors in a good connection with one another but Klaus Grumberg overplays himself even if he is an ornery German by nature in that case I wouldve preferred Klaus Kinski in the part to make it crazier but deep enough for the subject matter as does Farmer to her own degree And theres gaps of naiveté in the screenplay that keep it from being as deep as it really thinks it is On the other hand there are two big things going for it Nestor Almendros the great cinematographer ie Days of Heaven is DP and is a big boost for a first time director like Schroeder Nearly every image is seen with an awesome purpose or artistry be it a shot of the cliffs by the sea or sun or something as simple as the seemingly natural light of a room The other thing is Pink Floyd probably the main reason I and many others have heard of the film in the first place years before I knew really who Schroeder was I saw the More soundtrack whenever I looked up Pink Floyd albums Its very good music throughout occasionally the mindblowing variety that gives them the reputation they deserve Some of it too is a little tedious even as it is a movie that concerns free love and lots of drugs and sometimes both at the same time I wouldnt rank it anywhere near as high as a Meddle or Animals certainly not Dark Side but it too helps to elevate the subject matter another notch particularly when one least expects it or in low tones or floating in and out of buildings as Stefan or other walks on the streets Its almost better atmosphere than the movie itself deserves but overall More is still worth watching as a period piece dated but potent like a less ambitious but more substantial Zabriskie Point
1,Weve just watched the last of the series shown on the SBS network and will miss our weekly dose of Danish Delight My wife and I picked up the show after the Swedish show The Eagle finished and it seemed by comparison to be a very poor substitute for our then favourite show on TV Week by week however the show grew on me and whilst not as glossy as the Swedish show and definitely grittier in terms of their investigations of everyday crimes it certainly provided a very satisfying weekly viewing meal indeed Prior to these 2 shows I had not really been a fan of the cop genre and cant say I am now but the 2 Scandinavian shows really provided us with an insight into life in those northern Euopean countries through the eyes of their special policing units
1,I would like to know if The Outsiders Australian TV series will ever be released on DVD sometime in the future And is the music Title Theme available on CD There was only one series of 13 episodes of this drama and should have gone on to at least three or even four series in total The Young German Actor in the series was also in a German TV series called Black Forest Clinic which aired here in the UK with English dialogue superimposed with the lipsync  I look forward to hearing any comments from TV Industry personnel on the above questions thank you in advance
1,I saw Riverdance  The New Show and loved it from the very first moment It is an energetic tribute to Irish dance filled with brilliant dancing music and choreography The leads Jean Butler and Colin Dunne had me captivated with their exquisite dancing May they always keep shining and keep dancing Their on stage chemistry was amazing and the unity between them on stage was obvious They look like they were made to dance with each other This show is my absolute favourite and probably always will be Long Live Riverdance
1,OK On the whole this three part documentary will bring most interested people up to date with goings on in the world of physics and the last 300 years of discovery of our universe If you have read Stephen Hawkings brilliant book A Brief History of Time and understood it then you might benefit from the visual description of certain conceptswhich i did to a certain extent Greene is bearable but obviously for the sake of the masses tends to explain things in a slighty patronising way This is of course deliberate and will be perfect for almost everyone who watches this series The guest scientists were good no Hawking but i suppose he has his own DVDs  I kept waiting for him to appear but they rotate through the same ones for almost 3 parts very American weighted here with a few Brits and one antipodean I bought the Nova 2 Disc edition NTSC and there were a few inclusions that really detracted from the overall experience 1 The this is brought to you by at the start of EACH part was a necessary evil for the first part but seeing it 2 more times before It was over was very ordinary 2 Cant be helped I suppose but there is quite a bit of overlap at the start of 2 and 3 which had me reaching for the FFW button a few times 3 This disc set was straight from TVie ads what happen last show for those that missed it and frequent goto pbsorg for more  appearing throughout the presentation quite unlike BBC material which is unmatched for presentationPlanets The Blue Planet etc My 710 is based on content alone The niggles were there but I got over them If this had have been done with that classic British accented presenter you know the one it would be a perfect Disc set in my opinion If you have seen this and want morethen I highly recommend Hawkings book  a Brief History of Time I wish it was a movie too Happy viewing
1,I hate to admit it but I didnt find it to be one of Hitchcocks best but nonetheless a riveting climatic thriller In a remake of Hitchocks 1934 movie of the same title Dr Ben McKenna James Stewart  the man who knows too much  and his wife Jo McKenna Doris Day are holidaying in Morocco with their son Hank Christopher Oslen when there is a case of mistaken identity and caught up in the web of an assassination plot The conspirators go to extreme lengths to prevent them from interfering with their plot kidnapping their beloved Hank I found it surprising that Doris Day who I usually associate with Rock Hudson comedies was cast in a Hitchcock film As I was watching it I soon realized that this was more of a family film compared to Hitchcocks other works example Psycho and she had singing ability needed to pull off Que Sera Sera which she did beautifully She was well cast as herself and James Stewart had chemistry which helped make the couple believable In comparison to the great directors other works I believe this isnt as good but it is still a exceedingly entertaining family thrillermystery There is also the added bonus of Que Sera Sera which turned out to be a smash hit for Doris Day Well directed well acted A fine film
1,A must for any die hard Carpenters fans Cynthia Gibb does the role of KC a huuuuuge amount of justice and although the story isnt 100 factual is still a good insight into the lives of both Richard and Karen and worth a watch just for the soundtrack Makes me cry everytime 
1,Cooley High is one of my favorite movies EVER I think I saw this movie years ago on late night TV with my mother when I was little and I thought it was so funny This movie was also referred to as a black American Graffiti Glynn Turman is wonderful as Preach and Lawrence HiltonJacobs is great as Preachs friend Cochise There are some other great characters in it as well and this movie has a lot of humor packed into it From the beginning of the movie where Cochise goes to Preachs home to get ready for school to the sad ending of Cochises funeral this movie is one that will get you laughing all the way There are a lot of scenes in this film that I like a lot The scene where Pooter another one of Preach and Cochises friends go to the zoo with them and gets the gorillas feces thrown on his shirt very gross but funny as well the first scene in the street corner cafeteria the quarter party at this girls house which became a disaster due to a fight and some others are wonderful to watch This movie even has a wonderful companion soundtrack album which is packed with a lot of wonderful Motown hits and artists from the early 60s only 6 songs on the soundtrack were done in 75 while the rest were from the 60s The movie is mainly about two friends who dream about getting away from their impoverished and rough neighborhood after high school but their futures seem almost out of reach due to their innocent joy ride in a stolen car that two other hoods were responsible for and Preachs relationship with his girlfriend Brenda played by Cynthia Davis almost gets put in jeopardy Go out and rent or buy this movie and be ready for a load of comical entertainment Get the soundtrack too It is a lot of fun as well
1,When I started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the Action ChannelI have to say out of all the shows that Ive seen that ADV releasedthis one is one of the best shows of all time I had to see it againand thats when I got my chance I bought the entire box set of this series at Best Buy for my 20th Birthday And I got to enjoy itand see more of the episodes that I missed on Action Channeland the same 3 episodes that Ive seen My favorite characters in this show are SylviaLeonand Nigel The animation in this series was the bestand the hard suits were cool as well But the show also has a great voice cast likeChris PattonJason DouglasChristine Autenand Hillary Haagand more So if you like this show on Action Channelthen you have to own it on DVD Its the bestand you will see what I mean
1,A story about love and hate tragedy and happiness and most of all friendship set in the very interesting time of the American Civil War Gets you interested in history gets you emotionally involved and makes you feverishly wait for the next episode Moreover the casting was splendid Many superstars appear in short cameos the leading roles are played by a big array of talented mimes  Kirstie Alley and Terri Garber should be mentioned here  this is simply a superb example for a TV production as it should be Not to forget the sheer loveliness of Wendy Kilbourne portraying Constance 
1,Its a horror story alright But perhaps not as you know it The real monsters in this flick are humans While the monsters are human and prey As weird as that may sound I see this as Monsters Inc for horror film fans Sure the effects are of a std horror film the monsters are there as in any monster based film the gore is there as well there even is a slasher in the shape of Dr Decker played by David Cronenberg I see flash of Cillian Murphy as Dr Jonathan Crane in Batman Begins here  or is it the other way round And it is Decker c who are the bad guys The monsters want mainly to mind their own business warding off intrusive humans more or less misguided wanting to join there society By the end of the film you actually grow to like the quite little monsters and the dog  not perhaps what you had expected from the first few scenes
1,I love this film dont know why it is called Pot Luck in England  what a rubbish and entirely irrelevant name I spent 8 months in Barcelona not as an Erasmus student but living with other foreigners so it felt just the same It brings back so many great memories of the fun I had with all the friends I made from different countries and of the city itself I really want to see the followup Les Poupees Russes  the Russian Dolls Im guessing it wont be released here My brother saw it in France and said it def wasnt as good but had a lot of the same cast the Brother of Wendy gets married apparently Anyone know anything about this film and whether it may be released
1,this film is wonderful film for students of film in mainstream American film it is common to see stylistic techniques used to draw the audience into the movie in this film the director uses stylistic techniques to push the story forward this is a love story that offers no sex to be honest i cant even recall the characters kissing rather the plot focuses on the emotional ties between the two characters i would not recommend this film for everybody it is not very accessible it is very slow moving and the subtle it is a difficult film and mostly not entertaining i would reccoment this film to people who want to see something different it is a piece of art the soundtrack is most beautiful and visually every frame is a photograph and most beautiful of all its not visually stimulating for the sake of being visually stimulating every frame illustrates a little bit more of the story
1,As someone who was in a PanHellenic sorority I wasnt sure what to expect when I tuned into this show After seeing so many over dramatizations in made for TV movies and the craziness of the reality shows I was curious to see if Greek would be able to show the true College and Greek life experience I was very pleasantly surprised at how the show was able to give the viewer the satisfaction of identifying the everfamiliar characters of this genre but it was also able to add depth to the characters Greek life isnt just about parties and petty conflict Although those things happen within Greek Life they also happen in any other social or professional circle throughout a persons life To characterize it as some exclusive experience to those in a Greek Organization would be false Most of the story lines and situations taking place in Greek can and do take place everywhere in every circle of friends on sports teams in real life But Ive watched both episodes and my little sister whom Im still very close to and I have spent both episodes laughing and being reminded of how theyve truly captured the spirit of our college years and experiences I liked how the second episode showed how the characters struggle with the other facets of their lives school relationships goals etc Cappie telling Rusty that school comes first and going to your brothers for help that was very true to life You cant stay in an Organization if you have bad grades The way Rusty got his assignment to his professor was far fetched but it was entertaining Even the dynamic between Casey and Rusty It happens you grow up and whatever your relationship with your siblings was it changes so you must adjust The bottom line Greek is a great show great entertainment value and enough real life in there to be believable and definitely worth the viewers time
1,I still cant describe what to feel when I received this by the fnac site Such a rare movie so little spoken and known is difficult to find even to fans but the contrast betwen past and present is devastating now I hold a DVD of the movie with the finest quality possible As I did in Atlantis the other rare Besson movie I bought by the internet I saw this one at home with all the lights of my dvd and tv turned off and marveled at the experience I didnt know what to expect Wickedly I always searched some kind of disappointment when I saw a film by Luc Besson I never had seen before But it never came This movie was no exception From the start I understood that the person who makes a film like this as a first feature is destined to be big in the future And so it happened This won several prizes including the highest prize in a film festival of my country which makes me proud and it shows that this movie is preparating many bigger things This may be the most original afterthewar movie I have ever seen beating Mad Max in originality and artistic feel There is not a problem with this movie its cinematography is genius as well the perfomances of the actors I am also proud to say that finally I saw all the movies of my favorite director and have a copy of almost all of them Joan of Arc is still waiting for me to buy the DVD This movie is most of all a work of style and dedication which makes clear why Luc Besson is a director of my choice good taste beautiful framing excellent use of music I also marveled at Eric Serras first featurelength score and the promise of great achievements Gaumont did well to bet in its boygenius the man who would later change the face of Frances and Europes relation between movies and their public Lets hope Besson starts working in a new directorial project I will be the first to cheer it Until then I recommend this movie to anyone who need to learn a lesson of how good movies are made with little money I loved the atmosphere of the movie which by its black and white cinematography suggests us an even more depressed view of the world after the holocaust This movie works by the sheer magic of movies showing in pictures what we cant explain by words And Im with all the people who wrote comments to this movie and liked it good choice A great hug to everyone who sees this and feels that a little of their lives were changed
1,I was surprised Once More My Darling had not generated enough votes at this writing for a user rating Its a screwy comedy I have enjoyed many times over the years Robert Montgomerys mission places him in some very improbable situations and hes just the man for the job He maintains his trademark befuddled look throughout the film and hysterically too Ann Blyth plays his precociouseccentric pursuer who assumes a relationship that does not exist Her character is kooky enough to warrant the unearned nickname Killer but remains cute and cuddly Among the glut of B movies from the late 1940s and 1950s Once More My Darling is a standout This one is worth looking for
1,I dont understand how people could not like this movie You have Gossit Jr the kid who played the main character in Stand By Me Sean Astin and many other great actors Lots of action and fun that you dont see in todays movies anymore Its really a shame  This is an underrated movie that is among other great movies like Lets Get Harry The 80s and early 90s created such great movies that will never again be topped by todays standards  They tried to somehow recreate this movie in Masterminds but came up short with some really bad acting The only thing that movie had going was Patrick Stewart but obviously that wasnt enough
1,Brit director Chrstopher Nolan now has a career in America and a reputation for making movies both popular and critically acclaimed but this small film was where he started And it certainly showcased his talent with its striking blackandwhite cinematography and achronological storytelling that prefigures his later Momento albeit in a less extreme way Thematically and mechanistically the plot reminded me of David Mamets House of Games but the film still feels fresh and sharp right up to the final twist of the ending whose flavour was expected but whose pointedness is unexpectedly delicious The acting on the other hand is not quite in the same class  the film has a stylised quality and possibly to a greater extent than the director intended But its still a fine debut simultaneously claustrophobic and beguiling
1,I saw this movie in the early 1990s when it had been out on VHS for a little while At the time I found it to be interesting and was especially struck by the Ken Russell segment with the visions of the accident victim in triage and surgery Last night at a 2ndrun showing of the latest Indiana Jones movie the vision of John Hurt prompted an unexpected flashback to Aria which I had not thought of in years and the sudden memory of the Russell piece itself was enough to cause an outbreak of tears for a little bit If I can make this observation I note with interest the lovehate reaction that people have expressed to the Russell segment and I have found this interesting difference in other movies that delve into deep trauma and its aftereffects Some GET it others DO NOT interesting I see by the comments and the rating that the overall work hit people in various ways This is how it affected and affects me
1, Fourteen of the funniest minutes on celluloid This short parody is at least as much a part of the Star Wars saga as Phantom Menace and far more entertaining if you ask me Hardware Wars was the first in a long line of SW spoofs which form their own subgenre these days I hate to describe it too muchits so short that the premise is just about the whole thing Suffice it to say that many of the most popular and familiar aspects of Star Wars have fun poked at them Household appliances such as toasters and vacuum cleaners portray spaceships and robots the Princess AnneDroid character wears actual bread rolls on her head instead of the famous coils of braided hair and Fluke Starbucker is even more of a dork than his original if thats possible Ernie Fosselius is one crazy sonofabuckhes also the source of Porklips Now the Apocalypse Now spoof
1,OK so I loved Rachael Ray before but now I ADORE her How innovative I love that she has a cooking section I admit that occasionally I skip that part only because it makes me WAAAY too hungry But I also love that you can get the next days grocery list on her website I love that she has regular helpers and that shes made some of her viewers become her regulars I love how personable she is and how creative she is I also like how she does her Mystery Guests She just seems so much more genuine than so many other talk show hosts She still gets a little starstruck occasionally and I love that I love that she talks about her personal life on there and reminds people how happy she is Shes even mentioned tabloids before and its so funny She also has the funniest stories Anyway Im a fan for life Even my 2 year old knows who Rachael Ray is and he loves her too
1,Cooley High is such a great film that even with the periods sound track urban landscape wardrobe and slangit still doesnt feel dated The sound track by the way is a timeless classic in itself Instead it absorbs you right into it That is a staple of a good movie From start to finish it doesnt miss a beat and I never grow tired of watching it Its ending is unique in the respect that its one of the saddest and at the same time uplifting of all movie endings There may have been a few since Backdraft comes to mind but Cooley was the first and much more emotional
1,This second pairing of Wile E Coyote and the Road Runner is a great as the first Predictable maybe but I dont care and still laugh so much whenever I see it The Wile ERoad runner shorts always had the most special place in my heart So knowing that the second disc of the Golden Collection would not only feature 11 of this BUT they would be in chronological order 2 through 12 the first episode was on Volume 1 made me get misty eyed I LOVE this stuff This animated short can be seen on Disc 2 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2 It also features an optional commentary by Micheal Barrier My Grade A
1,I really felt the movie was ahead of its time The one potential daughterinlaw was such a strong career oriented woman She knew what she wanted and was diplomatic but firm with the overbearing motherinlaw to be The mothers role was played extremely well you just loved to hate her Her need to control her sons lives was neurotically evil If youve ever been in a relationship where youve been judged and found lacking and everybody involved knew it this may hit too close to home Its been years since I saw this movie and I remember thinking that this plot and dialog would work in a 50s or 60s movie It is difficult to watch because of the mother and sons dynamic but I would love to watch it again I keep hoping to find it on one of the old movie channels but so far no luck Attempts to buy it were also futile I dont believe its on tape or DVD
1,My husband received DVD of OBWAT for Christmas and it was the best gift we received We watch it every time we need to laugh and so far we have viewed it 12 timesThe scenery in this movie is beautiful and the music is outstandingWe also purchased the soundtrack and we play it in our vehicles and at home when ever we need a pick me up and that too is dailyIf anyone needs a suggestion for a good gift for movie lovers this movie is itThe characters are hilarious  charming  and their facial expressions are too funny to describeI have always been a fan of George Clooney but now I am also a fan of Tim Blake NelsonDelmar  and John Turturro Peteand am now looking for them in other movies You gotta see this movie
1,Truly a wonderful movie Bruce Willis gives his alwaysoutstanding comedicromantic acting power to this messagemovie and the movie brings hope to the losers many of us know we are A gift to everyone of middle age whose spent time seems both full and yet empty there is more around the next bend and it can be great enriching and romantic Leave the recent past and return to the lessons of the distant past and then take off on a favorite flight to your better future If we could relive our youthful experiences if we could really remember the events that shaped us wouldnt we find a special kind of freedom See the movie open the gift
1,I cant say how many times that one line has made me laugh or how often Ive described that scene to folks not familiar with this film I saw it the year it was released I was 19 I dont think there were a dozen people in that East Village theater that night For years I thought we were the only ones who saw it Nice to see here that others found it as hysterical as I had and see its lasting value despite the time gone by Rent it buy it or steal it a must see
1,This was a funny movie Just having seeing the Evil Dead trilogy not a week ago and left wanting for more I got as many Bruce Campbell movies as I could including really bad ones This one is funny without being exceptional but as sure as hell original I mean youve got mad scientists superhuman cyborgs half brain freaks gypsies ex KGB cab drivers jealousy murders of passion love romance sex action and what more all with the same 6 actors  You really have to see it and enjoy it I cant explain it in a text box I guess it is not so much a cult movie as Evil Dead was but it certainly has that Bruce Campbell touch I love Ted Raimi lends a hand Tamara Gorski looks both beautiful and interesting she has gone a long way from the hooker in Friday the 13th and Vladimir Kolev also shows a lot of promise as an actor although he will probably be cast as secondary character in Hollywood movies his entire career Bottom line funny movie If you liked Evil Dead youll like this too
1,Kon Ichikawa had lived through world war two and saw what its effects it had on his people in Japan But so did novelist Shohei Ooka whose book was the inspiration for Ichikawas film Fires on the Plain Its a film about the men in this war or perhaps more universally in wars in general who lose their humanity The soldiers trudging along through these fields and jungles of the Philippenes in this story are almost completely without hope if not already just that It makes Stones Platoon look like a picnic at least they had certain things like food after all They have little to no reserves or supplies or ammunition no backup no sense of anything going their way in this combat that theyve been thrust into They cant even get some proper hospital care unless if they can no longer walk at all or have lost limbs for example say if you have TB youre on your way But its really through the prism of one soldier a private Tamura that we get a full sense of the futility of war both in its bleak scenes of nothingness and boredom and decay and those flashes of intense and brutal violence In the film Tamura just wants to get some medical care This is right at the start and his told by his superior officer already he is with eyes that stare off and an expression that has been drained by years of battle that he will die if he doesnt find a hospital He doesnt really but does end up in with some soldiers at first with a platoon that seems to sort of have their act together but is really led on by a powerhungry brute who just wants Tamuras stash of salt and then later with two other stray soldiers who are part of a group that had previously been ambushed while crossing a road at night The story isnt entirely a straight line but it doesnt need to be Tamuras path in Fires on the Plain is told in vignettes little stories like when he comes upon a seemingly deserted enemy village Two of the populous comes back to get some supplies and Tamura sneaks up on them Its an excruciating scene since so far with Tamura we havent seen him do anything outright wrong but he does so in this scene not even so much out of evil but out of fear and desperation this is also without spoiling it how he gets a stash of salt Little scenes build up so brilliantly and with devastation like a simple task of finding a pair of walkable shoes which there seem to be none Or when Tamura later in the film discovers his teeth are becoming torn apart and falling out from lack of total hygiene So much for food so it goes It should also be mentioned that this is a hauntingly realized film from Ichikawa shot in a stark black and white view of the fields and woods the cinematography filling everything we see in blackblacks and whitehot white Ichikawa also makes sure to get everything authentic from his actors not simply emotionally but with their own emaciated look and looks of desperation right on them Its as if Ichikawa has to have them all surviving the film as well as characters surviving out in the wild by wild by the way I mean also cannibalism The shock of this is twofold first is the way that a soldier says halfjokingly early on about eating other soldiers to Tamaura who asks if it was true and only in response getting a dont ask word of caution and the second with the depiction of cannibalism itself from the crazy starving man on the hill who pulls out guts out of his lap and says with a straight face to our hero that You can eat me when I die  This makes thing especially more brutal when it comes to the director filming the brief action scenes These are I would argue more brutal than Private Ryan in their depictions of violence in battle the carnage that is completely random A scene I would point to and that contains just a shot that is excruciating to watch is when from a high angle we see a group of about twenty soldiers walking slowly along a hail of gunfire comes that kills only four or five but it just happens so fast and the soldiers just keep walking along at the same crawl This isnt the only shot of horrible carnage thats shown  when needing to be bloody its there but splashed across the screen like something completely of the macabre  but it drives the point completely All of the acting is staggering Funakoshi especially who looks to be both most at peace and most horrified by what he sees in the subtlest of looks most of the time all of the major setpieces provide something else to the gruesome experience and it all amounts to the ultimate question with an antiwar film how can or why do people fight in wars like these Its almost too depressing to put into words and so Ichikawa pushes our noses right up into the muck and filth and blood and demands for us to take it in so maybe some day it will never happen again Or one can hope this by the end of such a bleak and great film as this
1,Christopher Nolans first film is a no budget black and white film about a unemployed writer who begins following strangers which in turn leads to robbery and also violence It is very good Like in his later film Memento he doesnt present the story in a linear way Instead it jumps around somewhat so you end up really sucked in trying to piece it all together and early apparently random shots take on significance as the film progresses This style also means the twists are much more effective Definitely worth seeing if you get the chance especially if you like his later work andor Film Noir
1,This film stands as one of the most amazing examples of compelling and artful filmmaking Ive every seen Herzog seems to capture the almost transcendent tragedy and beauty of Dieters story as well as his endearing personal character By the end of the film I was left wishing that Id had the opportunity to meet Dieter before his passing On a technical note the cinematography is intimate and astoundingly beautiful The narrative is intricately woven with great awareness of the subject and his capacity for reliving and reenacting traumatic events Few documentary directors have so strong an ability to so thoroughly invest the audience in the character This film is a must see
1,I was still living with my parents when they aired this on dutch TV Usually I was the one watching movies with the others not caring But somehow we all sat down and watched this movie This kinda movie used to be aired at Wednesdayevening It is the story of a woman wholl die soon But before she dies she wants to make sure her  many  kids will have the best possible fosterparents So we were watching this and my dad  the most emotional of the four of us started to cry I followed almost immediately and before long my sister and mother were teared up too There we were totally moved by this simple but heartbreaking story If you want a good cry this is the one for you
1,Personally I regard The Egyptian in an extremely favourable light It was introduced to me by a wellknown Australian movie commenter  critic named Bill who was renowned for his insight  broad vision of people  places  particularly of films This movie fitted the Bill perfectly  I came to appreciate his commentary  enthusiasm for this movie that emerged all the more as I watched it as I was literally drawn into it minute by minute beyond his introductory comments on my initial viewing many years ago To me it was propelled layer upon layer within half an hour into an intriguing  fascinating production Yes I am aware of its flaws But it was so enticing  the young man of idealism learning from  inspired by his father  the peasant treated like rubbish in his suffering  the opportunistic friend however flawed but nonetheless loved by his friend the central character Sinute  and to be sure a flawed hero too like so many across humanity of all societies  across all timebut lovable  worthy of love too Yes I believe in a Christian God but too I acknowledge the rights  respect that should be due ANY human being of good heart who would not or will not disrespect the rights of his fellowman without just cause As such I endorse this film  its presentation of a man of good heart  conviction in his belief in the sungod he was devoted to Such people will always be welcome in my world vision and hopefully in many more beyond So too the drama in the ensuing movie I have watched often as surely as it has touched my heart  soul as surely as it seems to have infuriated critics in its era It is captivating watching the struggles  grief  loves of Sinute the physician When I watch it again I am always reminded of my friend in heart Bill the film critic who dared to oppose ALL the critics long ago who rubbished it He added criticism of too many critics  that they make statues to honour stars on the screen or in history but they do not make statues to honour critics And beyond all this I am reminded with each viewing of a SUPERB  TOUCHING spectacle of a beautiful  wellpresented drama that was not just relevant to the 1950s or some bygone era It was meant for YOU  ME across time  place to every man  woman  child  to their personal aspirations for love  freedom  overcoming obstacles to misunderstanding  gross injustice  tragedy appealing to those of simple faith of many religions that it seems too many regard as cause for war Take a night off from invitations or unjust violence from bigotry  judgemental attacks on others injustly executed  consider the merits of this offering Not to the sun god or to power that proves time  again to be so transcient  let this OUTSTANDING movie wash over you like waves onto a beach like the passing hands of time  like life was meant to be And maybe you will find yourself carried into its world of possibilities Lost offerings no more 99 out of 10
1,I cant even begin to imagine why everyone hates this movie so much It had me literally crying with laughter several times I trust you slept well actually we had a bit of a rough night ah the perils of adultery admittedly the ending is a little flat but still has its moments the booger balls obvious fake spalsh as flew into the ocean beach house paradiso personally i think this is the funniest movie ive ever seen 1010
1,Ive been strangely attracted to this film since I saw it on Showtime sometime in the early 80s I say strangely because it is rather a ludicrous bit of softcore fluff a genre Im not particularly interested in The dialogue is pompously and nonsensically philosophical making sense no doubt only to its FrancoItalian producersand the plot completely extraneous What it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood The scenery the beautiful Philippines softfocus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a sort of film making seldom seen today It is truly one of my great guilty pleasures I was fortunate enough to find it on an old laserdisc and have watched it more times than I think is healthy A worthwhile moodpiece
1,The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends says Marion Fairlie who with her halfsister Laura lives in a vast midVictorian country estate And last night I found myself in Limmeridge churchyard Normally people who are dead stay dead just as normally it is the criminals who are locked up rather than the victims But then there was nothing normal about what happened to us And were off on a firstclass Gothic story of madness deception and villainy based on Wilkie Collins great novel of Victorian mystery Its a good idea to pay close attention because there are plots within plots yet they all center on a cunning and ruthless scheme which involves what else money lots of money  Marion Fairlie Tara Fitzgerald and her sister Laura Fairlie Justine Wadell are devoted to each other Marion is fierce and protective Laura is softer and much more romantic Marion has no money of her own Laura will inherit riches when she comes of age Marion has no marriage prospects that we know of Laura has been pledged sometime ago to Sir Percival Glyde James Wilby an altogether too charming aristocrat They are the wards of their uncle a fussy condescending immensely selfcentered hypochondriac Ian Richardson All seems to be quite routine but then a young artist Walter Hartright Andrew Lincoln is engaged to teach them drawing and artistic appreciation And when he arrives at night to the local train station there is no carriage so off he sets out on foot to the estate In the dark woods he encounters a strange woman dressed all in white wandering about and speaking of things he does not understand who then disappears Are we uneasy Yes and so is he and the sisters when they come to realize the strange woman looks much like Laura Later does love emerge between Walter and Laura Does a bud bloom Is there a misunderstanding that sends Walter away and results in Laura marrying Sir Percival Does a canker gnaw And do secrets slowly come to light about the relationships among Laura Marian and the woman in whitedo we learn to be deeply suspicious of Sir Percivals intentionsdo we come to enjoy the style and manners of Sir Percivals close friend Count Fosco Simon Callowand do we eventually realize the foul depths of depravity as well as the power of honor and true love that humanity is capable of Do we visit Victorian insane asylums see falls from high towers dig open graves in the middle of the night and watch retribution arrive amidst the roaring flames of a locked church  Well of course and its a grand journey for us  This BBCMasterpiece Theater program features fine acting and outstanding production values To fit Collins 500pluspage novel into a television show of less than 120 minutes means a good deal had to be cut or abridged and some changes were made most likely to achieve greater impact in the little time available Still taken on its own terms the production of The Woman in White in my opinion works very well as a moody romantic dark television tale Tara Fitzgerald as Marion gives a commanding performance as a woman determined to protect and then save her sister James Wilby as Sir Percival manages the clever feat of slowly letting us see the depraved slime beneath the skin who still has charm amidst the villainy Ian Richardson as the young womens uncle almost steals the show He gives such a bossy and pungent performance it almost unbalances the story every time he appears Perhaps the weakest of the main parts is Simon Callow as Count Fosco The Count is simply a monster yet a supremely civilized and charming one Collins described him as being of immense girth Callow does a fine mannered job of it but to me he lacks a little of the monstrosity of evil  At one point Marian tells us My sister and I are so fond of Gothic novels we sometimes act as if we were in them Little did she know what was in store for herself and Laura
1,When going to see Rendition I was expecting an exciting film on a controversial topic with bigname actors I was not expecting a film that was so engrossing exciting poetic and sad that picked me up from the very beginning and didnt let me go even after I left the theater A word of advice to anyone who hasnt seen it yet dont let your politics come in the way of enjoying or not enjoying this film Take it for what it is I saw this with my conservative Jewish family Im the black sheep the pseudoliberal college student and I thought they would write it off as liberal propaganda Instead they said it was a great film with excellent performances they like to fancy themselves film critics Its sad that a movie like this has to be marketed by its Oscaraffiliated actors while leaving out the constantly underrated Sarsgaard as well as new talent like the truly excellent Metwally The entire cast gave good performances with some standing out much more than others my only problem with it was that there was a lot going on which didnt allow for much screen time for each of the characters In fact I felt like the subplot with Fatima and Khalid was just as prominent on screen as Anwars part of the story The characters all have the potential to fall into stereotypes but the actors do a good enough job to give them depth with the little screen time they have Streep is truly terrific as a heartless senator and as much as I dont want to see the actress in such a terrible role its impossible not to believe her Gyllenhaal who will probably be one of the Oscar nods for this movie seems a bit unsure in his role at times Hs trying to portray his inner conflict but usually just comes off like he either forgot his lines or he doesnt know how he should feel Sarsgaard gave an excellent performance his unforgettable confrontation with Streep is easily one of the best parts of the movie Metwally again was terrific and I hope to see him in more mainstream films Its a shame that Gyllenhaal with probably get nominated before him Yigal Naor as shown on IMDb has been is some films already but he is a newcomer in my eyes He along with Mohammed Khouas and Zineb Oukach all gave great performances The story of Fatima and Khalid was not given any credit in commercials but it brings a sad humanity to the story The narrative was interesting as I was trying to really connect the two story until it was plainly told to us at the end Ive read some comments on here that say the love story was useless but I disagree I think it definitely shows another side to the controversial issue as well as humanity in general Khalid was the real terrorist but he was doing it to avenge his brother and even though he is responsible for the attack you see a humane side to him through the story with Fatima Not that I think we should feel bad for actual terrorists but I think the we are all people theme was definitely relevant Whatever your feelings on terrorism politics etc leave it out of the theater The bottom line is this is an interesting story with a message we all need to hear
1,The trailer goes nowhere near and only scratches the surface of the film and rightly so too not because it has that obligation to keep its real narrative under wraps but because what actually transpires will provoke entirely different lines of questioning some of which are frustratingly not answered in the film leaving you to your own devices to interpret the series of events Which of course means plenty of material for an aftershow discussion Metaphorically the box refers to how us humans tend to subconsciously hole ourselves into situations or things in everyday life and how our enclosed thoughts tend to see things from a certain perspective seldom out of the box Theres a speech made near the end by one of the characters that will leave you pondering over this fact which governs the basis of the entire film and even threading on existentialism where our bodies are mere vessels for the soul and from cradle to the grave we put ourselves in more boxes in a way of life fashion What I disliked about the film is how it tried to sound intelligent through the frequent name dropping of covert government agencies like the CIA and NSA as though theres something overtly clandestine about these agencies that we should be aware of They serve little purpose other than to put every action and every person under scrutiny that nobody can be trusted wrecking havoc in a sense to both the characters and the audience as we try to keep up with trust issues to aid in the interpretation of the narrative Having it set in 1976 against a NASA backdrop of manned space missions and in Langley Virginia also provided that heightened sense of wary that will sap your energies as you sit through it patiently Based upon the short story Button Button written by Richard Matheson and made into an episode of the Twilight Zone the story follows the Lewis family where husband Arthur James Marsden works at NASA and develops a prosthetic foot for his teacher wife Norma Cameron Diaz and youd think its all happy family with their son Walter Sam Oz Stone until one day a mysterious man called Arlington Steward Frank Langella in a TwoFace inspired facial effect whom we are preempted of in the opening comes knocking and giving them a Deal or No Deal button in a box Plunge the button and theyll get a million bucks were talking in dollar terms of the 70s here although a stranger out there will die If they dont well the deals got an expiry date The story would dictate a deal be made which of course sparks off a mysterious sequence of events that unfold with even more shady characters who nosebleed appearing some whom are inexplicably zombie like apparently all under the influence or employment or Arlington Steward Whether or not Steward is Death a clandestine government employee a messenger from God or a representative of Aliens after an anal probe remains unanswered so whichever way you look at it its as if hes delivering something expected just begging that mankind will shake off its innate greed so that his work can be cut short and to return to wherever he came from If you need a little distraction from the disparate scenes which make up the narrative the production sets and art direction are gorgeous in recreating the 70s look as you try to figure out the mystery of the consequences that stem from a result of not fully understanding the fine print Its full circle this examination of human nature of our greed for immediate gratification manifesting its result in longer term pain confusion and further choices that well make based on real sacrifices Nifty special effects come into play as well though it just leaves more room open as to the genre of the film So is it horror science fiction or a mystery thriller Its everything rolled into one actually together with a sprinkling of the philosophical Just dont go expecting a straight narrative film with clean and easy answers at the end  this is like an XFiles episode on steroids
1,One of the last films DIRECTED by Lionel Barrymore Ten Cents a Dance stars Barbara Stanwyck as the dancehall girl Barbara in her sixth role Stanwyck looks quite plainjane in this one and opens with her getting chewed out by the dance hall manager Then along comes rich guy Bradley Carlton Ricardo Cortez who wants to sweep her off her feet Cortez and Stanwyck had made three films together in the 1930s Then she meets Eddie whos very different from the dashing Carlton The writer Jo Swerling had worked on some biggies Its a Wonderful Life Guys and Dolls and Gone with the Wind so I was surprised that the characters and script in this were so ordinary The story starts getting more interesting about halfway thru and is VERY similar to The Bride Walks Out from 1936 ALSO starring Stanwyck TBWO is much more clever but also more tame due to onslaught of the Hays code
1,I saw this in 1993 on a VHS tape but have been unable to find it at any source since This is a very bleak and uncompromising look at the last days of the Japanese Army in the Phillipines Anyone with an interest in the Pacific war would do well to view this film and see what conditions the other side fought underFrom what I can tell this is historically accurate and depicts how easily men can descend into complete barbarism I understand the Japanese Army was completely cut off from any resupply in the Phillipines by 1945 so there is no doubt many of the horrific incidents depicted here happened I might not have been able to identify with the films characters but I appreciate their humanity and struggle to survive If I had to compile a list of the ten greatest war films this film would be on it See it if you can get it
1,A review I have put off for far too long Bluntly 2001 is one of the best sciencefiction films made to date if not the very best Stanley Kubrick was a genius of a film maker and this is one of his very best works And although it is misunderstood by many and respectively underrated it is considered one of the best films of all time and Ill have to agree Back in 1968 no one had done anything like this before and no one has since It was a marvel of a special effects breakthrough back then and seeing how the effects hold up today it is no wonder as to why The film still looks marvelous after almost forty years Take note CGI people Through the use of large miniatures and realistic lighting Kubrick created some of the best special effects ever put on celluloid This aspect alone almost singlehandedly created the chilling void of the space atmosphere which is also attributed to the music and realistic sound effects I cant think of another film where you cant here anything in space like it is in reality Not only is the absence of sound effects in space realistic it is used cleverly as a tool to establish mood and it works flawlessly Aside from the magnificent display of ingenious special effects there are other factors that play a part in establishing the feel of the film The music played all classical compliment what the eyes are seeing and make you feel the significance of mans journey through his evolution from ape to space traveler The story while seemingly simple is profound Sequentially several mysterious black monoliths are discovered and basically trigger certain events integral to the film What are they Where did they come from What do they do These are all questions one asks oneself while watching the story develop and is asked to find his own way While most come away with a general idea of what took place in the story each individual will have to decide what it means to them Any way one decides to answer these question results in profound solutions Its not left entirely up to interpretation but in some aspects it is Experience it for more clarification The end result is quite chilling no matter your personal solution While it is a long film and sometimes slows down it has to be in order to accurately portray the journey of man Its not a subject that would have faired well in a shorter film faster paced feature Those with short attention spans need not apply Last but not least is the epitome of a remorseless antagonist HAL 9000 the computer Never has a machine held such a chilling screen presence Which reminds me for a film with such profound ambition and execution there is surprisingly little dialogue Another sign of Kubricks genius All in all one of the best films made to date and one of the very best science fiction films made A personal favorite Everyone must see this film at least once Very highly recommended
1,The cast for this production of Rigoletto is excellent Edita Gruberova sings Gilda magnificently and passionately Luciano Pavarotti also sings splendidly Vergara is a fine Maddalena Fedora Barbieri is a famous older singer who sings the maid Giovanna Weikl sings Marullo Wixell sings both Rigoletto and Monterone As Rigoletto Wixell is probably the most convincing acting singer in this hardtobeat ensemble of great singers Kathleen Kuhlmann in the Contessa All principals are wellknown and worldrenowned This is an exciting Rigoletto visually as well as musically I have it on both laser disc and DVD You should have it too
1,An introspective look at the relationship between Hawking and the spacetime contingent This film expores the Gallilean and Newtonian laws and there relation to Einsteins Theory of General Relativity The film is methodically directed exposing details of the man Hawking as well as his work Black Holes Interviews with his family are a little too long so sadly there is less development of his theories and ideas  A Philip Glass soundtrack superbly compliments the film Only one other man could compose such haunting instellar melodies Jean Michel Jarre Overall I would highly recommend this movie on the basis of Hawkings nuggets of wisdom and his adequate explanation of an Event Horizon
1,Gary Buseys best performance in a nicelyflowing biography Since had a musical background he was able to do his own songs and it really works Its always good to see that fine actor Don Stroud one of the crickets and Charlie Martin Smith as well An 8 out of 10 Best performance  Gary Busey Thankfully Mr Busey was Oscarnominated for this losing to Jon Voight in COMING HOME A fairly lowbudget flick that doesnt disappoint with GREAT SONGS by Mr Holly I hope this made plenty of dough Busey was never this popular again for varying reasons but thankfully he has this one great one on his resume
1,I cant believe there are people out there that did not like this movie I thought it was the funniest movie i had ever seen It my have been bc i am Mel Brooks biggest fan I know almost all the words and get very discouraged when they censor them when it is played on a Family Channel  this is one of my favorite movies so i dont know why any one would disagree thanks Kristina
1,This is the first sci fi series that I have seriously become hooked on since Star Trek and I havent watched Trek in years It takes the invasion theme in somewhat different directions but has done it in a very exciting way It also borrows from soap opera format where it continues the arc throughout the entire year run of the series The CGI definitely doesnt overcome the plot or the characters except for Nim the fledgling creature who is a pet with definite attitude Anything that would show what he really thought about the neighbors yippy dog is A1 in my book He was a stroke of genius  I am left at the end of the finale asking questions intelligent ones I hope and crossing my fingers and toes that NBC or someone else Sci Fi maybe will continue to run the series and answer those questions  A really great classy show
1,Not since Bette Daviss 1933 vehicle ExLady have I seen a film that was so much better than its star said it was Most of the bum rap Atoll K aka Utopia aka Robinson Crusoeland aka Escapade has got over the years has come from the horror stories Stan Laurel told of its production Given that he suffered a stroke during filming looked like death warmed over through much of it from the opening twoshot of them together youd never guess that Laurel survived Hardy by eight years and was subsequently diagnosed with diabetes once he adjusted his diet accordingly he restored himself to health one can understand why Laurel didnt think this film was the most pleasant experience of his life Yes its flawed the cheapness of the production shows through the dubbing is awful and Laurel and Hardy were too old to do the energetic slapstick of their greatest films But its still genuinely funny and Léo Joannons story introduces elements of political satire sometimes libertarian sometimes communalist one would expect to see from more socially conscious comedians like Chaplin or the Marx Brothers but never from Laurel and Hardy The film deserves credit for being different though its debt to the Ealing Studios classic Passport to Pimlico made just a year earlier is pretty obvious and for integrating the Laurel and Hardy comedy into a rather edgy context completely different from anything theyd used before This isnt a great movie but its certainly better than the eight dreary ones for Fox and MGM theyd made in the early 1940s I suspect only the films technical crudity kept it from earning the cult following among antiestablishment babyboomer youth the Marx Brothers Duck Soup acquired in the late 1960searly 1970s
1,Some films are designed to just entertain you others to make you laugh or cry or uplift others like this aim to provoke to make you think and to make you angry I was angry during this film not at the film but at the fact that it was true that America the free does torture in the illogical view that it is doing it for the greater good The torture scenes in this movie were harrowing the indifference of people was shattering the film was compelling in its argument and showed just how wrong it is to torture people Of course now that makes me a bleeding liberal labels shoved on people by others who shut their minds to the facts that this does happen and should not People who dont realise that as the movie said for every person torturedyou get ten or one hundred people rise up to perform acts of vengeance You get an ever increasing cycle of violence This film did not make me hate America although I can see how it could do but it made me hate the way that America has reacted in its post 911 world There is a significant quote in the film just after we have learned that 19 people have died and seventy five were injured in the bomb scene the quote is one American is dead  that makes the difference You cannot kill an American America can kill thousands but you cannot kill a single American or they will do whatever it takes including torture to enact justice This is the American way apparently Call me a liberal call me naive although I think the people who think torture is fine are naive call me deluded call me anything you like but this film is a brilliant example of what is wrong in America and the west today I wish this film would be shown to all school students at a minimum This film will stay with me a long time part of me wishes I could forget it because I wish this type of thing never happened but I know it does the other part of me wishes I would never forget because we need to remember these shameful events to prevent them from happening again Whatever happens to me this film will be with me for a long time and I will be telling everyone I know to watch it not to be entertained but to be provoked because sometimes we all need to be provoked
1,First dont be fooled by my family name My mother was full blooded Italian so I really know Italian families and I LOVE mobster movies even the funny ones like this For those people who have bad rapped this film you know who you are you should have your movie privileges taken from you because you dont know what good is This is a damn funny and wellstyled film The fact that almost nobody is Italian in it is part of the joke so far as I can see And what redblooded straight male could complain about spending an hour and something with the likes of Michelle Pfieffer Puhlease When I saw this film it won me over with the opening song by Rosemary Clooney who was as Irish as one can get but her pronunciation of the Italian words in Mambo Italiano is flawless and sets the tone of what is to follow perfectly Hell I even bought the record the next day because of it Just the look of every garish thing in the apartment that I have personally seen in my relatives houses though not in the same place which I found hysterical sold it for me This movie is like Goodfellas on laughing gas I just wonder why there are no Burger Worlds and what happened to the food these guys were supposed to get My guess is the crew ate it The Fries are crispy The shakes are creamy My mouth is watering almost as much as it is thinking of the gorgeous Ms Pfieffer And I never trusted clowns anyway And the three best things about this film are Mercedes Ruehls achingly funny mob wife spurned Dean Stockwell as her philandering husband Tony The Tiger and last but DEFINITELY not least the great mugging by Oliver Platt who should get more comic roles And note to myself find out where that black chick went Ouch Why does she work so infrequently This picture is right alongside the great mob movies as it should be
1,In 2023 in a world ruled by the economical interests of the great corporations and not by the people will or politicians Kam Bobbie Phillips is a human hybrid and IBI International Bureau of Investigation agent She is denominated a subfrom subhuman and her genetic composition is 80 human and 20 animal She has a combination of genes of cougar that gives her strength and flexibility falcon that giver her a increased capacity of seeing and hearing and chameleon that gives her the power of camouflage In the first film she was a very seductive and amoral woman using sex to achieve information I do not have watched the second yet but in this third one the story is full of action A group of scientists has been developing a new and dangerous form of power generation for fifteen years The research has not been concluded yet when one of them betrayal the other and steals the research The problem is that due to its molecular instability a black hole will be created and will suck the whole planet Kam saves Dr Tess Adkins Teal Redmann the survival of the team of scientist and tries to retrieve the dangerous invent from the hands of the bad guys There is a very strong sub in this gang that causes many difficulties for Kam This action and scifi television movie is better than the first one recalling The Terminator in some parts of the plot Bobbie Phillips is a very beautiful actress and her outfit is very cool I am becoming a fan of this good entertainment Fans of scifi movies will not be disappointed Now I am trying to buy Chameleon 2 My vote is seven
1,Klaus Kinski popped up in a sizable number of spaghetti Westerns throughout the 60s and early 70s he was usually cast in secondary parts as nasty villains Kooky Klaus lands himself a juicy lead role as Crazy Johnny Laster a foul twitchy and deranged sex maniac who comes up with a plan to abduct a lovely heiress in order to obtain her considerable inheritance Johnny and his gang become wanted fugitives after the plan goes disastrously awry Writerdirector Mario Costa ably crafts a sordidly compelling portrait of a severely sick and twisted piece of sniveling lowlife work the plot unfolds at a steady pace the tone is appropriately gritty and serious and the exciting action scenes are staged with real skill and brio the shootouts in rock quarries are especially gripping and thrilling Ironically dressed in white oozing oily charisma from every rotten pore and jumping on beautiful women every chance he gets Kinskis Johnny makes for a fascinatingly creepy and monstrous brute Kinski is simply spectacular as this gloriously repellent character he receives fine support from the luscious Gabriella Giorgelli as sweet fiery saloon girl Juanita Steven Tedd as the cheery Riccardo Giovanni Pallavicino as ruthless band gang leader Machete Giuliano Raffaella as smart lawyer Gary Pinkerton and Paolo Casella as Johnnys sensible parter Glen Kudos are also in order for Stelvio Ciprianis moody and spirited score Well worth seeing for Kinski fans
1,I thought this was movie was great Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this movie Yasmine Bleeths character plays a women who has fallen head over heals in love with Richard Greicos character They end up getting married and everything seems perfect except Yasmine Bleeth wants a baby more than anything however she has a hard time trying to conceive Richard Greico will do anything to make her happy and will go to extreme measures to make her happy I thought the acting was great in this movie and it keeps you guessing It shows how naive one can be when they have fallen in love Yasmine Bleeth is a good actress in this and I wonder why she never made it further in her career Richard Greico is very impressive as the deceiving husband and plays the evil part very well I wonder why certain actors make it and certain ones dont All and all a great movie that I would recommend
1,This is one of my favorite Capraesque comedies This movie is just meant to be enjoyed not deconstructed microscopically analyzed Its not religious commentary Its fun Its fantasy The surprisingly negative comments IMHO reflect a level of expectation that professional film critics have led us to think must be a part of every movie Others have described Travoltas role its the reason youll watch the movie over and over and the excellent supporting cast including Sparky Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar sometimes a movie is just fun Enjoy
1,This is a betterthanaverage entry in the Saint series  It holds your interest and as mysteries should keeps you guessing until the end and has several suspects to choose from Many films from the Golden Age are not for all tastes especially younger viewers They date themselves by clothing cars settings etc Who nowadays asks for a highball Or wears a suit and tie everywhere And the legal process was so much simpler  must have been a dearth of lawyers back then Frankly much of value is missing from those days In any case go with it and enjoy Its good  in an oldfashioned sense
1,Johnny Crawford is great in this movie of a troubled teen coming of age in a generation that was in the middle of a cultural and spiritual upheaval Billy Graham does a good job of portraying life in this sweet sometimes corny but all the way sincere flick He gives us a look at not only the social scene but gives good solid advice that holds true today about morals decisions the generation gap teen dating some of the statistics that are given in this movie are astounding They sound like todays stats Just to see Billy in his younger days is worth seeing Its an awesome movie It made me realize that human nature does not change even though hair fashion and language may change humans are still struggling with the same issues they have been struggling with for thousands of years
1,So heres a bit of background on how I came to see this movie As you probably know this is the original French film that was then remade quelle surprise by Hollywood as Wicker Park Well I avoided that movie like the plague when it was first released simply because a I knew it had absolutely nothing to do with Wicker Park and living in Chicago I didnt see why they called it that  it was filmed in fricking Canada for a start  b I have a very hard time bothering with pointless remakes done purely because Hollywood thinks were too bone idle to read a few subtitles I am dreading the remake of Infernal Affairs by the way and c I cant stand Josh Hartnett nuff said there  However I came across WP on TV the other day probably about half an hour in and I have to say initially it made no sense at all until about half an hour from the end when it started coming together By the end I was really surprised to find myself really into it and then the ending just seemed so good  a perfect combination of story passion and ending with possibly one of the greatest musical choices Ive ever seen heard Since then Ive heard a lot about the LAppartement vs Wicker Park argument and looking at WP I still say it has bugger all to do with Chicago but there seemed something about it that I liked so when it was on again I watched it again  unfortunately still missing the first chunk Ive still yet to see it and I still thought it was pretty good Heck even Josh Hartnett seemed good But I was curious about LAppartement and wanted to see what all the fuss was about So I waited and waited to catch lAppartement somewhere somehow Netflix let me down so I ended up getting a copy from some website in Ireland And Ive just watched it  Its really kind of weird but a good weird A classic French film Great acting Romane Bohringer is an absolute gem  sorry but she acts Monica Bellucci off the screen in every scene Vincent Cassel was a weird choice for the lead but by the end he works And Ive seen JeanPhilippe Ecoffey in a lot of movies and I just love him  the scene where Alice dumps him in the restaurant and he just looks like someones told him his puppys been run over was excruciating But I can honestly say having seen WP and pretty much expecting that to have been a scene for scene copy as about 75 of the rest of the movie had been  maybe in a different order but come on the scene with the coffee in the glasses Word for word you can imagine my surprise when I watched the ending of LAppartement I can literally say I was blown away  hmm a bit like poor old Lucien was through the cafe window really So be prepared if youve seen Wicker Park and you fancy taking a look at the original like I did do not make the mistake of expecting an identical movie because youll either be disappointed or exhilarated at a piece of French movie history  a prime example of how you can watch a movie think youre going to watch a pithy happy ending and get whiplash from the total spin in the opposite direction right at the end Definitely catch this movie Oh and while youre at maybe not too near the same time but down the road take a look at Wicker Park itll surprise you too
1,This is a great documentary and above comments make a brief summary of how great it was so I wont repeat the same compliments But Faith akin being an Turkish oriented guy who probably knows about that country more than an ordinary European falls into the trap of orientalism that other western artists usually fall But come on man you are Turkish blooded and your movie could be deeper and could describe whats beyond beyogluold town Its a missed opportunity for Akinfor that reason Performances by Muzeyyen Senar and Orhan Gencebay are peek of the movie and Ceza a very talented and bad ass Turkish rapper makes some trash talk about American gangsta rappers which I totally agree I will recommend this movie to my American friends
1,It was an interesting and entertaining movie well worth watching The acting was decent but it may be out of date for some people I was glad to see cast members of such highly acclaimed movies as Raging Bull and Goodfellas in this movie A great and dramatic ending and pretty good writing
1,A unique blend of musical filmnoir and comedy  with a few sex scenes thrown in for good measure The only other film I can think of with a fairly similarly wild and madcap mixture of themes and clichés is the French movie Billy Ze Kick  but that has a more surreal and quirky approach Not that this film would not be surreal or quirky The humour is at times quite subtle at other times blatantly in your face  and often crossing the border to offensiveness To give an example in the postcoital chitchat with a prostitute our hero Max Müller encourages her to reveal who was responsible for a recent murder using the words Schiess los Literally this phrase means Shoot in German and that is exactly what a hidden assassin does in response In other words  this beautiful lady was sacrificed for a pun Müllers Büro is also one of the very rare examples of films with funny sex scenes Larrys romance is accompanied by the song Ich will mehr I want more  while the song perfectly underpins the action the meaning of its words changes a couple of times hinting at the end at Larrys inability of providing any further service The films main love scene between Max Müller and Bettina Kant lacks such subtlety  this is jawdropping stuff especially when Bettinas singing slowly transgresses into moaning of course all in the rhythm of the music Unmissable unless you are one of the easily offended
1,Even if I had never seen or heard of Georgetown CO this would be a sweet little movie But my dad was born and raised there and those are my uncles horses you see pulling the sleigh So this movie is very special to me A lot of the interiors are shot in buildings and houses I recognize and are very realistic The story is a little hokey but Georgetown is that kind of magical place where things like that COULD happen John Denver was a better actor than a lot of people give him credit for Mary Wickes plays the kind of commonsense lady with a lot of sass she played so well in many other films most notably White Christmas I usually dont get to go out there in the winter so I like to see this movie at Christmas time to tide me over until my next trip
1,Thus starts One Crazy Summer the evil twin of Better off dead How can any movie be bad when the opening lines are sung by David Lee Roth This movie is a total blast Pairing again John Cusack with Curtis Armstrong but this time adding Bobcat Goldwaith to the mix has great funny results Hyperactive Bobcat grates the nerve of everyone around Curtis Ak Ak is the son of a deranged military with pacifist tendencies and Demi Moore with natural breasts wow as the love interest of once again chronically depressed Cusack The story is well simple enough The laughs are there but both Savage Steve Holland films have a certain quality to them they are funny but they are also sweet The scene where Curtis finds a blown up doll in the target practice beach and begins musing about how a little girl wont be able to sleep was dumb funny and touching The animation used throughout is quite surreal The Boat is hysterical complete with Watsamatta U sail and Odie plush doll Overall a fun film though not as good as Better off dead
1,The old dark house subgenre that dominated the early talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we review the oldies today Here is one that provides so very many suspicious characters you have to wonder how they will be able to tie up all the loose ends in the 6 reel running time The Crooked Circle is a gang of counterfeiters and thieves who have decided to take revenge on Col Walters Berton Churchill who has sent one of their ranks to prison They decide he must die that very night Meanwhile the Colonels own group The Sphinx Club is determined to protect him at all costs This does not sit well with Thelma Irene Purcell fiancée of club member Brand Osborne Ben Lyon late of the megabudgeted HELLS ANGELS 1930 who wants him to quit the club and stop endangering his own life Brand promises to resign after saving the colonels life Everyone heads off to Walters newly purchased mansion on Long Island to await the assassin The Colonel might be the new owner of Melody Manor but its an old dark house complete with eccentric neighbours like Raymond Hatton as a local hermit and maybe even a ghost Top billed Zasu Pitts is Nora the housekeeper who expects to see a spirit around every corner Throw in a cop James Gleason who is certain Brand is a criminal and we have a picture which is packed with action and surprises You will notice right away that the script writer was at a loss to come up with too much dialog because a lot of characters repeat the same lines over and over Yoganda C Henry Gordon a Hindu mystic which movies of that time were loaded with says Evil is on the way many times and I lost count of how often Ms Pitts says Something always happens to somebody There are many suspects and two characters Mr Gleason as the stereotype dumb cop and Roscoe Karns as Mr Lyons pal who serve as comedy relief The house itself is appropriately spooky looking in fact I think the same set was used in THE PHANTOM 1931 with lots of secret passages and violin music coming out of empty rooms but somehow you never really get a feeling of danger Maybe its because no one in the movie and I do mean no one is entirely what they seem to be It all comes out right in the end though but to go into any more detail would spoil it for you Watch carefully for Robert Frazer from WHITE ZOMBIE and Frank Reicher best remembered as Capt Engelhorn from KING KONG to pop up among the suspects THE CROOKED CIRCLE is a fun film Some aspects of the plot are predictable and then again several others are not I suspect you will enjoy it
1,My only problem with The Curse of the WereRabbit is that the movie does not take the time to properly introduce Wallace and Gromit to those not familiar with Parks short films Strangely A Close Shave manages to do this with a lot less time to spare Still I loved seeing the boys back in action and loved all the new characters human and otherwise I especially loved Ralph Fiennes voice as the scheming Victor Quartermaine It is also interesting to see the series on the large screen The workmanship with the clay characters really stands out Its a hoot and great for the whole family I buy very few DVDs but I have every Wallace and Gromit and will happily add this one
1,Giant Robot was the most popular Japanese TV serial ever seen on Indian TV It was targeted to children and we saw a robot for the first time in our life  Many Indian children must have even seen a machine for the first time outside the school textbooks  The serial also showed a child in an adults organization fighting evil No doubt many of us who have seen Giant Robot in our childhood long for our own robots and as a stopgap arrangement look upon our computers in the same way  This show also portrayed ideal adults referring at Jerry Johnnys buddy friend and Unicorn chief Azuma We grew to respect Japanese progress and still view Japan as the ideal Asian nation BTW at that time there were no satellite TV channels in India and the govt owned broadcaster did not show much of Disney cartoons I guess that was how child serials like giant Robot got appreciated Nowadays there is Pokemon etc but they are no so fascinating or alluring as Giant robot
1,The movie is excellent Acting cinematography direction and music are spellbinding It seems to me that the reason so many give the movie a low score is because of the devotion they have to the original 1937 version starring Ronald Coleman That movie  for good reason  engendered an unbelievable level of commitment From talking with people who saw the original when it first came out I believe the impact was something akin to the first Starwars movie in modern times I have seen it It was and is wonderful But that does not mean that this version is not also worthy From the first scene the 1973 version grabs you The noise and tumult are fantastic especially in they way they prepare you for the peace of Shangri La And Burt Bacharachs music is beautiful So  by all means enjoy the 1937 version But do not let it detract from your enjoyment of this 1973 version any more than you would let the 1935 King Kong destroy Peter Jacksons of this year
1,When I went to the cinema I expected not much I knew nothing about this movie but it was the only movie I could see cause I was in a small town then So I saw this movie and I was fascinated La stelle che non cè is a trip through the new industrial China and it shows it honestly You see most of the time the ugly places of China and you see what really happens with this new industrializing The main characters are sad but hopefully people Hes the naive Italian guy who cant believe what he sees Shes a translator from china whos missing her son Sometimes sad sometimes funny but every time poetic A wonderful movie with wonderful actors So only one star is missing
1,Hair is one of my favorite movies of all times Even not being part of my generation I already watched this movie 9 times and I cant get enough with the beautiful message of understandingpassionbeauty and love This movie is against the Vietnam war and shows how people should be united independent of the colororigins religions and classes I love the characters Berger and Woof and I think Central Park of the 70s one of the most beautiful places I already saw in my life By the wayI still have this music in my mind When the moon is in the Seventh House And Jupiter aligns with Mars Then peace will guide the planets And love will steer the stars This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius The age of Aquarius Aquarius Aquarius Harmony and understanding Sympathy and trust abounding No more falsehoods or decisions Golden living dreams of visions Mystic crystal revelation And the minds true liberation Aquarius Aquarius ps I am surprised to see that the director of this movie is the same director of AMADEUS I just love both movies
1,It is the best film i have seen in the last 5 years Surely it will be in the same row with such masterpieces as The Platoon Apocalypse Now The Doors The Dogs Heart Russian film Really the play of the boy and his parents is so good that you cant even say that they play No they LIVE as if it was happening to them Notice the smile on there faces when the main hero agrees to go for a walk with them The hate and love in one piece And the final scene Really im still under impression of that film Its very hard even impossible to combine the humor and the tragedy but if you succeed and Frederikson did the impact would be twice strong I compared it with ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOOS NEST I like this film either and the novel itself is good too but after Frederiksons movie it seems simple the same difference I noticed after i watched the film American history X and ROMPER STOMPER  the latter is deeper I mean Milos Forman only showed the material point of view of the problem You watch it then you say Yes its a good film i like him i dont like her and thats it But Angels leave you a wide base to think There are no bad and good boys in the film Cause each of them have the right to behave in the way they do Like the girlfriend of one of the patient Of course shes young and is pregnant and that is a problem for her that his husband is in the clinic but the feelings and emotional experience of her exfriend are even stronger the result is his suicide Why ask him what have he done Arent you insane yourself to ask Why do not support him help him understand him Finally it is even funny when those people talk to each other They say genius things There are a lot of things I would like to say about this film but im not so good in english But im sure those of you who have watched the movie understand me Good luck 
1,I am 17 and a biased Muppet fan and while I love Treasure Island Christmas Carol and Great Muppet Caper The Muppet Movie absolutely deserves to be up there with the best of them It is enormously entertaining thanks to the snappy script by Jerry Juhl and the film looks lovely with some beautifully staged musical numbers Speaking of the songs I really liked them sure they arent the best song score out of the Muppet franchise but they were very nice to listen to especially Never Before Never Before is now one of my favourite Muppet songs along with First Time It Happens and Professional Pirate The Muppets as usual were fantastic particularly the always delightful Miss Piggy and the chemistry between Kermit and Fozzie was great And what a brilliant human cast from Bob Hope to Orson Welles from Madeleine Kahnthe same wonderful actress who brought us hilarious movies like Whats Up Doc Blazing Saddles and Clue to Cloris Leachman from Steve Martin to Richard Pryor all of whom made memorable guest appearances if careful not to overshadow the Muppets in a fantastic film 1010 Bethany Cox
1,I enjoyed this film which offers a variety of interesting subplots and complex lovehate relations along with interspersed action scenes and some lighthearted moments in which the mountain men counter harsh army discipline All the main characters are well cast True John Wayne or Robert Mitchum could probably have done the starring role just as well but Victor Mature certainly comes across as a headstrong brawling Tarzan of sorts Reminds me of his film role as Samson another difficult but not impossible man to tame The mountain men in the opening scene are certainly an anachronism as the era of pure trapper mountain men pretty much ended 20 years before with the collapse of western beaver populations as well as the fashion market for beaver pelts This story supposedly takes place in Oregon just before the end of the Civil War Judging by the volcano in the background of the opening sceneprobably Mt Lassen the fictional fort was located somewhere in a remote section of the Cascades as we never see any other civilians However there is plenty of conflicting evidence that it actually takes place in the mountains of Wyoming or Montana Red Cloud the war chief who threatens the trappers and soldiers in the fort is the namesake of a very famous Sioux war chief who led a very successful campaign in 186566 to exterminate the newly built army forts in Wyoming and Montana Fort Laramieeastern Wyomingis mentioned as being not too far removed from the fictional fort The plains tribe of Assiniboines is mentioning as joining Red Cloud This aspect of the story then bears a general resemblance to historical fact It may be of interest to note certain resemblances between the plot of this story and that of John Fords Fort Apache In both cases we have a fort commander who was recently assigned to his first frontier post with Native American problems He underestimates the military prowess of his adversaries regarding them as little more than cannon fodder to promote his career In both films he pays dearly for his inexperience in dealing with the enemy Also in common the greenhorn commander resents a subordinate who has long experience with the local Native Americans and wants to tell him what is wise to do and not to do In both films we have a budding romantic relaionship between a woman very close to the commanders heart and a subordinate which the commander does everything to squelch Clearly the commander must be eliminated to allow these romances to proceed to completion I also see certain resemblances with The Misfits The soldiers as a whole including the commander are misfits of a sortas one of them admits mostly they have problems or are raw recruits with no experience fighting Native Americans The commanders wife apparently is the only woman in or anywhere near this fort thus is inherently a misfit with a husband who is very uncertain of his future in the army The trappers in turn are also misfits not really wanting to accept army or civilian discipline yet cut off from their previous free spirit lives by the recent armygenerated antagonism by Red Cloud  Finally we can also compare this story with Anthony Manns later film The Far Country starring Jimmy Stewart In Stewarts case he can choose to return to being a loner cowboy at the end But Matures character doesnt come up with an appetizing new way of being his own boss Red Cloud has made life outside of the army in this region too dangerous to contemplate Besides he has an obsession with the Commanders wife
1,i LOVED THIS MOVIEE well i loved the romance part with COlby and the girlRachel  4got her namei honestly was only interested in those too i loved them in the movie i want to see more movies like that but please no more sad endings where they cant be 2gether  it made me cry but the romance between them the plot the trauma everything was great  i just was more into Colby and Rachel ha ha  everything about this movie was thrilling the kind to keep you glued to your seat because i sure was Honestly my only personal want would be more focused between the couple Colby and Rachel and at least a decent ending I hated the ending a better one could have been more thought out not the fact of forcing COlby to his death and Rachel having a son The ending would have killed the movie
1,I saw this series on PBS in 1980 in college and I still cant get it out of my head although I have never seen it since I remember every cast member the casting WAS perfect as mentioned in other comments the design the lighting and of course the story which is by itself is enough to keep you glued to the set Probably the best TV series I ever saw next to the original Roots
1,Its rare that I get the opportunity to review a film for IMDb that relates to my own life in such a close way However as someone living with cerebral palsy albeit less severe than Michael one of the main characters in the film I dont wish to give this film a free pass just because it tackles a subject thats rarely approached and when it is is normally treated with pofaced seriousness There WERE minor problems I had with the film and Id like to address those first so that people are clear that it isnt my situation which has clouded my judgement of this overall excellent film   Parts of it I felt were unashamedly crowdpleasing at the expense of realism If I had a pound for every time a wellmeaning member of the public has mentioned electricwheelchair racing to me Id be much the richer man but speaking personally that fits more into the public perception of how we deal with our disadvantages rather than the reality of what actually goes on Same thing with spending time watching disabled people go to the pub  its not a big deal to those of us who actually do it as much as it might be admirable for outsiders looking in I appreciate that this is from the previously sheltered perspective of Michael but I still think hed be concentrating more on enjoying the experience rather than reflecting on what a big deal it was that he was actually there in the first place As such the amount of time we spend seeing them have fun felt like a bit too much  I felt that the terminal nature of Rorys illness was brought to our attention far too late meaning that it was just used as a cheap sentimental device to come between the pair rather than something everybody knew all along was going to have to be dealt with To balance those criticisms I have to dish out a heap of praise as well Although I thought some scenes showing them getting to grips with normal life were a touch overdone the script also ventured into some tricky places I wouldnt have expected and comes out with a lot of credit for doing so For instance raising the issue of love and relationships and showing the daily apparatus often used to aid and assist the lives of non ablebodied people Also despite the blunt emotional shock tactic of death being sprung upon us the movie as a whole is far less sappy than anyone has a right to expect these type of films to be Brenda Fricker can and has been performing variations of her role capably on autopilot for what seems like years but Robertson and McAvoy share a special interaction that must be noted Inside Im doing cartwheels that a group of people somewhere have finally made a film doing justice to the lust for life of many disabled persons
1,Wesley Eure is young inventor Brian Foster whos invented a new crime busting security device in the form of a robot dog the titular CHOMPS It stands for Canine HOMe Protection System CHOMPS whos been modeled after Brians real dog Rascal can do just about anything hes got enhanced speed strength Xray vision and the like Its just the thing to save his boss Ralph Nortons Conrad Bain security company Naturally a slimy competitor Gibbs Jim Backus wants the edge so he tries to get his hands on the secret This is the kind of thing thats just too hard to resist Its got plenty of slapstick Chuck McCann and Red Buttons play a great pair of bumbling idiots an upbeat attitude an engaging cast and enough good laughs to keep one entertained The energetic discostyle music gets repetitive but is undeniably catchy the story is straightforward and the dogs themselves are absolutely adorable In one thoroughly odd but sidesplitting touch theres another dog in the film named Monster whose thoughts we actually get to hear both his dialog and the performer doing the voice are priceless In fact he even utilizes some mild profanity and his last words end the film on a positively gut busting final note Eure and the cute Valerie Bertinelli are very likable young leads and their veteran supporting cast plays the material with all the gusto they can muster Larry Bishop Hermione Baddeley Robert Q Lewis and Regis Toomey also costar A rare theatrical liveaction venture for the cartooncreating team of Hanna  Barbera The Flintstones ScoobyDoo The Smurfs and so on CHOMPS is agreeably silly stuff I know it left me with a smile on my face 710
1,Anne Christie was Garbos 14th film and the first in which her husky Swedish voice was heard She plays the lead character Anna who has struggled with being abandoned by her father Chris a drunken barge owner played by George F Marion and with the misfortune of the life she has has to lead to keep her head above water Meeting Irish Matt Charles Bickford may mark the turning point for her  or does it Garbo looks and sounds great in this drama which although looking rather clunky and moving at a slow pace still manages to interest and engage an audience nearly 80 years later Marie Dressler makes an impact in the role which gave her a second flush of movie success in films such as Min and Bill Dinner at Eight and Emma while Marion and Bickford are more than adequate An interesting slice of movie history Garbo would do better talkies in the years following but Anna Christie will always be remembered for the first time she talked on screen
1,I have seen most of the Tarzan episodes Certainly the rated X with OKeeffe  Bo Derek which is totally deplorable I have seen this version several times since it was originally shown All the cast had memorable parts great acting the Ape sequences Last night I viewed same on Spanish station and other than some French dialog all in Spanish As far as Hudson not wanting Andies voice he did nothing until the very end He viewed the dailies and could have hired a dialog coach It seems silly that a story about apes and a man raised by them all speaking gibberish that Hudson attacked AndieThe story line in the movie was that she was an American cousin The last time I checked Carolina was in the USA She was beautiful in movie and her eyes and gorgeous hair alabaster skin mystified all us males She did not have to resort to Bos level She has remained a LADY throughout the rest of her career and should look at this movie half her life agoas a starting point Her performance sincerity made this movie enjoyable believable that a half wild man could ascertain her inner beauty Great sending point for Sir Richardson he did steal the movie
1,Ever since Midnight Cowboy I have been on the lookout for films with Dustin Hoffman and have mostly not been disappointed Ever since Kramer vs Kramer I have been on the lookout for films with Meryl Streep and have mostly not been disappointed She gave a superb performance really one of her best in Sophies Decision and I lapped her up in Out of Africa That these two actors came together over 20 years ago for Kramer vs Kramer was definitely a very good idea the result is an excellent character drama with a theme which is still very relevant in todays society On divorcing everyone has a pretty bad time though the kids seem to suffer mostBeautifully handled by Robert Benton in some original directing presenting some memorable scenes even the passageway takes on character and should be included in the cast And as for the breakfast scene with Billy Justin Henry just simply magnificent Just how do you get an eightyearold to act Benton managed it and of course with Hoffman there seemed to be good electricity the result is certainly engaging endearing and convincing Justin Henrys performance must rank among the best 5 or 6 kids performances of all time The best thing once again was the naturalness there was no going over the top so frequent these days This film came up again on the small screen the other night though I have had it in my video collection for years it is still worth watching and paying attention to everything Around 7½ out of 10
1,Before seeing the sneak preview today of Angels  Demons I cleared my mind of any uncertainties that might hold me back from enjoying it the enormous amount of hatred towards Dan Brown the fact that it was written by Dan Brown and because Dan Browns name is slapped on all of the posters I went in with an open mind and expected the worse but instead what I got was a 2 and a half hour Roman cat and mouse game with Forrest Gump and that is by all means good entertainment value The movie hangs loosely on the actual novel itself Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon Hanks jets off to Rome after the Popes sudden death and the reelection through Papal Conclave Arranging all of this is the carmelengo Patrick McKenna McGregor However he soon learns of a new threat one that involves a secret brotherhood making its presence known an antimatter time bomb that Vatican City is now targeted with and the kidnapping of four cardinals Langdon using his intellects and trust me youll be hearing a LOT from it is given the task of finding and rescuing them using the mysterious Path of Illumination Aiding him on the quest is CERN scientist Vittoria Vetra Zurer who is also the cocreator of the antimatter  The movie itself runs at an uneven pace One minute Langdon and the Swiss Guard are speeding to save a branded cardinal the next minute he bores you with pointless information about every random object he passes evidently slowing the books much anticipated actionthriller sequences down It makes for an interesting read on paper but on screen it can go either way  The characters are decently written onto the big screen Ewan McGregor does a convincing performance as the quiet but knowledgeable Patrick McKenna famous accent included Tom Hanks is slightly more agile intellectually and physically since his last performance in the mediocre Da Vinci Code Stellen Skarsgard plays Commander Richter the straightfaced leader of the Swiss Guard Unfortunately neither his nor Ayelet Zurers performance are worthwhile ones and instead of playing a part in the story they are just kicked aside as assets  However Angels  Demons accomplishes what DVC could never a thrilling fastpaced movie filled with satisfying explosions beautiful recreations of St Peters Square and Basilica including many of the churches and a pulsing bomb counting down the midnight hour Ron Howard does a decent job at directing this second Langdon adventure this time taking in much criticism and almost completely exchanging the boring dialogue for tense chases almost  While newcomers might call it a National Treasure 3 with a much larger threat there is still enough contagious suspensethriller eyecandy and brilliant still shots of Rome to breathe in Fans of the book might feel differently towards the movies drastic changes but considering the amount of blasphemy and inaccuracy it generates AD does exceedingly well at keeping the viewer locked on to the screen this time rather than on their sleepy shoulder  A good booktomovie adaption that will both appeal and entertain 7410
1,Eddie Monroe is Hooooot He is a great actor and I could be his girl anytime Hes so fine I was so sad at the end Im not going to ruin the end but wow Girls are so vicious His girl was wrong If Eddie was my man I would never disrespect Those Mobsters were spooky The moral of the story is Trust No One Your friends will hurt u if they can Oh and Eddie tell your girlfriend that yo mine she should move ova I would suggest seeing the movie Why Becasur I said so It kept my eyes on the screen My sister loved it also so I am going to see it again because now my friends want to see it and its worth seeing two times PeaceHappy New Year
1,Not bad but could be loads better also seems to follow a staple diet for crime drama Youve got Sandra Bullock as the cop who finds it difficult to work with others youve got her placed with a new partner Theres a closed case but a cop who works on it anyway and theres so many corney lines in the film it makes you want to scream However if you can look past the formulaic elements there is a good film hiding underneath Its gripping and the subplots worked for me Well worth a rent but maybe not a purchase
1,I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie My teenagers enjoyed it over the holidays Is it 100 accurate and is it a little sappy in places Yesbut it took my kids away from the computer and play station to spend four nights watching it all The battle scenes were impressive and we met plenty of historical characters throughout Lloyd Bridges as Jefferson Davis and Hal Holbrook as Abraham Lincoln stand out We all thought Phillip Casnoff as Bent was evilly and charmingly brilliant We all thought Charles stole the show from Orry and George We will enjoy the movie again
1,Mishima  a life in four chapters is in my opinion the best Paul Schrader film to this day Mesmorizing cinematography accompanied with Philip Glass mystical musical score added a completely magical aura to the story of one of the Japans greatest novelists whose originality and picturesque narrative are beautifully portrayed in this picture As any gifted character Mishima was troubled with severe self conflicts the main of them being the conflict between the pen and a sword as the director puts it in his final chapter or the struggle between the sensitive poet with homosexual feelings living in a notoriously masculine society with centuries long warrior traditions thus widening the gap between the sensitive and the militantly traditional side of Mishima himself All Schraders films and the ones he wrote scripts for are basically stories of the inside conflict within a man that doesnt belong in an environment he lives in That also goes for Mishima who apart from Japanese military school upbringing is brought up with love for theater and words His demise consisted of both of these key points in his life it was about words and theatrical ending in a life long play Film like this comes along once in a long while and most will have to wait a lifetime to reach this beauty 20 out of 10
1,They are hunted and starving They are completely demoralized and yet they press on through sheer inertia This film tries to answer the question How far will human beings go to survive Hopelessness emanates from every of this film and like so many japanese films of this time it condemns the blind military loyalty that pressed the japanese people into war
1,I thought this film was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch the bits I missed whilst bending over holding my stomach The critic who reviewed this film for this site challenged anyone with an IQ over their shoe size to find this film funny well my IQ is approx135I challenge this person to question me and then eat his own words This film is brilliant and if the critic above wasnt such a boring idiot he might smile for once in his life and take things as lightly as theyre meant The musical numbers were so imaginative EVERYONE when watching any film about that period of time will notice men in tights and realise how different it is to todays attire and how funny we would find todays male population if they wore tights day in day out The idea of dedicating a song to butch men dancing in tights was so fresh how can anyone NOT laugh Plus also seeing hiphop rappers doing ballet is always hystericalas a dancer also Ive done ballet and hip hop and danced with men whove had to do bothit still cracks me up each time I love this film if anyone hasnt seen it yet dont listen to the critic abovewatch it and then decide for yourself
1,if you get the slight enjoyment out of pink Floyds music you will love this movie the score is completely pink Floyd and of course the drug element plays a major part in this movie giving you the doubts about life within the weakest moments this movie also touches the heart with the story about love and the people around you  there is also a huge connection with the world around you with the environment of a personal islandthis thing tell me i need ten lines to sum up a movie but i am done that is all you get that is why this movie is a 61 which is a major upset to any movie with a score like this take a look at requiem for a dream and the fountain  equally good scores for our generation but overestimated
1,I have realized that many people have commented on the nature of this show being racist and homophobic but I dont feel that is what this show is about The show is about parents who werent ready for kids and are now not ready for teenagers This show helps to bring humor to a very hard topic that is sometimes over looked parenthood Yes we have all had shows that had families in it for example Family Matters Step by Step Family Ties Full Housebut it always would have the same old recipe to its episodes Steph cuts from school and gets caught by her father They have a heart to heart conversation and music is played and its over with a two week grounding that after an aww Dad gets a smile and the show is over Where is the comedy in such a situation Where is the realism With The War at Home you get real situations from a real father type figure Most parents that watch this show hear some of the lines the parents put out and they either laugh cause they know theyve said it or they nod their heads cause they know theyve thought it and never had the guts to say it The War at Home has situations that bring out great comedy as a father thinking his son is gay Doesnt sound funny most think it makes the father homophobic but the comedy comes in the bumbling father trying to talk to his son to open up What parent knows the right thing to say especially in a situation as this I greatly recommend this show to anyone that I know has a sense of humor and especially to anyone who is a young parent or was young when they had kids You relate to a show like this when you are either
1,The success of SCREAM gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave Im happy with that as a big fan of horror and I liked most of those new horror films BOC is a one big pack of horror Colorful fast paced and original I see this movie more like the opening of a new trilogy much like Episode 1 and Aliens Resurrection since it comes up with a new twist Instead of focusing on the little boykiller doll relationship we have here a twisted movie about couples We have the sweet young lovers in contrast with the killer crazy dollsized lovers Very inventive
1,The third part of Miikes Dead or Alive trilogy is as unrelated to the first two parts as they were to each other more or less Show Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi are back again for the lead roles but this time the movie thrusts us forward 300 years or so into the future post apocalypse Riki plays a tough cop an enforcer for the corrupt citys extreme police policies and Show plays a drifter who hooks up with a bunch of the citys oppressed rebels The film must have been shot in Hong Kong as most of the rest of the cast are Cantonese speakers with Terence Yin and Josie Ho being the most recognisable faces Theres also a HK stunt crew on hand for the films action sequences which are very cool in a HKviaMiike style This could be fodder for a dreadful low budget Bmovie but in Miikes hands it of course becomes something more interesting Its quite a slow thoughtful film that meanders along and doesnt try to force anything down the viewers throat Characters are rounded and interesting and the plot an interesting but fairly loose framework for the story to be hung on All in all a fairly low key effort until the action scenes which show Miikes increasing prowess at directing and choreographing very nice action Watching the short making of with Show  Riki in wire rigs is really fun  you can tell they were having a great time  The finale of the film tries to tie together the 3 Dead Or Alive movies which is quite unnecessary because each one is really self contained Miikes explanation of the connection is very funny though and caps the series off quite nicely Not as deep or well developed as DOA2 not as outrageous and intense as DOA1 still another good Miike movie though
1,Im surprised that mine so far is the only comment on this tv movieas far as Im aware the series itself has had a huge following reviewer pundits and real people alike have praised it to a person Anyway let me tell you right away that if like me youre a sucker for gritty police dramas youll like The Lost Child Tennison the heroine throughout the Prime Suspectseries has been battling the male police establishment throughout the series getting to her present comparatively powerful rank in the police hierarchy through hard workobstinacy and sheer talent for police work She isessentially an ambitious career woman but she has a romantic side and is certainly no manhater Unfortunately her relationships are affected by the wicked hours which her career demands and she has never married so when she finds herself pregnant from her latest affair she is faced with the choice of becoming a mother and jeopardising her entire police job let alone future advancement or having an abortion  which she opts for This abortion never looms large in the ensuing drama  its very skilfully dealt with in less than a couple of minutes screentime a marvel of economy in scripting and editing  but its always there as a counterpoint to Tennisons desperate efforts to find another lost child  a kidnap victim  before its too late The story takes many twists and turnsbefore the surprise ending and one is fascinated alike by the plot and characters although I found the many villains a little overdrawn the police and especially Tennison herself are not always competent nor that likeable which figures given the unpleasant job that they have to do in the sleazy underworld which this series habitually inhabits Mirren herself has said that shell make no more movies in the series but excellent as shes always been in the role of Tennison the series itself is as actor proof as is another addiction of mine Dick Wolfs AmericanLaw  Order  whoever appears therein each could go on forever As is my fervent hope
1,The 1973 musical version of LOST HORIZON is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of ALL TIME The 1973 musical remake of the James Hilton novel about mythical SHANGRILA is a real special gem Music by BURT BACHARACH and lyrics by HAL David A strange mixture of straight drama adventure and musical sequences It has the distinction of being the ONLY anti war musical fantasy ever filmed  This film was a critical and financial disappointment in the United States but made a lot of money overseas Only in America did it fail Highly different and unique in its approach as a film musical it deserves far better credit than its given As a story LOST HORIZON is an incredible adventure and both the 1937 Frank Capra film and this 1973 musical are faithful adaptations of the James Hilton novel What I like about the 1973 version is the freedom in which the musical numbers are presented The film has a prestigious cast and a gifted director and cinematographer This is a BURT BACHARACH ShangriLa and its a wonderful place Songs like THE WORLD IS A CIRCLE SHARE THE JOY and LIVING TOGETHER GROWING TOGETHER evoke a happiness that Hilton wrote about in his novel Why shouldnt ShangriLa be a slightly goofy place The two love songs I MIGHT FRIGHTEN HER AWAY and the deleted I COME TO YOU are the sensitive spots in the picture Theres a peacefulness and soft spoken quality in both these songs that is very much keeping with the philosophy of the story Moreover THE THINGS I WILL NOT MISS is a good duet with a strong melody Its a nice exchange of different types of perspective and who can fault with Olivia Hussey and Sally Kellerman stomping singing and dancing on tables Theyre a wonderful team and the number is well staged  I always found it interesting in this story how the High Lama kidnaps someone from the outside world to take his place in ShangriLa The character of the High Lama is a gentle soul but somewhat radical in his view of mankind as a whole He has no hope for the world outside of ShangriLa If this film were to be remade today it would be interesting to see more emphasis put on the leading character RICHARD ONWAYS conflict with what he left behind in the outside world as opposed to what hes found in ShangriLa Of course for the film to be believable the character of RICHARD CONWAY must be presented as suffering amnesia at the end like he was in the book Neither film versions of LOST HORIZON were faithful to the novel in that regard Did Conway find ShangriLa or was it imagined Did they all die in the plane crash Every man has his own idea of what his ShangriLa would be The conflict with Conway wanting to believe in ShangriLa and returning to his old life in the outside world is powerful I like the melancholy on the faces of Kellerman Kennedy and Van as they watch their friends leave the mystical valley Interesting how Conway doesnt want to leave paradise but is being pressured out by his brother Both versions of LOST HORIZON work in different ways but both are successful in probing James Hiltons ideas of a hidden valley where money has no value and moderation is the rule So in a sense its anti capitalism in its theme where as money and materialism is not the motivation Human kindness decency compassion courtesy etiquette and living harmoniously with each other is the rule  LOST HORIZON has a much stronger story than most musicals It attempts to answer the basic fundamental questions of life and one can hardly fault it for not succeeding One has to remember that LOST HORIZON in 1973 was post CABARET It was no longer fashionable for characters to break out in song in a musical much less to be dubbed by other singers LOST HORIZON was an easy target for jaded critics The expectations for it were high almost unreasonable There were two targets to be hit the producer ROSS HUNTER and BURT BACHARACH and the critics were out to get both of them Ross Hunter had enjoyed decades of financial success as a producer and LOST HORIZON was his follow up film to his 1970 blockbuster AIRPORT That film was Universals biggest moneymaker up to that time and the success of that picture triggered a decade of disaster films For years AIRPORT was the most watched film ever to be shown on television It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture At the time Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the most successful songwriters in the country The unabashed sentimentality of LOST HORIZON hardly had a chance in the wake of the breakdown of censorship in films like EASY RIDER MIDNIGHT COWBOY and THE GODFATHER Sex and violence was a new frontier in the late 60s and early 70s Audiences were flocking to films with content that they were not use to seeing on the screen Lavish musicals were no longer well received no matter how well they were made Today LOST HORIZON can be enjoyed and appreciated on several levels Its the ultimate escapist film with a strong story wonderful music an expensive budget and some quirky humor Its unconventional in the sense that the music is not introduced until 45 minutes into the film It changes course mid way when the mystical valley is introduced and why not LOST HORIZON 73 is a heavenly film that deserves rediscovering A lost and legendary treasure deserving far better than its reputation
1,I dont know what it is about the crew from CKY but everything they produce seems to be genius in its simplicity and stupidity Haggard is so incredibly dumb and funny that its almost comedic excellence Sometimes it makes absolutely no sense but who cares It made me laugh my ass off A musthave for the CKYJackass aficionado
1,I think that this short TV series was absolutely wonderful and gave both a indepth and clear explanation of everything that was on the screen at the given time This was by far David Attenborough at his best I personally thought this was one of the best documentaries in the past decade This is definitely worth peoples money I also found the bit about the abyss and deep water the most fascinating and interesting part It was incredible to find out that the Blue planet team discovered more than 10 new species of underwater life  In this documentary Attemborough almost certainly lived up to his high reputation  This was a masterpiece and will always be considered to be one of the best modern documentaries  Many congratulations to the Blue planet team
1,Hollywood movies since the 1930s have treated gays as lepers In condemning homosexuality the film industry has reflected only what the repressive society of its day espoused as an ideology For example in the 1962 Otto Preminger melodrama Advise and Consent straight actor Don Murray was cast as a queer congressman who commits suicide rather than confess his alternative lifestyle Gay movie characters have covered a lot of ground since Advise and Consent In the 1997 movie In  Out 12 out of  heterosexual actor Kevin Kline is cast as a homosexual teacher who comes out of the closet on his wedding day While the conservative Hollywood of yesteryear stipulated that the congressional queer in Advise and Consent had to commit suicide the liberal Hollywood of today dictates that the gay English teacher should be embraced rather than maced Basically In  Out preaches good citizenship in the garb of a politically correct comedy Director Frank Oz and scenarist Scott Rudnick endorse honesty as the best policy because honesty always ensures happiness High school teacher Howard Brackett Kevin Kline of The Big Chill will be happy only after he comes out of the closet just as his oncefatbutnowthin fiancée Emily Joan Cusack will only feel happy when she can ditch her diet Ultimately the movie contends that straight society will accept gays when homosexuals can act with greater honesty and candor about themselves The happily outed gay tabloid reporter played by straight actor Tom Selleck here effectively dramatizes this openminded commentary Rudnicks lightweight script embellishes the true life incident that occurred at the Oscars when Tom Hanks paid tribute to a high school teacher In In  Out Cameron Drake Matt Dillon a blond Brad Pitt style bimbo type actor wins the Oscar for impersonating a fruity foot soldier Drake honors his mentor Howard Brackett during his acceptance speech Not contend to stop there the candid Cameron reveals to a live television audience that Howard is gay Suspicion paranoia and horror set in as the media descend upon the sleepy town of Green Leaf Indiana When would a noname high school English teachers sexual deviance spark such massive media concern Among those reporters lurks Peter Malloy Tom Selleck of High Road to China and he wants to do a weeklong exclusive one on Howard Howard however wants nothing to do with the witchhunting media especially the pesky Peter Malloy Howard denies Drakes gay charges to everybody including his fiancée and his mom Malloy lingers because he smells a scoop The revelation has turned Green Leaf upside down High school principal Tom Halliwell Bob Newhart squirms nervously with all the media coverage Halliwell warns Howard that were his marriage not imminent hed have to give him a pink slip Meanwhile Peter bets Howard that his marriage to Emily will fall through at the last moment and hell be there to record the result on camera Howard resorts to audio tapes about macho men He struggles to reform himself But Howards efforts are futile Guilt swells up inside him And then there is Peter Malloy who rags him to come clean about his homosexuality Finally at the altar in the sight of God Howard bursts Of course bridetobe Emily Montgomery is floored by Howards gay confession Predictably the school fires Howard but he shows up for graduation Drake shows up too and rushes to Bracketts defense Not only has the school stripped Howard of his job but theyve also given his teacheroftheyear award to somebody else Drake appeals to the principal and wins Howard the unanimous support of the community The biggest defect in Rudnicks contrived script is Howard himself Rudnick has created a character too chaste to be true either by gray or straight standards Howard Brackett looms as more of a saint than a sinner He helps one student gain admission to college and he coaches the track team How often do you hear of an English teacher doubling as a coach too Everybody at his high school adores Howard He doesnt have a mean bone in his body Further Rudnick and Oz ask us to believe that nobody else in Green Leaf is gay Where are Howards gay friends Are they too scared to come to his defense No In  Out is not targeted strictly at homosexual audiences Oz whose screen credits include cute comedies like Dirty Rotten Scoundrels and House Sitter as well as Rudnick teeter on a politically correct tightrope In  Out is not a gay recruiting movie The filmmakers show no interest in what prompted either Howard or Peter Malloy to prefer the gay lifestyle Instead Oz and Rudnick are only interested in shoring up a thin premise Is he or isnt he gay They flesh it out to involve the community response to the answer Finally when Howard admits that he is gay the filmmakers devote the rest of the movies to showing how a conservative Norman Rockwelllike town can accept him despite his difference The most shocking scenes in In  Out is probably when tabloid reporter Malloy does a lip lock on Howard Straight guys kissing each other in a movie about a gay identity crisis are as hilarious as they are phony Kline and Selleck grind their faces together in what appears as more of a headon collision than a closedmouth kiss Nothing at all like the controversial 1994 British movie Priest In  Out emerges as an engaging but labored piece of social propaganda with its okaytobeact message If Ellen werent the TV equivalent In  Out would probably be heading toward TV as a new sitcom Watching In  Out is not so much about dealing with the issue of gay or straight but how to be a decent person in the last days of the 20th century What makes In  Out a tolerable comedy about sexual intolerance is its equal opportunity cheers and jeers about queers and steers
1,Going into this movie I was a bit cautious I have always been a bit iffy about claymation movies Ive always enjoyed decent animated movies but claymation was always different to me But this one caught me by surprise Wallace And Gromit are extremely lovable characters and its a great story with jokes for all ages Theres the silly burpfart jokes for the kids and the subtle but over the head of young kids jokes for us older people Very neat claymation and while the story had holes it kept my interest beginning to end Its so rare to find pure and uncorrupted humor these days this movie was all the more refreshing Wallace and Gromit go doing their normal thing which is exterminating HUMANELY the buggers that ruin peoples vegetable crops But this time they find themselves fighting some form of a freak huge rabbit that their humanely built traps cant even keep under tabs Great laughs and a great hour and a half of fun If you have not exposed yourself to Wallace And Gromit I highly recommend this movie The only reason I rate it a 7 and not higher is because its still a family movie and I dont have kids I enjoyed it but if I had been watching it with some little rug rats and my wife itd be at least a 9 for sure Give it a shot
1,The Hookers was to me a great everyday people story Like someone you might have known Just trying to make it my big shot is right around the corner Then Lifes little temptations creep in the spoiler stumbled again How much can your love take and give to the guy whos really not so bad after all just Human I liked it I was also a paid extra in the movie Played the drums in the bar shots with the band did several walking shots my green 66 corvette was in the motel party shots Wonderful cast and crew first rate people down to earth movie I had lunch with James Coburn on Mothers Day what a wonderful man just like Ive known him for years Ill never forget him My father spent the day with Slim Pickens and swapped horse stories Slim also was really down to earth love those guys we really miss them Real people making movies about real people Thanks Levy Gardner and Laven
1,I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool I never got the chance to see it though When I went to Blockbuster to rent some videos I figured I should watch it After all I did love Silence of the Lambs and Se7en and if you enjoyed those movies you might get a kick out of The Cell The whole story concept is very interesting Going physically into the mind of a killer I cant imagine the world they live in The acting is actually pretty decent Jennifer Lopez is the only one I have to say that wasnt that great but she does a believable job I would recommend for a scary thriller 710
1,I like many others saw this as a child and I loved it and it horrified me up until adulthood I have been trying to find this movie and even been searching for it to play again on TV someday since it originally played on USA networks Does Anyone know where to buy this movie or does anyone have it and would be willing to make a copy for me Also does anyone know if there is a chance for it to be played on TV again Maybe all of us fans should write a station in hopes of them airing it again I dont think they did a good job of promoting this movie in the past because no one really knows about people only know of the Stepford wives and Stepford husband movies No one is familiar with the fact that there was a children version Maybe they should also do a remake of it since they seem to be doing that a lot lately with a lot of my favorite old thrillerhorror flicks Well if anyone has any input Please I Beg Of You write me with information Thanks Taira tcampo23aolcom
1,The joy and tragedy of the Christmas Season lies in the fact that it mostly revolves around family That is why some people call it the childrens holiday As we age natural attrition and progress removes the people and the things that gave us our special memories John Denver in one of his sweetest roles plays George Billings a successful NYC architect and new widower who lost his wife about a year earlier His life is focused around his 9 year old daughter Alex both are still grieving their loss George is trying his best to make this a special Christmas for his daughter Enter his boss Thomas Renfield roguishly played by the wonderful Col Flagg of MASH guy Edward Winters who sends George to Georgetown CO to explore a possible real estate deal Lying to his daughter that the purpose of the trip is a vacation rather than work George and Alex fly into town where theyre immediately met by a collection of loving generous but somewhat eccentric group of characters whose main eccentricity is that they all believe in Santa Claus Georgetown is a picture book community wed all love to live in and wed love the people for neighbors George soon meets a love interest in Susan Jane Kazmarek Were it not for the grinch Renfield it would be an ideal time But the fact is he is in town to find property for Renfield to develop and there is a nice ranch near town about to be foreclosed and the dark edges of the movie revolve around the impending foreclosure and the reactions of the townies the rancher and the outsiders I wont spoil the ending for those whove never seen the movie Its a typical happy Christmas ending but its handled in a fairly subtle and believable way that shows the best in the human spirit without being too syrupy All in all this is a most pleasant way to spend a couple of your Christmas TV hours John Denver and Jane Kazmarek have nice chemistry and Gennie James as Alex does a real nice job Ive always loved the work of Mary Wickes a recognizable character actress and all of the other cast members do a nice job with less meaty parts This is a regular Christmas fare for my family I rate it 45
1,1st watched 8311996  DirTim Robbins Very thought provoking and very well done movie on the subject of the death penalty Deserved more recognition and publicity than it received
1,The Man with the Golden Arm was one of the first films to have as its main topic and in some respects the message the tragedy of heroin addiction Its nowhere near a great film but its importance lies in Otto Premingers dedication to making it feel real and on the edge of melodrama and naturalism What I liked is that its not so much an expose of junkies if you want the best expose of that read Naked Lunch if you can get through it anyway besides the point but the nature of the urban environment Frankie Machine lives He expects after he gets out of prison for dealing to go on the straight and narrow to become a drummer in a band and make it legit as a musician But he has his crippled wife Zosch who cant work and needs money and often complains and then theres the old neighborhood he cant escape seeing Louie Darren McGavin who is still doing backroom card games and yes pushing dope Like Mean Streets its hard to escape the minutia unless you leave But then again its hard for Frankie Machine not to try and operate naturally in this urban quarter Its just that he cant escape the temptation of junk when hes booked on a phony theft charge with his friend he sees a junkie freaking out and it puts back the fear of going back on into his clean self And personifying Frankie is Sinatra and I cant see anyone else who couldve played him even original choice Brando He fits into the neighborhood and seems like the kind of guy who should be a step ahead of the game But theres also a vulnerability to Sinatra that he pulls out wonderfully and by the time we see him going cold turkey in Mollys apartment its believable even if its not the kind of thing those from my generation would think of heroin ie Trainspotting and certainly Requiem for a Dream If for nothing else you want to watch the movie to see what happens to Sinatra as this character The flaws however come in some of the other performances though its a little tricky Eleanor Parker seems to be overacting for a good portion of the movie fooling Frankie that shes really crippled when in reality she can walk and is fooling him for one reason or another But then it becomes clearer as it goes along shes supposed to be nuts and nuts with jealousy and on that level it starts to get better Meanwhile Kim Novak is good though not Vertigoworthy as the possible girl in the side but more like the voice of reason in the story Then theres a Detective Bendar who might be one of the most onenote charactersperformances ever And also Sparrow Frankies nerdy friend and the characters of Louie and Schiefka and theyre all played as one might expect them to actually McGavin is better than OK As far as casting other talent around Sinatra Preminger doesnt do all that great And frankly some scenes kind of fall flat But theres a lot of fascination in the Man with the Golden Arm and not just as some dated piece of sociological interest It works as compelling drama and as a message piece conveyed without being preachy or campy Its a genuine article just not exceptional
1,Although at times I was the only one in the cinema who was laughing this is the main pleasure I took from the beautifully shot Thirst  laughter Although sometimes it seemed that the movie had an identity crisis and didnt know whether it was a tragedy or a comedy the blackest of black humour shone through at regular intervals  It helped of course that it the standard of acting by everyone concerned was wonderful and that I was slightly obsessed by the at times wicked leading lady who was gorgeously elegant no matter how blood soaked and malevolent she became I read reviews that suggested this movie was overlong I didnt think so In fact the last scenes moving and hilarious I mean the brown shoes by turns were among the best in the film
1,Nicely done evil little comedy pitting the FBI against organized crime with a nice lady caught in the middle The actress who played the jealous wife of the mob boss Tony the Tiger almost stole the show with her raging tantrums 3 stars
1,This movie is a geman undiscovered Gerry Anderson classic The origins of both UFO and Space 1999 are obvious from this movie including the cast list which includes the late Ed Bishop and George Sewell who both went onto UFO It is unfortunate that Anderson despite his many TV successes did not get a chance to develop his talent on the big screen Just think what he could have done with the movie version of Thunderbirds which he quite rightly disowned himself from Im sure if you give JTTFSOTSDoppleganger a fair chance youll appreciate its good qualities
1,There is a lot wrong with this film I will not lie I will say that most of the problems feel like they stem from a budget that was chopped out from underneath the flick and some bad hack job editing This is not Office Space Do not go in expecting Office Space levels of comedy It is very funny though It is a mess but very funny at the same time A funny mess of a film In the way that Caddyshack is funny A mess of unrelated funny scenes filled with some very annoying unfunny scenes It works as a whole though and it certainly deserves a wide release This is the best commentary on the Wal Mart Starbucks MTV nation you could hope for The very fact that a film is exploring the idea that dumb people are breeding at an alarming rate while the intelligent people are not is great in my book Not very politically correct but worth at least some debate
1,Deep Blood Its one of those movies you here about and you say not another Italian Jaws ripoff Well Deep Blood is far from that It is a cheap as film making can get and on the other side it is creative as well In Jaws and all the other shark films we all have seen or herd about they all use fake made sharks well in Joe DAmatos film he takes a new approach by using all stock footage for his shark scenes This is one of the many reasons I like Deep Blood so much is because it didnt use stock footage In Deep Blood an ancient Indian spirit terrorizes a beach town in the form of a bloodthirsty shark in Joe DAmatos Shark classic Deep Blood It seems that a Native American elder once warned a group of youngsters about this great evil in the sea and years later the friends are forced to face their fears when one of them is killed by a shark in a series of attacks along their coastline Now its up to the remaining few to make sure that this monster is killed even if it means heading out to sea to do it Joe DAmato Directed and Produced this film under his company the Filmirage Released in 1989 and was later used in Bruno Matteis Cruel Jaws Jaws 5 along with many other shark films Joe DAmatos shark entry is a great film and any Joe DAmato fan of shark movie watcher should give it a try
1,Being the second last of Chaplins Essanay films CARMEN is a parody of Cecil B Demilles drama with the same title It stands as quite obvious that Demilles acknowledged film didnt impress the comedy king that much which he later admitted in his autobiography Parodies were not a new experiment for Chaplin He had done several of them already namely HIS PREHISTORIC PAST and HIS NEW JOB and would continue to do so until the very end of his career in films for instance in A KING IN NEW YORK Chaplin does a very good portrayal of Don José and Edna Purviances is very as good as Carmen Neither act as we are used to Charlie is not the lovable Tramp and Edna is far from an innocent little woman but that was not Chaplins intentions either A BURLESQUE ON CARMEN is a somewhat odd Chaplinfilm very different but includes good material nonetheless The main story is although very differently structured as in the original drama Don José is very much in love with Carmen but is not alone in that field Carmen Carmen the beautiful Carmen is loved by all men under 96 but he has the big advantage that he is an officer and there we are this is the famous story about rivalry love greed and honor seen from a humorous perspective Thanks to Chaplins and Purviances performances and to the wonderful wonderful music by George Bizet which I highly admire this could actually have been a nearcomedy masterpiece its time taken into consideration It could have been But unfortunately although it is a good pretty good comedy I dont feel its fair to blame people who claim that A BURLESQUE OF CARMEN is far from being a masterpiece But its important to keep in mind that this has nothing to do with any lack of talent but rather a result of conflicts concerning business When Chaplin refused to resign Essanay contract after completing his last film for the company POLICE they took revenge by editing back all the scenes Chaplin originally had edited out from CARMEN Thanks to this the film is somewhat confusing and has several pointless scenes which are more annoying than funny and the film turned out to be rather a Ben Turpinfeature Turpin played Remendados than a Chaplinshort Naturally Chaplin was in despair when he discovered what Essanay had done and had to stay in bed for several days Despite its obvious flaws A BURLESQUE OF CARMEN is highly recommended to Chaplinfans and to admirers of beautiful music
1,Beautifully filmed acclaimed director Hugh Hudson Chariots of Fire creates a story that brings the entire legend of John Clayton Lord Greystoke and Tarzan of the apes to life with reverence and dignity and with a scope not heretofore seen in Tarzan films Christopher Lambert makes his starring debut as the young Lord raised in the wild by a female gorilla after his parents die in Africa Later returned to what is to him an alien world that of class and privilege he feels totally out of place Once he learns what has happened to the apes that raised him and their world he realizes that he must go back A sad but triumphant story told against a background of fantastic vistas This is one of those films that is a must for every Cinemaphiles collection
1,LIGHTS OF NEW YORK was the first alltaking feature film coming in at a brisk 57 minutes and directed by Bryan Foy of the famous vaudeville family The story has two dopey barbers Cullen Landis Eugene Palette yearning for a chance at big city life and getting involved with gangsters and bootleg booze One of the guys gets framed for the murder of a cop but is saved at the last minute by a gun moll Gladys Brockwell Much of the story takes place in a night club called The Night Hawk which is run by a crook named Hawk Wheeler Oakman who has his eye on a pretty chorine Helene Costello who is the girl friend of Landis Costello gets to do a brief dance and we hear Harry Downing made up to resemble Ted Lewis sing At Dawning in his best Al Jolson style The acting ranges from good Palette and Brockwell to awful Oakman A couple of the actors muff their lines but then keep right on with the scene As noted elsewhere this was intended to be a short 2reeler and was made on a shoestring budget Yet the sound quality is surprisingly good the voices all register clearly and there is a neat cinematic touch in the silhouette death The film was a boxoffice smash even though it was shown as a silent film where theaters were not wired for the new sound technology No one expected this little film to gross an amazing 13 million It briefly made stars of Costello and Landis and certainly launched Palette on his long career as a star character actor Costars include Mary Carr as the mother Robert Elliott as the detective Eddie Kane as the street cop and Tom Dugan as a thug
1,I thought this was a really cute movie  inspiring makes me want to try acting I LOVE Kelly Ripa and its nice that I can watch this in addition to All My Children  Ive already watched it 3 times Of course I also loved seeing Joe Barbara  especially since Another World went off the air
1,My husband and I watched this last nightIt was wonderfulFor once he was wrong in guessing ahead of time the suspenseful ending It moved along very quickly and the acting was superb I adore Tom Wilkinson anyway He has never made a bad movie as far as Im concerned The above description of his acting hits the nail on the head The facial expressions are incredible Even the picturesque scenery is awesome We have just finished watched all of the Prime Suspect series and I am convinced that the British have a way of capturing the audience There is no doubt that I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to get a few hours of thorough entertainment
1,Reallife husband and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly star in Creation which recounts the period of Charles Darwins life prior to the publication of On the Origin of Species in 1859 his infamous world changing tome on evolution and natural selection Darwins research created an enormous rift a schism between the believers of his day and scientists He was said at the time to be going to war against God and even to have killed God The film revolves around Darwins life with his wife and four children Jennifer Connelly is excellent as his extremely devout and loving wife A revealing scene at the beginning when she leads the dinner table in prayer and Charles fails to say Amen is foreshadowing of what will follow and of the stark differences between the two She is convinced that he will be eternally damned and bring misfortune to their family by rejecting God Darwin is torn between his strong love for his wife her faith and his even stronger reason There are beautiful moments of him observing animals dissecting their behaviors and the sequences that make up their lives explaining phenomenons of selection to his children the first born Annie having a very morbid curiosity We see him interacting with Englands first orangutan Jenny playing with it as if it were a child deciphering her every look and action  Annie the eldest child later dies and Charles becomes haunted by her death having been closest to her In my opinion this part was too long bizarre and drawn out I did not like the trippy scenes where he seems to be losing his mind and is pursued by the ghost of his daughter shouting and ranting Although Charles thinks that his wife blames him for her fatal sickness she very poetically says The truth is if I knew then what I know now I would marry you tomorrow Their bond is solid and unbreakable despite tremendous differences of belief  When Charles finishes his manuscript he hands his wife the final copy telling her she can burn it if she does not agree She stays up reading it nights on end and finally presents him with a package the book ready to be sent to its publisher In the end reason and perhaps love as well triumph as he makes an accomplice out of his staunchest adversary It is fascinating that Darwin received a full Christian burial at Westminster Abbey proof that his groundbreaking ideas were seen as controversial of course but were already then recognized as vital knowledge for the advancement of the human race  The movie definitely draws heavily on Darwins family life its joys and its troubles I happened to like this aspect but Fabio said it was like watching a documentary on I quote Hitlers passion for pingpong This is true in some respects and I cant disagree with his desire to have learned more about Charles Darwins theories from this film than we do It remains nevertheless a well executed and flawlessy acted period drama  My rating 7 Fabios 7 Total score 14
1,Somewhere in the dark recesses of my brain cells a song plays in my head I cant forget it no matter how hard I try Its MIDNIGHT MADNESS and its gonna get to you Wish i could find a copy of this on a 45rpm record Five disparate teams head out one night in LA for a scavenger hunt for clues instead of physical objects An unkempt gamemaster with two gorgeous assistants is the mastermind of all this insanity thats about to be unleashed on LA All the teams are stereotypes this movie being from 1980 before political correctness screwed everything up the good guys the nerds led by Eddie Deezen the dumb beerloving jocks the wedontneedamantype ladies especially the redhead The giggling twins are a scream too And finally the bad guys with Stephen Furst as the leader Furst is hilarious as the overweight slob Harold whose attempt to use a computer to decipher the various clues leads to a gooey mess Movies like this arent made anymore These days movies have to have an edginess to them with some dark characters and other nonsense Go back to the days when the good guys led by David Naughton were still good and not hopelessly conflicted So dump all serious pretensions and go back to 1980 Its MIDNIGHT MADNESS   
1,I watched a made for television film about the destruction at Waco Texas It was obviously heavily slanted toward the claim that David Koresh was a murderous child raping cult leader hellbent on killing as many cops as he wanted and taking his people to the heavens on a blood stained stairway The film was little more than propaganda further detailing what we had already read in the newspapers I am more and more sure of that since I watched the great documentary Waco The Rules of Engagment Not that every assertion made in this film should be taken as Gods truth but it tells the whole story rather than regurgitating only what law enforcement decided to tell For those who have forgot Koresh was the spiritual leader of the religious movement named The Branch Davidians Charges of drug use kidnapping illegal weapon ownership and statutory rape among others Im sure raised the suspicions of the local police then later federal law enforcement While attempting to serve a search warrant the ATF Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms and the clan participated in a shoot out that left deceased and wounded on both sides It was then that the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI got involved Communications between the two were spirited but eventually broke down The FBI prepared for an invasion by assaulting the building with flashbang grenades and gas When the building burnt to the ground killing many within including Koresh the FBI refused to admit responsibility saying the cult inside must have set it on fire themselves This hearkened images of Jim Jones and other violent religious organizations The picture puts on many masks to tell its story It begins with a sampling of the congressional hearings perhaps the truth as far as the record is concerned anyway What is eyeopening is how partisan the politicians remained even in a difficult and serious situation as this The Democrats were concerned in nothing more than defending every single action taken by law enforcement It was the Republicans that seemed open to the other side It is impossible to relate all of the new information and analysis provided by this documentary Additionally a list would take away from the film opening up as it goes along One example would be the heartbreaking fact that children died within the compound The filmmakers probably side more with the Davidians in general but stay relatively open to either side In this instance the feds seem at fault for mishandling a situation that involves innocent children But on the other hand the parents also need to shoulder some of the blame for leaving their kids in this harmful situation when they could have released them to any number of local authorities Probably the most damning new information comes late in the film and involves the FBIs claim they did not fire upon the building This is left up to interpretation and I will not reveal any more than to say it is disturbing and shocking what can and cannot be told The federal officers are not held in a critical or corrupt light any more than Koresh The largest condemnation seems to be leveled on the media unwilling to tell both sides of a story This element seems prevalent in recent documentaries duly so I believe It is time for the media to return to telling news stories and leave this relentless pursuit of what will draw the biggest audience and ratings It is hard to mess up a documentary In most cases switching on a camera and editing together interesting pieces of life is common and tells a terrific story What few can do is shed such new light on a subject that the way you think about it is forever altered Waco is that kind of film 5 out of 
1,Burt Reynolds directed this action movie and surprise he is actually a pretty good director This movie starts off well as Burts attempted bust of a drug dealer is botched and he is demoted down to the vice squad The ensemble cast has some pretty funny scenes as Brian Kieth is always eating something Bernie Casey has more class than all of his coworkers combined and Charles Durning loses control of his squad The vice cops stumble on a highpriced callgirl ring that may have something to do with a series of murders Sharkey spends days staking out Dominoes Rachel Ward apartment and starts to really adore her from afar Just when they are getting close to the crime leader Dominoe is murdered I wont give away any of the surprises in the plot but the first hour of this film is great Unfortunately the screenplay gets very clichéd and unbelievable after that Why would Burt Reynolds confront the crime boss with his big secret Sure it makes the guy sweat but it causes many more cops to be killed And it is not believable that Dominoe and Sharkey would make love after they have know each other for one day much less while their lives are in danger And at the end what happened to all the police that run into the building with our heroes Isnt there a SWAT team Also the film never actually tells you how all of the bad guys are connected and why they have to kill so many people There is a very effective torture scene on a boat near the end of the film which is probably the only really nailbiting scene of the film It is a shame that the climax is a typical shootemup Still this film is certainly entertaining if you like crime and action movies Dont think about the plot holes and you will have a good time
1,Summer of My German Soldier was one of the many TV movies that became a staple of the small screen in the 1970s others were Brians Song Sybil and Someones Watching Me It portrays a Jewish girl Kristy McNichol befriending a German POW Bruce Davison in WWIIera Georgia One of the things that the movie shows is that many of the German soldiers werent really Nazis but were just drafted Watching the movie I got a real sense of how things must have been in the South back then I mean can you imagine being a Jewish person accused of supporting the enemy  So I certainly recommend this movie I believe that its always important to show the things portrayed here Occasional overacting keeps the movie from being a fullscale masterpiece but they usually do quite well I hope that the movie eventually comes out on DVD Also starring Esther Rolle and Michael Constantine the My Big Fat Greek Wedding patriarch
1,This particular film was one that I wanted to see in theaters but never got around to it When I finally rented it in the summer of 2001 I enjoyed it so much that I went out and bought the DVD soon after Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake did a wonderful job with the screenplay and are wonderful to listen to on the audio commentary that is included on the DVD They did a great job in creating characters that you really care about I really felt a whirlwind of emotions watching this film including sadness anxiety and joy The film also does a great job in showing the importance of family a rarity in film today which is a reflection of the director Bonnie Hunt based on the comments she made on the DVD David Duchovny showed me here that there is life beyond Fox Mulder giving a wonderful performance with some pretty poignant scenes I highly recommend that you give this movie a viewing I am really thankful to the creators of this film They have given me a wonderful piece of cinematic viewing that I will recommend to all my friends I have seen a lot of movies over the years and it is very rare that I come away with such a feeling of satisfaction after watching a film I will watch this time and time again for years to come Return to Me reminds me that there are still moviemakers out there that know how to sincerely please their movie audiences Thanks
1,Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been in I love watching him i was 10 yrs old 1979 when i seen him for the first timei eagerly await each and everything hell be acting in hopefully one day i can see him in person hes very hypnotic and mysterious and that voice is commanding and strong he is very attractive even now at 65 he is absolutely stunning In my opinion he is the greatest actor ive ever seen i adored him in Dracula  along with a lot of other girls out there and in god created womanhouse of DJason and the argonauts and many more i thought he was genius cant wait to see him in good night and good luck

1,This is a clever story about relationships and a display of three main categories of players in the game of relationships playboys Max manipulative women Alice and the fools who may be indeed in love Lisa Muriel and Lucien Max and Alice are very unlikeable and perhaps despicable characters but who are always in control in the game leaving their partners around in the dark But as the profusely discussed ending tells us as veteran players as Max and Alice were they would be happy to part ways anytime they see fit as if the game was just announced to be over and each one of them could not care less to get on with his or her own life and play another game with some other anonymous people when another opportunity presented itself Lisa Muriel and Lucien might be the ones who felt like investing something real in a relationship only not being able to realise that they were the baits in the game and the ultimate losers as far as what we were shown is concernedwho knows if they are also advance players of some sort in their worlds not shown to us on screen This is a very fastpaced delicately crafted and seductively witty story with an enticing execution by the cast It also deserves some deeper thinking how much is real in a game of relationship
1,Silent historical drama based on the story of Anne Boleyn newly arrived ladyinwaiting to the Queen who catches the lustful eye of Henry VIII badtempered King of England who loves to feast drink hunt be entertained by his court jester watch jousts and chase around after young beauties who jump out of cakes and assorted attractive females around the castle Well hes soon annulled his marriage married Anne and telling her it is her holy duty to produce a male heir She fails on that score and he soon has his eye on yet another ladyinwaiting Meanwhile Anne spends pretty much the entire film looking hesitant perturbed or downright ready to burst into tears She just doesnt come across as a happy camper or is it just bad acting This film is a solid piece of entertainment with an absorbing story that held my interest for two hours  plus I enjoyed seeing the very lavish medieval costuming featured here on a gorgeous sepia tinted print Emil Jannings is quite striking and memorable in his welldone portrayal of King Henry the Eighth  he really seemed like he WAS Henry the Eighth I am not so sure about the performance given by the actress who plays Anne seemed a bit over the top The DVD of this film features an appropriate nicely done piano score that perfectly suits this story Quite a good film
1,Mr Bean starring the legendary Rowan Atkinson was a huge hit during its run in the 1990s and I probably first saw it when I was around ten shortly after it ended so I was seeing reruns I certainly wasnt much of a fan at the time and didnt see too many episodes I didnt really get into the show until my late teens just a few years ago which was when I finally watched every episode Unlike before it made me laugh many times and since then that has always been the case during repeat viewings of episodes  Mr Bean is a mysterious selfcentred antisocial extremely naive buffoon whose best friend is his Teddy He is pretty much isolated from society and life is not easy for him as he constantly struggles with very simple things This is because he lacks some fairly basic knowledge and has the mind of a child He finds himself in various kinds of trouble wherever he goes and comes up with very bizarre ways to try and solve the problems he faces Not only does he often cause trouble for himself but sometimes for other people as well which he often doesnt tend to realize In other words Mr Bean is a walking disaster  The humour in this show is very visual and there is very little dialogue The gags are almost always sight gags which is mostly what the show is about While there may be an occasional lacklustre gag I would say the vast majority of them are funny often hilarious there are so many highlights While Mr Bean is certainly not the most sophisticated comedy ever made its still great for many of those who like visual humour and due to the very limited dialogue you dont even have to speak fluent English to enjoy the show which is why it has received such a worldwide reputation The show ran for a few years but the episodes were made very gradually so only fourteen were made in total Nonetheless it is a classic series and deserves its wide appeal
1,There is a great danger when you watch a film that had had such a profound affect on you the first time around  that 20 years later  it wont hold the same magic as it did before I must admit i wasnt expecting it to be as good as i remembered but a was pleasently suprised Ptang Yang Kipperbang is still as fantastic as i remember it when i was a 12 year old This film has a certain type of brilliance that not many films possess It is engrossing  it is briliantly acted and best of all it makes me feel like a kid again and there isnt many things that can do that John Albasiny and Abigail Cruttendens rolls in this film are 1st class and i had forgotten how good they were until now I urge any parent of teenagers to sit them down and watch this and see if it has the same affect on them as it did on me PTANG YANG KIPPERBANG EEHHH 10 out of 10
1,An old man is riding his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere strikes him down dead and keeps driving The rest of the film is spent discovering who hit him why he was hit and what consequences this murder will have on the rest of the village Separate Lies is a very British movie indeed Im not saying that hitandrun car accidents are a particularly British phenomenon but the way everyone reacts to this tragedy is very British Tom Wilkinson plays James Manning a hardworking respectable citizen with a stiffupperlip attitude towards tragedy His wife Anne Emily Watson who is twenty years younger than her husband is more emotional more impulsive and more prone to drama The man who really spices up life in this sleepy village is playboy millionaire William Bule played by a deliciously devilish Rupert Everett most American audiences will eternally remember him as Julia Roberts gay friend who completely stole every scene in My Best Friends Wedding In Separate Lies Everett is cruel cold and selfish but hes an absolute blast on screen No its not that exciting of a movie title Separate Lies  how did they end up with that lame and forgettable title Did they just not have a marketing team Did they just now care about getting people to see this film but beyond the title is a heartbreaking drama about the power of forgiveness
1,OhMyGAWD THE MAGIC GARDEN is perhaps one of my most vivid 70s childhood memories Two hippie chicks with ponytails Carole and Paula would swing on swings tell jokes they picked off the chuckle patch dress up with costumes they found in a giant chest called The Storybox and argue with a pesky pink squirrel named Sherlock that lived in one of their trees They also could strum a mean acoustic guitar and sing a pretty melody This was a great childhood show Very 70s feeling But thats the problem They dont MAKE shows like this anymore Pity that You could tell these two girls really had hearts of gold and loved kids they were really sweet MAGIC GARDEN is one of those shows that if they came out with a box set people WOULD buy it because its such a MELLOW walk down Memory Lane
1,If you are looking for a film that is quick witted and wont bore you then this is the place It is fast paced and funny with some decent acting comeing from the characters It is always hard for me to see Mark Walhberg as anything except Marky Mark That image is burned in my mind forever As an actor though he is pretty good This movie is a must see for action fans who like to see a few little twists and turns I will have to pick this movie up one day and buy it
1,I have seen this film more then once Actually El Padrino was one of the best feature films that I have seen in a great deal of time There was a big cast Jennifer Tilly Faye Duanway Brad Dourif and Damian Chapa who really shined like a real star in this part of Kilo I heard this film was shot for under two million dollars I have seen films shot for 33 million that cant compare to the quality and production value Damian Chapa why are you not getting offers and more film work EXCELLENT JOB I cant wait to see the sequel and I hope it has the same action Jennifer Tilly has made a cult classic character with Sabeva Damian Chapa moves coolly in every scene much like the movie stars of the 40s and 50s So sick of seeing these non charismatic actors like Ben Stiller getting all of these films when there is talent like this that have something to show a great film GO GO GO KICK SOME BUT IN SALES EL PADRINO
1,It pays to watch Readers Digest Or Time if it was the original source of the article that served as a supposed inspiration to Mani Ratnam to make this masterpiece Based on a true story of an adopted girl who goes in search of her biological parents Mr Ratnam paints a classic that rivets as much as it rebukes cherishes as much as it chastens and preaches as much as it practises Where does one start The foreboding gloom that precedes fresh strife in northern Sri Lanka The chaotic household of a family headed by a firebrand engineerauthor and 3 adorably naughty children Or that murky region where reality crosses the point of providing a comfortable existence and becomes a monster of incredulous and sinister events and ideologies Whichever way one looks at it this film is worth being in your collection if you happen to like Mani Ratnams compelling dramas Mr Ratnam is a past master in blending fictional tales within real life incidents and in this film he oozes class in adapting two reallife stories into one I will not go into the story as it is better seen than read But what I will dwell upon is the impact it had upon me and why for all the warmongering that happens in this world it cannot destroy that simple yet inexhaustible force called hope Innocence in its purity cannot fathom the complex desires of adult decadence and greed Nor does it recognize perils when it is accompanied by the fierce determination to seek what it wants It is an innocence of such nature that drives Amudha to seek her biological parents despite warnings that they could be lost in the cauldron of civil war Having survived a terrorizing experience of conversing with a physically challenged man only to realize that he is a more lethal entity in disguise Amudha sticks to her cause in a manner that tears down her wellwishers resistance And finally when the twain do meet mother and daughter the reunion is so taut with emotion that even the temperamental adoptive father is reduced to tears Aided by a coruscating background score from A R Rahman the scene that follows is poignant to melt even the stoniest of hearts a list of questions that Amudha has to ask her biological mother In a culmination as dramatic as the sequence of incidents leading to it a child discovers its mother alive in body but lost in spirit With the crushing realization that she has no hope of staying with the one who bore her Amudha does to her adoptive mother what this films title means a peck on the cheek As for the cast the trail is clearly blazed by the brilliant PS Keerthana Mr Ratnam has a gift of extracting spectacular performances from littleknown child artistes but this should take nothing away from Keerthana for an awardwinning performance With an able supporting cast of Madhavan Thiru Simran Indira and the stupendous Nandita Das Shyama she embellishes the scenes in almost every frame she is in The music may be not as memorable as other Rahman offerings but that still didnt stop him from garnering another National Award for the best music direction Vellai Pookal is as much an ode for the need to cherish human life as it is for nature The dialogues are topclass sample the touching exchange Amudha and Indira have on the swing shortly after the revelation that she is not Indiras biological daughter and the cinematography superb This film is a clear statement to drop arms as much as it is to respect human life and expressions Do not judge it as a lesson in filmmaking you will only lose out on experiencing one of the very best from the Mani RatnamA R Rahman stable
1,Another Asian horror movie packed with intense and creepy moments Another Asian horror trademark is the complexity of the plot which is here as well MAJOR SPOILER WARNING The movie starts pretty simple  two sisters go to live with their dad and stepmother after being put in a mental institution after their mother hanged herself The sisters seem very hostile towards their mother  especially the elder one  and they seem to ignore their father All goes smoothly until the mother locks the young sister in the wardrobe and the elder sister tells her father Then it hits you your sister has been dead for years now It turns out the older sister is still not recovered from the death of her mother and what we didnt know is that the wardrobe the mother was hanged in fell on the younger sister and killed her as wellAs for the stepmother she is the alter ego of the older sister  revealed when the stepmother actually the sisters alter ego is sitting on a couch when the real stepmother walks in I hope it has been made clearer for confused Asian horror fans out there Finally  my favourite scene is the scene where the father invites friends over for dinner and one of the friends starts to choke which erupts into a panic attack Very creepy 7 out of 10
1,With boundless raw energy and an uncompromising vision Talk Radio brilliantly explores the publics fondness for reducing strangers private problems into entertainment via the radio Eric Bogosian is sensational as Barry Champlaine a rude inyourface talk radio host Hes a natural for this kind of role and fine tunes one of the most impressive interesting radio personalities Ive ever seen on screen The timing and delivery of his insults to his various callers are strokes of genius Alec Baldwin also shines as Barrys boss He demonstrates the same explosive cynicism that he would later display 1992s Glengarry Glen Ross But the supporting role that truly stands out is the stoned seemingly braindead teen played by Michael Wincott You have to see it to believe it Oliver Stone and Robert Richardson do a great job with the photography which is almost entirely confined to a single broadcasting room The claustrophobic feel of the movie perfectly mirrors its tone After all one of the major points of the film is exploiting peoples private moments to draw an audience Stone demonstrates that these moments are often too private for the whole world to experience Talk Radio is a film with strong emotional and cerebral impact  the likes of which are seldom seen today
1,Ive watched a lot of television in my 51 years but Ive never had so much fun week after week as I had watching Oz The acting by the entire cast was excellent The writing was just perfect with every character remaining consistent throughout the six year run I also enjoyed the mayhem and the ultraviolence It may sound odd but it was at times comical finding out how one of the characters would eventually end up dead I particularly enjoyed the true romance and love between Beecher and Keller Those two men really knew how to throw down in every way possible I truly hope that HBO will continue to show us reruns of this great show FOREVER Ive watched every episode at least 4 times yet I still look forward to Tuesday and Thursday nights at 11 pm for an episode of this fun and very entertaining show
1,Like many situation comedies The War at Home is getting better with each episode The characters are starting to become real and I believe them as a family I agree with many that the first few episodes were not that funny I thought the show would be canceled for sure But with the absences of Malcolm in the Middle and Arrested Development War provides much needed live action comedy for FOX on Sunday nights And when compared with the rest of the sitcoms airing right now War is an even better choice Its appeal at least for me lies in its real situations Teenagers have sex Not every parent likes how their kids are turning out Parents fight and call each other names But rather than relying on being mean like many shows everything is nice in the end which is the number one rule of a good sitcom One detraction from the show is the narration duringin between scenes The Arrested DevelopmentFamily Guy style of flashbacks work well enough but the narration can be too much So anyone who needs something to watch on Sunday nights should check out The War at Home especially considering what is on the other major networks at that time
1,Vidor shines as Judith the only truly strong and compassionate member of a strictly patriarchal family Her brother David is so downtrodden by their father that its a surprise hes able even to tie his shoes rather than asking Dad to do it for him Other reviewers have already outlined the plot so I wont rehash it I will however point out that Nan who is pregnant by David is also married to him This is not an outofwedlock pregnancy which would have been horrific by 1921 standards The two are secretly married but Nans father having been paid by Davids father tears up their marriage certificate Nans death scene with Judith in attendance is a truly heartrending experience and highly charged with emotion This scene alone is worth watching the movie for but theres far more to the plot than that why on earth arent modern movies made with the same attention to the story
1,The 13th and last RKO Falcon film starts with the mutual injunction by Tom Conway as Tom Lawrence alias the Falcon and Ed Brophy as Goldie of No dames whilst they prepare to go on vacation While youre still wondering what theyre going on vacation from as they hadnt had a job since the beginning of the 1st film in 1941 with Sanders as Gay though and Jenkins as Goldie they bump into a woman and get dragged into a seedy industrial espionage caper They promise to help her when her uncle is murdered by taking an envelope containing the details of a formula to make substitute industrial diamonds to his business colleague in Miami Suspect everyone here except the cops here who are after Lawrence  and Goldie for the murder To console himself Goldie keeps paraphrasing travel brochures On the coldest day you can always enjoy the warmth of a nice cosy electric chair for one Some nice languid atmospheric nightclub scenes rub shoulders with some especially bad behaviour from the baddies Favourite bit the dignified game of hide and seekhunt the thimble the imperturbable and suave Lawrence has with the baddies on the sleeper train Least favourite bit the most embarrassing scene in the entire series in the alligator wrestling hut  definitely thrown in for the kids All in all not the best in the series but yet another entertaining outing with an overall satisfying plot and many episodes even in this that make me wish they could have gone on for just a few more years as Columbia did with Boston Blackie although RKO were churning these out faster Absolutely no sex not much violence in fact none at all by todays high standards and positively no message all make this type of film anathema to serious people who can only regard movies as an art form that must depend on these three pillars Three Diet Falcons were made later with John Calvert in the title role I dont mind them but could never bring myself to count them into the main series which Tom Conway had made his own by this time Sad also that it was all downhill after this for Conway who moved into TV voice overs and even played Norman Conquest in Park Plaza 605 rather well in 1953 He also developed serious eye and alcohol problems  I dont know if they were linked  wound up poverty stricken and after a spell in hospital in 1967 was found dead in his girlfriends bed For us folk that want to at least we still have his 10 entertaining Falcons plus a number of other worthy even classic RKO movies from 1942 to 1946 with which to remember him by
1,i think the title of the movie describes it well if you are looking for a documentary on louis kahn and his work youll have to look somewhere else although some of that is covered in this film of course i eat up pretty much anything im fed and i dont know much of the family history revolving around this case so i believed what i was told about nathaniel and his father etc for what this movie was i thought it was pretty good a little slow and grabbing for attention at time i wish that nathaniel would have focused a little more on his fathers work than his family drama although much of the history was interesting louis was a bit of a player this really is a journey through someones life and i was happy to tag along for the experience a learning experience for me and so it seems for the filmmaker as well  oh and the footage of some of kahns work is stunning
1,Look we rated this a 10 on entertainment value Its a comedy sure not an epic like Lord of the Rings or Gone with the Wind Still for comedy particularly these days its a 10 Not a long movie moves quickly and easily Kelsey Grammar right at home is this role as a loose but brilliant captain of a diesel sub pitted against the US Nuclear Navy in a war game designed to see if Terrorists could get a nuclear bomb through our defenses kinda ironic this plotpre 911 Dont take this topic seriously cause its mostly laughs from start to finish Rob Schneider is 2nd in command like Frank Burns and pulls many laughs All the others are perfect for their parts as well Rip Torn and Bruce Dern Look plain and simple you got 90 minutes and need a laugh or pick me up and youre not a prude their is some language and innuendo then rent it or buy it we did and enjoy I wish they would make a part 2
1,If you asked me to pick the best acted movies ever made this movie would be on a short list along with 1951s Streetcar Named Desire I imagine ill discover some others that qualify but Kramer vs Kramer is an outstanding exercise in naturalism So its a very satisfying experience on that level just watching the marvelous probing performances of Dustin Hoffman Meryl Streep and the child Justin Henry in particular One of the best child performances ever But I also find it very satisfying to watch because its such a thoroughly involving story  it always makes me forget my own problems It has such excellent narrative drive Once you stick Kramer vs Kramer on and Alice Kramer leaves Ted to juggle work and their young son telling him nothing more than she has to discover herself  you keep watching to know that everything turns out okay for them And even once you know how things do turn out each moment of the ride just rings so brilliantly true that its a joy to watch it happen again and again Make no mistake  Kramer vs Kramer is not light entertainment its a very realistic portrayal of the effects of divorce on everyone involved 1010 For one of the best scripts born out of conversations between Benton and Hoffman who was going through a divorce at the time ever written executed and performed beautifully and faultlessly Not to mention what a great involving story it is Put simply a perfect film
1,Well it took them 4 tries but they finally got it right In this 4th sequel to the Karate Kid franchise the producers really hit a home run Well first of all I applaud them for finally getting rid of Ralph Macchio I felt he never did service to the role of the Karate Kid I would have rather have seen Danny Ralph Mouth Most in that role Macchio turned out what proved to be the best movie in the series and look where his career is now Instead they put in a girl They got Hillary Swank best known for playing a variety of sheman parts in every movie she is in I personally dont care for her buck teeth but thats a personal preference But still look how Karate Kid 4 launched her career into orbit She won a freakin Oscar Jiminey Christmas Meanwhile where is Ralphy He should put out some amateur porn tape like Screech or something Anyways my only disagreement with the movie is that they have a girl doing karate As a selfproclaimed master of Karate I have been the proud owner of a white belt for the last 8 58 years The first thing they taught me is that there is no place in any of the martial arts for girls well except for Judo but thats kinda gay So for the purposes of accuracy I think they should have stuck with another male for this role I was thinking perhaps Dennis Franz He would give the role the depth it requires Perhaps they will listen to my suggestions and make the proper adjustments in Karate Kid 5 Its too Pat Marita is no longer I was thinking maybe Justin Guarini is the perfect replacement for the lovable Asian fellow Mr Miyagi He will give Wax on wax off a whole new meaning HAHAHAHAHAHA funny huh Anyways if you are looking for an exciting movie filled with Karate and triumph of the human spirit Karate Kid 4 is for you Dont waste your time with 13 This is the Karate Kid for you This is the Karate Kid for r the ages
1,Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature Bugs BunnyDaffy DuckElmer Fudd in a war of words and wits about whether its rabbit season or duck season Love Bugs and Daffy stirring up pronoun trouble with Daffy always the victim of Elmers shotgun resulting with his beak always getting dismembered Then theres the rabbits crossdressing that always gets Elmer in his love struck mode Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese are always favorites of mine in the writerdirector team category because of these hilarious hunting trilogy cartoons Ive laughed at since I was a kid And at least two of them end with Daffys exclamation to Bugs Youre despicable Cant get better that that
1,If youre a longtime fan of the Doctor and you cringed when you heard they were making another series rest easy  it more than meets the high expectations of the original The pacing is much quicker than the original shows fitting more often into 50 minutes episodes rather than the average 90 minutes The writing is excellent the acting superb The hardest  and best  thing to get used to is the production values of the new series Compared to the original its got some now Although I will always have fond memories of bubblewrap and handpuppet monsters If youre not a fan or if you tried the original and couldnt get a handle on it jump in with both feet now Everything you really need to know about the Doctor theyll tell you as they go along This series was written with minimal references to the Doctors enormous back story specifically to encourage new viewers Admittedly Im only seeing the first new series now as its being shown on the SciFi channel in other words probably cut to ribbons for time constraints but Im looking forward to future episodes either on broadcast TV or on DVD July 4th cant come soon enough
1,Although perhaps not as entertaining as some of Herzogs work Little Dieter is another fine film by one of the worlds greatest film artists Departing from Herzogs usual themes Little Dieter is a fascinating and uplifting character study about a brave man and his efforts to go on living after a lifealteringly traumatic experience  Dieter Dengler wanted to fly from a very young age and the Viet Nam war gave him that opportunity but instead of spending the war soaring in a cockpit he spent most of it grounded as a POW Dieter tells most of his story eloquently and passionately with occasional help from Herzog Herzog does very little voice over this time but contributes a lot of subtly powerful soundscaping and visuals  which should be no surprise to those familiar with him Dengler is a fascinating and extremely likable person As human and as alive as they come I found the story of his life and his incorrigibly upbeat personality to be inspiring Thanks to Herzog for reintroducing him to us The scale of the film is not as sprawling and the drama is not as fierce as many of the early films that made Herzog a force to be reckoned with Nevertheless I strongly recommend this to his fans and to those who enjoy documentaries Its a very interesting and well executed film
1,Out of the many films Ive seen Tommy Boy is a rare film where I can watch it over and over and its still funny David Spade and the late Chris Farley do their best in this film and is a mustsee by anyone whos a fan of the SpadeFarley duo
1,Another fantastic offering from the Monkey Island team and though it was a long time coming and had to survive the departure of Ron Gilbert its another worthy installment My only gripe is that it was a little short seeming in comparison to the previous two though that might be because of a glorious lack of diskswapping Roll on MI4
1,Screened this morning for the press at Roma film festival N  io e Napoleone is easy to love First of all it can count on great production values as very few Italian films nowadays can with wonderful settings and costumes The cast is great too Director Virzì constantly speaks of the young lead Elio Germano as a young De Niro Now of course he is going a way too far but sure the boy can act I loved his performance and he did a great job with the tuscan accent Daniel Auteuil is a great actor and did very well as Bonaparte Its really great to see him acting in Italian I hope to see him working in Italy again very soon The supporting cast worked well too  people like Valerio Mastrandrea or Sabrina Impacciatore may seem unlikely choices but they all gave fine performances Even Massimo Ceccherini best known for appearing in his own moronic films and in trashy TV reality shows fitted in well and was actually funny The low point of the cast was the Diva Monica Bellucci Sure she was slightly better than usual but she managed to look and sound utterly unnatural even in the part of baronessa Emilia in which with a good dose of self irony she used her own umbro accent The script by veteran Furio Scarpelli and Virzì himself is clever with lots of laugh out loud lines and a few very emotional moments too Sure the ending left me puzzled The message is kind of ambiguous the whole film says that political ideals can bring you to blind hate but if you get closer you will learn that the object of your hate is after all a little human being like everyone else sometimes funny sometimes sad sometimes pathetic so that suddenly its difficult to hate him then in the last few minutes it says that after all it would have been better to shoot him in the head at the beginning Personally I dislike very much this notion Io e Napoleone is still a pleasant film the best presented at the Festival so far the other being Fur and the Hoax My rating is 810
1,Simon Wests pg13 thriller about a babysitter who gets disturbing prank calls while sitting at a mansion is neither original nor exciting enough to be called a good film Although there are some elements of suspense good eye candy and decent characters the film is just another I know what you did last summer as it falls short of being taken seriously The performances were alright but nothing special with this flick i say skip it unless you are looking for a mediocre movie you can find better films than this on lifetime sometimes okay maybe not lifetime but at least USA or somethin haha  710
1,Heath Ledgers acting in this film really bugs me but overall its a great watch Bryan Brown is excellent when i dont normally like him but then his whole gang are a great piece of work Jimmy is a hapless wannabe gangster who cant seem to do a thing right SPOILERS loses pandos money ackos car and nearly bumbles a bank robbery but still comes out on top didnt know what the two kids were in it for at the start but they ties some storylines together nicely all in all a damn fine piece of Australian cinema 910
1,No doubt about it This is the animated short that put Uncle Walt on the map of success When Walts older brotherRoy suggested that the next Mickey Mouse short should include sound Walt jumped at the chance The resultSteamboat Willie was a runaway hit for 1928 It was after all the first animated short subject with a synchronized sound track mostly music  sound effectsas dialog was minimal Not to sound like a wet blanket but the short is far from perfect Animation prior to 1935 was creaky  rather herky jerky but once equipment made improvementsand better artistic techniques came aboutthe rest was smooth sailingand the sound was primitive Disney wanted to use the then well known RCA Sound Systemor the Western Electric Noiseless sound systembut was refused by both firmsprompting Disney to use the Photophone system that PA Powers was experimenting with at the time The plot theres an actual plot line hereconcerns Mickey as the aforementioned Willieis the pilot of a steamboat that is terrorized by Black Pete Captain Pete to youand decides to have a jam session on ship using the various animals on board as musical instruments ASPCA take notice If you dont think too much about the technical shortcomings Steamboat Willie can be eight minutes of fun and a piece of history
1,This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White Cinderella or Bambi but it IS a very sweet enjoyable romantic welldone Disney animated feature There are of course lessons included herein for the kiddies and some very appropriate kiddiecheek but there is plenty herein for the adults as well While this is somewhat of a regurgitation of the Classic Disney RomCom Adventure it still holds some elements which solely belong to the AristoCats OMalley is the tramp and Dutchess is the lady but Dutchess has several kittens and they are all trying to get home Phil Harris is our tomcat OMalley You may recognize his voice as he also furnished the voice of Baloo the Bear in the Jungle Book and Little John in Disneys Robin Hood Eva Gabor lends her silky sweet voice to Dutchess Directed by Wolfgang Reitherman who directed or worked on every Disney animated film worth mentioning until his death in 1985 This is among my very favorite of the Disney animated feature films and belongs in any Disney collection The 2Disk Special Edition Is Due Out This Summer 2007 This rates an 8410 from the Fiend 
1,I very nearly did not see HiDeHi I think it must have been the title that put me off In those days the Welsh language editions of The Radio Times only used to print titles of certain shows without imparting a scrap of information as to what they were actually about HiDeHi suggested to me a bad quiz show hosted by Leslie Crowther or worse an inane US import But I managed to catch a later episode and was surprised to find it written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft As was the case with Dads Army and It Aint Half Hot Mum Perry based it on personal experiences in this case his time at a Butlins holiday camp Before cheap air travel came along in the 60s these camps sprang up along British coastlines providing entertainment for working class families and earning millions for their owners  As a matter of interest I worked in one such camp in the 80s as a chef  Barry Island South Wales  known to all and sundry as Shag Land for reasons I wont go into  Set in the late 50s it began with university academic Jeffrey Fairbrother  Simon Cadell  taking over as the entertainments manager of Maplins a job he was ill equipped to handle His staff included resident comic Ted Bovis  Paul Shane  his sidekick Spike  Jeffrey Holland  miserable Punch and Judy man MrPartridge  Leslie Dwyer  snobby ballroom dancers Barry  Barry Howard  and Yvonne StuartHargreaves  Diane Holland  and the unforgettable Gladys Pugh  Ruth Madoc  who lusted after Fairbrother at every opportunity Bubbly Su Pollard stole the show though as cleaner Peggy Ollerenshaw whose driving ambition was to be a Yellowcoat  all the important staff members wore them  A number of sexy girls occupied these coats too most notably Nikki Kellys Sylvia and statuesque Rikki Howards Betty We never saw Joe Maplin the owner He communicated to his staff in the form of ungrammatical missives which poor Jeffrey was forced to read aloud HiDeHi was the campers greeting usually met with the equally inane HoDeHo  One fan was the late Sir Fred Pontin who told Perry and Croft that he recognised most of the characters from real life I always found Bovis the most convincing of these as well as the most tragic like Archie Rice he was the comedian whose big break never came reduced to cracking corny gags for the amusement of drunken latenight audiences He took advantage of his position to indulge in a few perks and in one memorable episode Fairbrothers patience snapped and he sounded him out Lies Ted All lies As with every other PerryCroft series the cast were excellent particularly Cadell and Shane Ruth Madocs prissy Gladys got on my nerves  no wonder Anne Robinson hates the Welsh  but Leslie Dwyers misanthropic MrPartridge and Felix Bowness jockey Fred Qulley more than compensated  The visual gag everyone remembers is drunken MrPartridge spotting a pantomime horse riding a real one along the beach Looking at the bottle of whiskey in his hand he decides to stick with it and instead throws away the banana he had been eating  With its frothy blend of 50s nostalgia and saucy gags HiDeHi was a big hit for BBC1 in the 80s resulting in a massive increase in bookings for Butlins and Pontins It went downhill when Cadell left to return to the theatre though I never took to his replacement Squadron Leader Clive Dempster  David Griffin  Worse Leslie Dwyers death robbed the show of one of its best characters Kenneth Connor was brought in to replace him as Uncle Sammy The period setting occasionally caused problems in one episode Sylvia and Betty had to dive into the pool to rescue Peggy who for some reason was dressed as a shark The revealing costumes they wore were wrong for that era Still they looked great in them so whos complaining In another Ted sang the Tom Jones hit Delilah to campers It was not composed  by Les Reed and Barry Mason incidentally  until 1968 Maplins closed its doors in 1988 and the last shot was that of Peggy  now a Yellowcoat  all alone in the camp jumping into the air and shouting  what else  HiDeHi  I dont rate it as highly as Perry and Crofts other shows but its popularity is undeniable It was probably one of the last British sitcoms to generate tremendous public affection mainly because it featured likable characters in a recognisable setting Goodnight campers
1,I just watched this movie at the Santo Domingo International Film Festival While watching the movie I had the feeling that I have seen a movie with a similar story beforea movie with Ray Liotta but I cant remember much of it Of course this one is a lot more dramatic especially at the end This is the story Emilios life becomes a lie that he can not longer sustain After 20 years lying about his entire life to his wife son and all the people he knows the truth is chasing him and there is nowhere to go Watching Emilio make up lies is exiting and funny but after a while you get tired of the same thingthe affair with a young girl was supposed to ad something but it doesnt Despite that the movie is still funny exiting and involving Either it makes you want to help Emilio with his lies or help everybody else catch him I liked the analogies photography and the good performances 75 out of 10
1,WESTERN UNION tells in melodramatic fashion the stringing of telegraph lines between two points out west Siblings Dean Jagger and Virginia Gilmore work for Western Union and Randolph Scott and Robert Young work for the Creightons Indians and some bad white guys get in the way but nothing can stop Americas progress This sense of manifest destiny is greatly enhanced by a firstrate musical score and vibrant color photography Scott is a bank robber looking to mend his ways and both he and engineer Young vie for the attention of the perky Gilmore Lots of great character actors help keep the large production moving forward
1,In the tradition of neo film noir flicks like Chinatown this film focuses on a crime mystery in a bleak realm with a bit of character insight blended in The typical noir characters thoughout including the cop out to prove himself a damsel in distress and a bad bad guy Sharkys Machine gets a 9 out of 10 for its cinematography first plus its direction story strong character acting and superb jazz score Available on DVD though the soundtrack itself is out of print but available used on some auction sites Filmed on location in beautiful downtown Atlanta novelist Diehls hometown and the uncluttered circa 1979 look of the city would make an oldtime Atlanta citizen or visitor long for the old days before 12lane interstates crisscrossed the city a cinematographers dream at that time This was Rachel Wards first USA feature film
1,I thought this film was excellent quirky and different to the usual run of the mill disengaged cop catching serial killer film Kiefer Sutherland was brilliant as usual  I really dont think I have seen anything that he has done where he has not acted brilliantly The dialogue was funny at times lightening the mood and the plot engaging Thanks to other reviewers for showing the link with Alice in Wonderland  I hadnt picked up on those I would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of Kiefer Sutherlands as I am and to anyone who wants to watch an entertaining film for a couple of hours It was a shame that it wasnt released at the cinemas for a wider audience
1,In 1895 in a small village in Japan the wife of the litter carrier Gisaburo Takahiro Tamura Seki Kazuko Yoshiyuki has an affair with a man twentysix years younger Toyiji Tatsuya Fuji Toyiji becomes jealous of Gisaburo and plots with Seki to kill him They strangle Gisaburo and dump his body inside a well in the woods and Seki tells the locals that Gisaburo moved to Tokyo to work Three years later the locals gossip about the fate of Gisaburo and Seki is haunted by his ghost The situation becomes unbearable to Seki and Toyiji when a police authority comes to the village to investigate the disappearance of Gisaburo Ai no Borei is a surreal and supernatural love story The remorse and the guilty complex of Seki make her see the ghost of her murdered husband spoiling the perfect plot of her lover The cinematography is jeopardized by the quality of the VHS released in Brazil but there are very beautiful scenes inclusive Ringu and the American remake The Ring use the view of the well from inside in the same angle The performances and direction are excellent making Ai no Borei a great movie My vote is eight Title Brazil O Império da Paixão The Empire of Passion
1,OK A warning for anyone out there who is a parent or guardian Be careful about who you see this film with  ie  DO NOT TAKE KIDS TO SEE THIS FILM Ill explain why 1  the title is misleading and the film has nothing to do with romance  I assume this was fully intentional on the producers behalf but is annoying 2  the film itself is really very very disturbing I have some problems  first is the fact that the film is neither violent or sexual and therefore is not a horror film But it IS a very disturbing film and involves a child and his parents and a small town OK it boils down to this The film is not suitable for minors because it contains sequences and images that are unsettling and would be confusing to a child Is has a bizarre quality to it and its ONLY because it has a child in it that makes me feel its unsuitable As a parent myself I feel strongly enough to want to tell people because I read only the other day that it is having a release in theatres I hope im not offending the film makers by saying this but I think its my right because its getting a release and has an M rating onlybecause its not violent or sexual Just weird and unsettling but pretty good in and of itself
1,I am from Texas and live very close to Plano where the actual deaths occurred so I might be a bit biased in saying that Wasted is a film that you just cant get out of your head Stahl Phoenix and Paul all play their characters very realistically You truly believe that they are everyday high school students who just happen to be heroin addicts The drug content is handled very graphically as well  although everything that happens in the film serves a purpose and each moment the characters spiral further downward is heartbreaking I definitely recommend this film to anyone Once you watch it it sticks with you
1,ANOTHER great performance by Kiefer Sutherland I love his movies because he always plays his role very well For a low budget film this was done very good and kept me on the edge the whole time I love these type of movies and I was glad I caught it on Ill be buying the dvd or tape for sure 910
1,The Coens strike again I had no presuppositions going in and I was amazed at the bizarre telling of a goodbad guy story Although Clooney is easily replaceable in this his cornball style is welcome Turturro and Nelson are dead ringers And I loved I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow as performed by the Soggy Bottom Boys Catchy tune 8 of 10
1,This film isnt supposed to be funny but it made me laugh It isnt designed to be sad but my heart felt heavy through a number of the vignettes It isnt written as action adventure but my pulse raced more than once Just like life this movie doesnt manipulate your emotions and tell you how to feel It simply is and you react If you dont find it funny or sad or moving I suspect that says more about you than the film It amazing and refreshing to see a director so wholeheartedly celebrate that we are all human and embrace that we are all trapped here doing this life thing over and over for as long as we must Tomorrow is another day
1,An RKO Short Subject A group of rowdy little bullies are given a lesson in tolerance by crooner Frank Sinatra who compares America to THE HOUSE I LIVE IN This little film delivers a pertinent message about the evils of prejudice  bias Sinatra is an absolute natural in front of the camera intense  sincere he is the perfect spokesperson for the values espoused here Sinatra sings The House I Live In by Lewis Allan  Earl Robinson This fine tune with a solid proAmerican message is being given something of a comeback since the horrendous events of September 11 2001 After Pearl Harbor Hollywood went to war totally against the Axis Not only did many of the stars join up or do home front service but the output of the Studios was largely turned to the war effort The newsreels of course brought the latest war news into the neighborhood theater every week The features showcased battle stories or war related themes Even the short subjects  cartoons were used as a quick means of spreading Allied propaganda the boosting of morale or information dissemination Together Uncle Sam the American People  Hollywood proved to be an unbeatable combination
1,Being from the Buffalo area I was well aware of the movie having read many articles in local publications I was most impressed with the movie especially its clever plot the acting and the local scenes Nice to see so many older quality stars in the various roles I feel that especially those of us over 50 will find the movie excellent and you can leave the theater feeling that your time was well spent
1,great historical movie will not allow a viewer to leave once you begin to watch View is presented differently than displayed by most school books on this subject My only fault for this movie is it was photographed in black and white wished it had been in color  wow 
1,Warning Herzog is a filmaker and as such tends to be a bit overly dramatic So obsessions about closing doors may or may not be a real part of the characters life but a filmakers dramatic embellishment  or so both agreed at the premiere in San Francisco But Herzogs usual fascination with character dreams and perseverance are well suited by this story first published in Soldier of Fortune and now a full length autobiographical book The Soldier of Fortune comment brought loud boos from the politically correct SF audience and both filmaker and main character had to ensure the audience who had just seen the film that SOFs interest was misplaced  so warning this is not Rambo just survival
1,This Bravo special is one of the most purely entertaining things Ive ever seen on TV Unlike Me First  The Gimme Gimmes the worlds foremost PunkSupergroupCoverBand The Dan Band really must be seen to be appreciated On paper The Dan Band is just a onejoke act guy sings girly songs and inserts gratuitous profanity into the lyrics If you listen to their Dan Band Live CD thats all youll get and itll get old quick I only bought it because it had some songs that werent on the TV special But whats made Dan Finnerty a Hollywood cult hero is his amazing stage presence This guy OWNS his audience for every second hes onstage And the backup singers are a large part of the visual punchline as well As for the actual band they stay out of sight for the most part but are certainly much more energetic and enthusiastic than your typical loungeact backing band Hopefully a DVD version will be released soon there were almost certainly some songs cut and although the heavy censoring adds a bit of unintentional humor it also removes the INTENTIONAL humor If there is any sense in the world the Vegas casino owners will soon be fighting over who can build Dan his own showroom faster Remember my nameFAME
1,STAR RATING  Saturday Night  Friday Night  Friday Morning  Sunday Night  Monday Morning  Mr Bean Rowan Atkinson is in this world but not of this world His mind simply doesnt seem to comprehend things the way an average person would and his life is one long disaster because of this getting himself into constant mishaps and far out zany situations which he is left to sort out on his own as he doesnt seem to mix with anyone and he rarely speaks But he never gives up and despite the simplest of tasks being a constant struggle for him applying his own zany methods of solving the problem always pays off for him in the end To look at the sorry state of modern British humour with all its focus of sex and general vulgarity youd be forgiven for forgetting that a show like Mr Bean was made at one time Theres nothing unsuitable going on here just good clean U rated humour of the type Tommy Cooper and the like made in the 50s And I find it just as laugh out loud funny now in my early 20s as I did when I was a young boy in the early 90s Although I can look at it a little deeper now and see there must be more to this character than than meets the eye There must be a reason why he does things the way he does and things seem to keep going wrong for him As others have noted it looks like he may have a type of autism In fact Im so convinced about it that I really think were a professional psychologist to analyse him I think Mr Bean could be the first famous fictional character to be diagnosed with something like Aspergers Syndrome If youd like to see some truly hilarious British humour at its very best before it all became obsessed with sex and vulgarity then this would come highly recommended Shows like Little Britain do work because its well realised but its really just as vulgar as the rest Shows like this show we were more restrained and civilised once and hopefully we might start putting out this type of humour more again sometime soon 
1,I have read all of Jane Austens novels right the way through once a year every year since I was 9 years old and received the Modern Library edition of her collected works as a birthday present  I loved this movie for its romance and for the music which stayed hauntingly in my head It was an interpretation of course not an Emma or a Sense and Sensibility but something quite different and something Catherine herself would have loved And oh to be loved by this passionate Henry This was the Henry of Catherines imagination and she is the romantic heroine she read about in her novels and which was promised to us by the practical Jane Austen who tells us right at the beginning that the unlikely Catherine will indeed be one I wonder if Jane was being entirely satirical in her novel Perhaps she too could imagine such a Henry  I havent seen the film in many years at least a decade But I have been yearning for it ever since
1,Im rating this pretty high just because of Sam Elliott I couldve done without the female nudity but Id sit through almost any nonsense in order to see Sam strut his stuff He gets to spout wonderfully cynical witticisms many of which I agree with and its a joy to see him in a role in which he actually gets to emote instead of just standing around scowling and looking virile as can be My boyfriend opined that this movie is in a couple of ways similar to a film in which Ed Harris had a Hispanic partner in the police sense of the term who was a little overeager to prove himself You can draw your own conclusions on that score but if you like Sam youll like this You could say Im biased but who isnt in some way Id buy this on DVD in a heartbeat
1,Caddyshack 2 has a dreadful reputation due only to the fact that it is a sequel to a highlyheld classic People have criticised the film on a lot of grounds but they all ultimately hark back to the fact that this is not Caddyshack I would begin by saying that we should just take Caddyshack out of the equation and consider this film on its own merits but I think that would be unfair The movie does have a lot in common with its predecessor The classrelated themes of snobs versus slobs and the desire to fit in to a class above your own are as prevalent here as they were in the first movie The two things that are truly lacking here are Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield who are replaced with Dan Ackroyd and Jackie Mason respectively Now I am not about to try and argue that Ackroyd comes close to Murray in the movie but Jackie Mason is an admirable successor to Dangerfield He comes off as a cross between Dangerfield and Arnold Stang but without biting too heavily on either I wouldnt say that he is anywhere close to being as funny as Dangerfield is in Caddyshack but there is a whole lot more point to his character and his dilemma in the film Chevy Chase only pops up and handful of times in the movie which is another common complaint Maybe these particular naysayers didnt notice that he only popped up a few times in the first movie For my money his scenes here are a lot funnier if somewhat overdirected While Im on the subject it is really the overdirection of this movie that brings it down It comes across as far more selfconscious in its attempts to get a laugh Many of the jokes are laboured and theres far too much of the Gopher who seems to have taken on a far more anthropomorphic personality and a voice just in case we didnt grasp the idea that its meant to be funny Characters are similarly hammered home particularly the smarmy yuppy kids Jackie Mason rarely misses a beat and is consistently likable and very funny but we didnt need the tango sequence at all The director is clearly not of the same school of thought as Harold Ramis Not to suggest that Caddyshack was subtle but the jokes here are just a little overcooked and most of them are unnecessarily embellished with a quirky music cue All things considered this is a fun goofy movie with something to say about class and identity that very few movies at the time were saying Dont be put off by the appallingly low rating on IMDb check it out for yourself
1,This film had about everything one could wish when viewing it originally at the end of the 1960s decade It was immensely entertaining and provided a contemporary view of the many changes which had occurred during that period  and were still ongoing  in terms of the Black Power movement Vietnam and the volatile movement which followed the quieter preceding postwar 1950s All of this and one of the funniest films then or now Viewing it for the second time recently I was surprised to find it as engrossing as when seen originally Its humor is as funny and its message as strong And in viewing it now you get all of this while at the same time gaining the added enjoyment of its being a period piece and a superb chronicling of its this historic turbulent time
1,I thought that this was actually the best vampire movie that Ive ever seen Ive seen a lot too The effects were great and the casting was brilliant It was an all around good movie The makeup and costumes were great too I would recommend it but not for kids Its not a childrens movie
1,Murder Over New York is an entertaining entry in the Charlie Chan series of films but if youre paying attention a lot of plot holes reveal themselves to the observant eye While traveling to New York City for an annual police convention Chan Sidney Toler meets former Scotland Yard investigator Hugh Drake Frederick Worlock on the same flight Now employed by military intelligence Drake is tracking Paul Narvo and his Hindu servant suspected for acts of sabotage around the world Drake believes that by contacting Narvos elusive wife hell be able to pin down the whereabouts of the master criminal When Drake winds up dead in the library of George Kirby president of the Metropolitan Aircraft Corporation Charlie theorizes that he was killed by a recently discovered poisonous gas called tetrogene administered via a glass pellet that releases the poison when broken Summoning Kirby to bring all of his dinner party guests together Chan and Police Inspector Vance Donald MacBride question those in attendance as one of them may be the killer Among them are Herbert Fenton Melville Cooper a fellow Oxford student of Drakes actress June Preston Joan Valerie unknown to Drake but requested by him to attend Ralph Percy Kane Richmond the chief designer at Kirbys aircraft company and Keith Jeffrey John Sutton Kirbys stock broker Kirby butler Boggs Leyland Hodgson is also a suspect especially after Number 2 Son Jimmy Victor Sen Yung catches him steaming open a cablegram the contents of which concern Boggs himself There are some other cleverly planted characters in the proceedings as well Mrs Narvo turns up as Patricia West Marjorie Weaver and contrary to Drakes suspicion that she might lead him to Narvo is actually on the run away from her former husband and a disastrous marriage Shes involved with David Elliott Robert Lowery principal of a chemical research firm and thereby a suspect in the tetrogene angle As with many Chan films racial comments must be taken in stride with the proceedings This one offers two glaring ones When Kirbys black servant is brought in for questioning he states that he doesnt know anything about Drakes murder that hes completely in the dark Chans response Condition appear contagious Later following Inspector Vances order to round up all the Hindus in New York Jimmy Chan comments on their arrival with Theyre all beginning to look alike to me Actually the scene provides one of the elements of comic relief in the movie as Shemp Howard impersonates Hindu mystic The Great Rashid but is actually uncovered by the police to be con artist Shorty McCoy Before the movies over two more victims fall to the clever Narvo  his confederate Ramullah and aircraft magnate Kirby himself To uncover the killer Chan in concert with Elliott arranges for a test flight aboard a newly developed TR4 Bomber after discovering a poisoned capsule planted by mechanics on the plane the day before Before it can release its deadly poison the Brit Fenton catches the falling capsule in midair revealing that he knew about the plant Arrested and brought in for questioning Chan asserts that Fenton is not Narvo The real Narvo reveals himself when he offers a poisoned cup of water to the nervous Fenton anxious to maintain Narvos secret But Chan was clever enough to be wary of such an attempt and reveals the real murderer  Narvo now in the guise of stock broker Jeffrey having undergone reconstructive surgery following a car accident Now for the plot holes When first investigating Hugh Drakes murder it was maintained by the police that fingerprints found in the library did not match those of any of the dinner guests However JeffreyNarvo was present at the dinner party It had already been established that Drake had one non party visitor in the library chemist Elliott If the fingerprints really did not belong to Narvo then making them an issue was pointless Also at the end of the film when Narvo offers Fenton the poisoned water how did he think he would get away with it with everyone there as a witness But going even one better than that how would a world traveling saboteur like Narvo have the time and wherewithal to establish himself as a New York City stockbroker it just doesnt make sense  For trivia fans a few more points bear mentioning In the film Number 2 Son Jimmy is a college student studying chemistry as he comes to Pops aid to solve the case In the prior Chan film  Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum  Jimmy was a law student The poison gas formula would get reworked in a later Chan film this time by Monogram with Roland Winters in the Chan role in Docks of New Orleans In that story poison gas is released from shattered radio tubes in similar fashion to claim its victims
1,The performances by the male leads make this longhardjourney west interesting throughout The soundtrack by the Sons of The Pioneers is one of the most beautiful I have every heard The journey itself is somewhat episodic and Joanne Dru is badly miscast Overall this is a very heartwarming and heartfelt western
1,This movie literally had me rolling on the floor well at least on the couch laughing I didnt think I would like it but it came on cable TV one afternoon and I watched the whole thing and thoroughly enjoyed myself Since then Ive also seen Black Sheep which was pretty good but not as nonstopfunny as Tommy Boy
1,The plot of In the Mood for Love is simple enough A married man and a married woman though not to eachother slowly develop a romantic attachment to one another The films pace is numbingly slow and precious little actually happens between the two Yet the backdrop of Hong Kong in the early 1960s and director Wong KarWais keen sense for capturing the beauty of the setting as well as the principal characters make this film a joy to watch Actors Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung are both excellent and Wong KarWai has done an extraordinary job in capturing the feel and nostalgia of the past something so many films and directors try to do but usually fail miserably There are so many little details that add charm to the film a trademark of the director and the colors and cinematography are what send this otherwise simple story over the top as a marvelous cinematic achievement 910
1,Alright let me break it down for ya Haggard is probably one of the funniest pointless movies youll ever see Its got a mixture of a unique storyline about a guy having girl troubles and everything going backwards for him mixed in with countless humorous scenes that will keep you laughing throughout the whole movie basically if youve seen jackass or the CKY series youd know what to expect for humor considering it has most of the people from those movies Overall i just had to give it a 1010 because its one of my favorite movies of all time F0rs4k3n PS Haggard rules
1,Witticisms colorful characters family relationships coping with hardships living with fun and humor This film has it all and more What a great every man and woman story with a top notch plot and script It offers just clean fun lots of laughter many smiles and pure entertainment for the whole family Other reviewers describe the story some Ill just offer this comparison teaser  its part Best of Show Grumpy Old Men Millions and some other comedy and life flicks rolled into one This gem of a film most likely had limited release and is probably not very available to rent But its now out on DVD and I highly recommend it for purchase If you like good oldfashioned fun and entertaining films for the family you cant miss with Manna from Heaven This film is a sure fire cure for the blues or to chase the gloom away on nasty weather days or rough times
1,This movie definitely shows something and sheds light on what happens in most institutions today and shows how one gurl just with the help of her newspaper manages to get things done her editor has complete faith in her and doesnt publish something important because it would harm her friend and when it was the right time she took the necessary action The movie overall got a rating of 9 from me  because its got everything i mean it keeps you entertained and moreover they have acted really well for a TV movie its really high quality acting that deserves alot of credit
1,Garlin did a great job Nice concept well executed and tightly produced Came across as a very sincere story As a fan of Curb Your Enthusiasm where Jeff was pretty much the straight guy role I was delighted with how much depth he brought to this role in a simple yet effective portrayal Much of the humor was understated and subtle and drew on poignancy which I really liked rather than being slapstick or overexplained And there were some nice little surprises and twists The convenience store vignettes were a delight When I say it is a wonderful small film I dont mean budget or quality It is simple intimate and handcrafted It tells a highly believable everyday story Relax and go see it Let it wash over you and you will feel good for having done so
1,The Hunting Trilogy of Rabbit Fire 1951 Rabbit Seasoning 1952 and Duck Rabbit Duck 1953 should be considered the comedic high water mark of the Chuck JonesMichael Maltese collaboration While they are seldom mentioned in lists of the greatest or most important cartoons in the history of animation they are certainly THE FUNNIEST cartoons Ive ever seen Michael Maltese never got the credit that directors like Jones Freleng or Avery got but its his dialogue and situations that make Warner Bros cartoons and these three in particular some of the FUNNIEST ever made
1,Starring Kelsey Grammar Rob Schneider Lauren Holly Rip Torn This movie is a classic family favorite At least for most members of my family that is One of us rolls our eyes at the mention of this movie and thinks What a stupid movie Im not that person though I still find this movie highly amusing I just watched it again last night with someone who had never seen it and I laughed just as hard as the first time I watched it Its still very funny to me Naval Captain Tom Dodge Grammar is a bit of a black sheep in the navy Hes the kind of guy who will play golf while on a sub cracking a ball onto a golf course while they sail past it Hes the kind of guy who will get drunk pass out and wake up with a hangover and a tattoo on his dongle Hes not the kind of guy that everybody wants to be commanding a sub But Dodge is at the end of the line Hes put in applications to get command of his own sub several times and if he doesnt get a sub this time hes headed for a desk job meaning thats it for naval life The Admiralty decide to give him his own boat but they dont give him a new nuclear sub They give him a diesel sub an ancient relic from World War II His mission is to clean her up and take her out on the Atlantic for a war game Dodge is obviously a little bit frustrated to have such a crappy boat given to him when hes worked so hard to get to the point that hes at so he goes and talks to Admiral Winslow Torn about it Winslow explains the purpose of the war game Diesel subs are still being sold out there in the real world to countries like Iran Iraq and Libya to name a few Winslow wants to know what would happen if some renegade captain in a diesel sub came to the States and tried to smuggle a nuclear warhead into one of the bases Would they make it Dodge and most of the Admiralty dont think so but Winslow wants to know for sure hence why he has devised this war game Dodges mission is to take the Stingray out to sea then try to evade the US nuclear navy and blow up the American naval bases In simulated battle of course So thats about as deep as the plot gets This is not a plot driven movie Its a stupid movie that is just a big gag It makes fun of itself and you are not expected to take it seriously If youre looking for good dumb laughs on a Friday night Id urge you to check it out Bottom Line 3 out of 4 worth a look
1,Sharkys Machine is easily one of Burt Reynolds best efforts It also stands as one of the best contemporary crime dramas Erotic and violent the movie distinguishes itself by setting the story in Atlanta and delivering a chaotic detective case to youthe viewer on a silver platter Dedicated and determined Sharky must stop the murder of Dominoe a lovely lady of the night whos clientel is anything but ordinary Before long Sharkys crimefighting Machine uncovers a conspiracy of the highest order which threatens to corrupt the inner body of Atlanta As a resident of Metro Atlanta I recall the excitement in town during the movies production Sharkys Machine goes to great lengths to give an accurate portrayal of Atlanta Twenty years removed and 2000000more people later the film stands the test of time Trust me Atlanta has not changed One of the highlights of the picture is Dar Robinsons daring stunta classic symbolic ending It was even featured on Thats Incredible ABCs reality show of the period Its just too bad that Hollywood does not make enough films like this one Kick back each your popcorn and watch sterling silver cinema action
1,Hey there Army Sgt Im sorry dude but being a SGT in the Army and being in the Army National Guard does not make you qualified to comment on a Marine movie You are not a Marine and just because you wear a uniform doesnt mean you can relate to being a Marine We simply are the best we have the hardest training yes we have big heads about ourselves but hey when you are the best you like to strut your stuff I was in the Iraq invasion and in Fallujah I fought next to soldiers You are not qualified to say anything about my Marine Corps I hate to be the one that starts the whole which branch is better but you have no right to say you are qualified to judge a Marine movie Oh yeahwe are Drill Instructorsnot Drill SGTs Thats the biggest clue you have no idea about what you are talking about Yeah we do not curse at recruits anymore Tell me how is cussing at someone going to make them a better Marine How will me hitting someone make a Marine a better Marine Yes it is a kinder boot camp from what I went through But we are dealing with different times and people We are training people who are over all smarter than our generations recruits We want smarter recruits not meaner And anyone who signs up to be a Marine in the first place has a dedication to be the best his country has to offer We dont have to reinforce that in Bootcamp Marines come to Bootcamp wanting to be killers We dont need to teach them that by demoralizing them by swearing at them and beating them At least that is how I feelAnd yes I am qualified to say that I have been on the battlefield numerous times and I have trained Marines and Recruits who eventually ended up on the battlefield But then again what do I know I was just there done that got the tshirt SGT of the Armyget a clue
1,An odd beam of light penetrates the bedroom of Dr Craig BurtonArnold Voslooand his wife SherryJillian McWhirteras they are making love About two hours are unaccounted for as they embrace seemingly unharmed Under hypnosis during a session with psychiatrist Dr Susan LamarcheLindsay Crouse Craig discovers that his wife was impregnated by aliens Sherry resists this notion as absurd and is quite happy to relay news to her husband that she is indeed pregnant Ecstatic after their trying for ages to get pregnant Sherry is frightened at Craigs persistence of the fetus not being histhis stems from a check on his low sperm count with odds especially high that he could in no way have impregnated his wife Awkward troubling experiences with the fetus inside her leads Sherry to some scary discoveriesher doctor David WetherlyWilford Brimleyfinds that the ultrasound gives some unusual results of the developing infants appearance but its Craig who notices that it resembles an alien Sparks ignite cutting out the electrical equipment even shutting off Wetherlys pacemaker Through hypnosis Sherry reveals the experience of her abduction but Lamarche believes her problem is psychological not physiological With no one believing his wifes alien impregnation theory Craig turns to sociologist Dr Bert ClavellBrad Dourif whose work is in the studies of alien life and abduction But Bert is reluctant to help Craig who will go to the ends of the earth to save his wifes life from possible harm Tragic results occur as Lamarche and others try to keep Craig from his goals of cutting the thing out believing he is mad Craig will still pursue his task trying to drag Bert down this path with him Grim absorbing horror tale about one mans struggle to save his wife from the harm of beings no one else believes exist Thankfully Dourifs character isnt some quack nutjob but an intelligent doctor who wishes to learn more but his pursuit of the truth of aliens isnt hostilehe does hope to learn from Sherry but isnt incredibly demanding in this goal The story is told realisticallyits easy to understand why others might deem Craig offhisrocker Vosloo doesnt take the character too far but expresses the distress of his current situation How can he save his wife from this hostiles and prove to others that hes not nuts McWhirter deserves credit for the demands of the difficult abduction scenes where her unfortunate character is naked on this table being probed and molested by these things Crouse is fine in her limited but important role as the voice of reason in a situation where her clients seem out of control psychologically The monster effects are icky and effective I think the film works quite well and director Yuzna deserves credit for restraining himself for this film at least The final twenty minutes as Craig tries to perform his removal surgery with a scared Bert watching the crazy situation escalate is nailbiting You know fans of Fire in the Sky might dig this flick
1,This film is exceptional in that Marlene  Raymond present outstanding performances The acting in this film is the greatest strength of the production but the script direction and editing deserve applause There is an extraordinary chemistry that exsists between the two stars If you like Marlene and you like Raymond youll love this film Its a classic that compares with Casablanca 
1,This movie is not just good its amazing Besides providing us with good performances original plot fantastic special effects thoughtful messages and a lot more it was an until then completely unseen world to the public This is the first scifi movie that takes us out into the unknown space of our galaxy with such splendid effects and mind bursting reality that the audience is left without words I am only 16 years old and therefore I was raised into a world of modern effects and 3D animations in the movies But nonetheless I was really and I mean completely blown away by the quality of these effects even after almost 40 years The visual effects was just one of the merits of this movie the camera was in true Kubrick style amazing and enchanting It feels like you are consumed by the screen and sucked into this surreal world especially in the round control room or whatever you call it The effects the camera and the sheer size of this movie caught me of my guards even though I had seen the rating before I bought it But this movie has more to it than this The meaning of this movie can also be interpreted as you wish yourself even though I think there are some clear points concerning humanity also true Kubrick style How humanity on top of its evolution is just maintenance on board and therefore not needed by the computer one of humanities tools How we in space appear like babies learning to walk once more losing control of our tools in zerogravity breathing through equipment as fish out of water On the peak of evolution we set out into the neverending adventure as simple primates Many might think that the length and slow pace of this movie is boring ridicules or just a waste of time But before you can jump to those conclusions think about why Kubrick spends time with calm music and a spaceship in the middle of space for several minutes This is to illustrate the beauty of it Beauty beauty is in many cases not granted the rightful respect by viewers Kubrick wants to show us beauty and if we do not succumb to it and relax we can not enjoy this film as it was intended This is not an ordinary movie we can not just sit and watch as we can with some other movies this requires time thoughts and above all commitment and feelings to watch All of this together makes this one of the greatest achievements in the world of moving pictures 1010 Let me know if you agree with me
1,The Long Kiss Goodnight is an enjoyable and very cool action thriller and a career breakthrough for Geena Davis The plot is very familiar to that of The Bourne Identity but so what The fight scenes are a real treat for the eyes and the plotline is strong enough to keep you engaged for the 2 hours Its directed with a slick sense of style and avoids most action cliches Geena Davis is great as an action chick and gets past her usual good wife role Samuel L Jackson is good as usual as the supporting player The films baddie is overly cheesy though and you can tell whats going to happen to him  It breaks away from the usual runofthemill actioners such as Commando and On Deadly Ground and is definetly one of the best actioners in years Good fun and good popcorn entertainment 7410
1,In Fassbinders earlier films his ideas sometimes surpased his ability to execute them He was always a great writer but it took him some time to get his style of camera work and storytelling down pat The Merchant of Four Seasons is one of Fassbinders first movie to make great use of color from the bright green pears in the merchants cart to the bright red roses at the funeral a funeral in a Fassbinder movie whod have thought His camera work was getting there too but it was still fairly minimalist The occasional zooms seem a bit uncomfortable at times and unnatural but then again Fassbinder was still coming out of his purely avant garde phase This might be because Michael Ballhaus isnt behind the camera but instead the slightly inferior Dietrich Lohmann Still this is Fassbinder and you get your fix here Broken dreams shown so vividly and unflinchingly as to alienate audience and drive them into a depressed stupor Just what the doctor ordered An early classic that shows remarkable progression when compared to his first films released only 2 years prior
1,The Falcon and the Snowman is the story of two young men a CIA employee and a drug dealer who become disenchanted with United States foreign policy and sell state secrets to the Soviet Union The events of the film are based on a true story Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn are convincing in the lead parts and develop interesting characterizations The supporting cast also performs well notably with a performance from David Suchet of Hercule Poirot fame as a seasoned Soviet agent The film is generally effective at setting out its premise and developing it and giving a sense of two boys caught in something they did not properly understand going in However it does seem overlong and cumbersome at points in the middle The ending however is tense stunning and effective There are some catchy rock songs included in the soundtrack but also unfortunately a repeated mellow synthesizer track that doesnt fit with a spy story There are other spy films more worth seeking out than The Falcon and the Snowman but it is a decent film none the less
1,When A Stranger Calls is actually a pretty good movie I had never saw the original and so when I watched this I thought it was unique When When A Stranger Calls was advertised on the television the trailer gave away the ending Well I never saw the trailer so when I saw this film I was surprised at how good it turned out to be I walked by it one day and decided Id buy it and now Im lucky I did because I thought it was a very pleasing movie that is a nice little film to own It is getting a lot of unfair treatment and if youre interested in this movie at all dont listen to all the negativity Camille Belle is not as bad of an actress as everyone makes her out to be and she did a great job in this movie so all you haters get over yourselves lighten up and actually try to enjoy this movie for what it is A fun teeny bopper popcorn flick If you havent seen it please do for it is a lot more enjoyable than a lot of the other slashers being made recently
1,Like an earlier commentor I saw it in 1980 and have never been able to shake the memory of the gripping story splendid acting and dramatic musical score It certainly contains some of Sam Waterstons finest work He and the writers depict Oppenheimer not simply as an unjustly victimized hero  which he was  but also as naive fond of alcohol and snobbish a rounded portrait instead of a stereotype
1,Its just stories some we wish happen to us some we wish never happen to us all about unfulfilled desire The locations and nude bodies are beautiful but after the second story all I could think was it takes more than just beauty to create a real film Then of course the film unfolds The stories are moving except Sophie Marceau fails to communicate her story in this film Malkovich plays the story for both of them though The voiceover fails to link the stories but helps Malkovich to provoke some thought Id say it is worth seeing and the best of Antonioni I have seen Given his age  remarkable
1,The ultimate gritty heist film Elements of Bogie Welles  Sinatra will leave you sweating  satisfied In comparison it really upsets the proverbial apple cart to see recent films such as Oceans Eleven remake reviewed in such high regardespecially in Europe Films like Rififi must be shown spoke about and kept alive to remind younger pathetic critics what true classic Noir is Criterion should be commended in their flawless and classy transfer

1,From director Billy Wilder Double Indemnity The Seven Year Itch Some Like It Hot I can see that this is a bit of an undershown and underrated film one to be seen This is the biographical story of Charles Augustus Slim Lindbergh James Stewart who in 1927 wanted to be the first man to cross travel solo flight from New York crossing the Atlantic ocean to reach Paris in a small cockpit The first half hour or whatever is seeing Lindbergh getting permission to do it and the construction of the plane named The Spirit of St Louis and making all necessary preparations Then of course the rest sees his perilous journey crossing the journey overcoming tiredness near fuel loss and moments of losing sense of direction but he was successful Also starring Murray Hamilton as Bud Gurney Patricia Smith as Mirror Girl Bartlett Robinson as Benjamin Frank Mahoney Robert Cornthwaite as Harry Knight Sheila Bond as ModelDancer Marc Connelly as Father Hussman Arthur Space as Donald Hall Harlan Warde as Boedecker and Dabbs Greer as Goldsborough Apparently Lindbergh was a bit younger so Stewart was a shade too old to play him but then again you cant think of anyone else that could do better It is a witty and emotional drama with Stewart as always being fantastic great music score by Frank Waxman and good direction from Wilder a good little known gem It was nominated the Oscar for Best Special Effects the only award it was ever nominated James Stewart was number 12 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars he was number 3 on 100 Years 100 Stars  Men and he was number 13 on The Worlds Greatest Actor Very good
1,Everything that you need to know about the pornography of the late 70s and early 80s is all wrapped up in Paul Thomas Andersons BOOGIE NIGHTS Although the film is completely fictional it is actually supposedly based on the story of porno kingpin John Holmes In Southern California in 1977 Eddie Adams Mark Wahlberg is working as a busboy in a nightclub One of the regular customers is pornographer Jack Horner Burt Reynolds and two of his starlets Amber Waves Julianne Moore and Rollergirl Heather Graham Jack and Eddie meet and Jack realizes that Eddie is wella littlegifted So Eddie stars in Jacks films under the pseudonym of Dirk Diggler He becomes a big porno star no pun intended and seems to be on top of everything Then comes the 80s when video replaces film and Jacks porno empire begins to collapse along with Dirk Diggler and everybody else working in the field BOOGIE NIGHTS is a really wellfilmed drama There is a little bit of violence but PT Anderson makes it more stylized And it kind of is a scathing approach to the degradations of pornography especially when VHS became the standard medium for making pornos A lot of bizarre and unique characters are introduced William H Macy has an interesting role as someone working on the films whose wife keeps having sex with everybody I especially liked Don Cheadles role as Buck the stereo salesman The best performance is BOOGIE NIGHTS was definitely Burt Reynolds A 90s classic
1,The movie was fantastic If your a fan of Bams cky videos jackass or his show Viva la Bam you cant help but like it I have a few friends who arent fans that enjoyed it and others who thought it wasnt that great Those who didnt like it were mostly female friends they really didnt appreciate some of the crude humor that personally i think made the movie so funny Im pretty sure the entire movie was filmed in Bams home town which includes a lot of his regularly visited locations The cast of is made up of all his friends and cky buddies and also includes some big name pro skateboarders too The soundtrack is phenomenal with music by HIM In my opinion Haggard has it all A great plot characters youll never see anywhere else Plenty of humor great music and a cast that was dedicated to the project
1,Spoiler begin The movie focuses on three friends Samantha Summer Phoenix Chris Nick Stahl and Owen Aaron Paul The movie starts out with Sam and Owen as the drug addicts and Chris the track star as the one who takes care of them As things get increasingly worse at home for Chris he asks Sam what the drug is like Sam is out of rehab and sober by this point and tells him it makes everything better Chris then catches up with Owen and they start using It takes chris two times till he is a  full time member After some trouble with a dealer and a confession to Sam she gets in again So begins the downward spiral for them Chris ods when he breaks a promise to Sam I want some of the movie to be a surprise He dies Sam gets in to college to be an Architect and Owen gets arrested so ends the story Spoiler ends minor spoilers throughout Nick stahl is amazing He will have an Oscar one day His portrayal of Chris was Heartbreaking He was the only one that felt real in the movie as far as drug use goes Aaron Paul who played Owen acted as if he were on speed not heroin Summer Phoenix was fine she is talented but what can i say Nick Stahl stole the movie His drugged eyes his slow movements everything was perfect  The writers needed to show withdrawls in the movie That is a main reason why people dont want to quit Other then that there are hilarious scenes the mall scene and the Backstreet boy sceneman Stahl nailed the reactions right on the head Touching sad scenes Like the scene between Sam and Chris in her bedroom after he gets beat up i bawled and the park scene It was realistic too Like S am using again when Chris wanted to flush the drug down the toilet and Chris using again after he goes to Owns even though he had been clean for two weeks the pull was too strong it is all realistic  Watch the movie for a great cast great music and a semi truthful account of drug addiction
1,It was high time a movie about the situation in a largely ignored Asian country like Myanmar had to be made and Beyond Rangoon is Hollywoods answer Initially I thought Hollywood would dramatize the events of the 8888 uprising and add in the traditionally Hollywood spice of Titanictype love between the lead heroine and the Burmese male lead who happens to be an old man Thankfully nothing of that sort was in place  which may also explain why the film was not financially successful Anyway the film was honesttoGod and I was glad at the accuracy of events portrayed Apart from the fact that filming was done outside of Myanmar in Malaysia  Thailand and that I missed the exotic Burmese locales I could not find much fault in the film You cannot blame the film for the desperation of the people and the resulting overwhelming actions It is after all real events of a civil war The music by Hans Zimmer is definitely the USP of an otherwise adventurous tragedy for people who have no connection to it I was only a year old in Rangoon now Yangon during this tumultuous time When I heard a movie was made on my reallife experience which I was too young to absorb I had to get the DVD and needless to say I could hardly have any complaints about it as it is an eyeopening wonder for me

1,Carly Jones Elisha Curtberth her bad boy brother Nick Chad Michael Murray her boyfriend Wade Jared Padalecki and her friends Paige Paris Hilton and her boyfriend Blake Robert Richard and Dalton Jon Abrahams travel to another city to watch an important game They decide to camp in a field halfway and proceed their journey on the next day However the fan belt of Wades car breaks and he stays with Carly to buy a new one in a close town where there is a house of wax When they arrive in the place they realize that the place is a ghost town and two deranged former Siamese brothers have transformed people in wax statues I liked this House of Wax indeed a worthwhile teen horror movie The story follows the standards of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and other slash movies and it is well made has a good team of actors and actresses and special effects and the death scenes are amazing Even if the movie were not good watching the sexy and delicious Paris Hilton is worth My vote is seven Title Brazil A Casa de Cera The House of Wax
1,I was at school in the late sixties and early seventies and this film is very much how my school was The school play where the leading actors kiss that happened at my school A crazy gang of lads my school again only when we went on a cross country run we would have a smoke Getting the whack some one at my school broke in through a sky light and broke the canes after that they were kept in a safe And as for certain nocternal activities what can I say The film actually came out in 1982 I remember that as it was when I bought my house and the film was showing at the same time If you like British films and films about school growing up and period pieces then this is for you Another film very much like it SWALK came out a few years before and I for one would like to see that again also Kes is in the genre Highly recommended But trust me 1982 is when it came out

1,It is always difficult to bring a 450 pages book down to a three hours film I read the book before and I found the BBC production dealing with this difficulty in the best way possible The qualities of the book havent been lost the dense and lively depiction of a fingersmith patchwork family in London in the 1860s the cold and obscene cruelty in which Maud is brought up the characterization of different social groups by different ways of speaking the unexpected and surprising twists of the story the way the film makes the spectators look different at the same scenes when they are told first from Sues point of view then from Mauds one The main actors do very good and especially the growing love between the two women is convincingly developed with a first culmination in a very tender love scene between the two and finally forgiving all the evil they were ready to do and did to each other because they still love each other For each of her books the author Sarah Waters has thoroughly investigated what life was like in British 19th century While in Tipping the Velvet it was the world of the vaudeville theaters and the beginning of social movements in Affinity the dreadful reality of women penitentiaries and the fashionable evocation of spirits in Fingersmith she depicts the public ceremony of hanging people in London and the inhuman treatment of persons supposed or declared disturbed in asylums based on the reading of sources and scientific research This is very well transferred to the film so that the corresponding scenes show a high grade of historic truth I highly recommend this film production because it offers three hours of colorful Victorian atmosphere vivid emotions and suspense
1,For once a sequel to The Karate Kid without Ralph Macchio Hilary Swank did an excellent job playing the orphan Julie Pierce Pat Morita the one who plays Mr Miyagi worked his way with Julie quite different from Daniel Both Daniel and Julie favored karate Unlike Daniel Julie was the most surly person Miyagi ever challenged And there was no tournament to compete in And theres gonna be some humor in this movie as well I liked the part where when Julie came home from school Miyagi went to check on her and saw her change clothes in the process That was very funny And the classic Wax on Wax off scene was different as well It was funny when Miyagi tells Julie Uhoh missed spot The set in Boston was a far cry from California The Militant group in that group was like the Cobra Kai in Boston And Michael Ironsides Col Dugan was no John Kreese His group practically deserted him when Julie kicked some serious butt They all paid the price when they blew up that classic Oldsmoblie What a cowardly act At least theyll find redemption from Dugans poison This Karate Kid sets some morals unlike the last three which talked about Honor and Respect Hilary Swank is outstandingly hot in any movie and everything else she does Movie 9 Hilary Swank 10
1,This is one of the best lesbian films i have ever seen This series brought joy and sadness of true love Being set in the 1800s was an amazing look at lesbian lives and desires of lesbian women The cast was beyond expectation Rachael Stirling is an amazing actress i have never seen her other works but her portrayal of Nan made me connect with her feeling her heartache and pains and love The one thing i feel most important is connecting with the characters in anything i watch If anyone has doubts on seeing this filmThink twice This is a must see series Well done again to BBC We need more lesbian films that portrays real love and hurts like this one Living in Canada i had this DVD imported and i am so thrilled to have purchased it
1,While caricatures andor references to entertainment industry people or things or even brands of products is usually a staple in shorts like this one they arent used in quantity here Most of the individual gags are rather generic As Im going to give examples there will be spoilers below  There are only three well technically fourtheres a quick one at the very end of the cartoon caricatures that I spotted which is kind of low for this type of short though one is a featured character with a fair amount of activity They are Jack Benny as Jack Bunny Leopold Stowkowski and the inimitable Ned Sparks as a crab on a canchances are very good that if a crab was involved in a Warner Brothers short in the 1930s1940s the caricature used would be Ned Sparks There are also references to Billy Roses Aquacade and a riff on a radio show character called Henry Aldrich Coming mother a play on Superman Superguy here and the villain is a takeoff on King Kong Thats it for that kind of gag The products themselves are mostly generic and the gags are more plays on basic items in unusual situations such as turtles coming off of cans of soup to attack the villain as tanks tomato soup cans doing The cancan gingerbread men who turn into paratroopers using tissues for parachutes and so on The gags are very good and its an excellent example of a Bob Clampett cartoon Clampett had hit his stride as a director by this point and while it isnt anywhere near his best work its nothing to sneeze at either This short can be found on Looney Tunes Golden Collection Vol 3 which is an excellent set that I highly recommend This short itself is also recommended
1,SPOILER ALERT PLEASE DONT READ IF YOU DONT WANT THE MOVIE SPOILED I was originally planning on seeing this movie this past weekend but my plans ended up making me unable to have time to see it So me  my friend made plans to see it after school today Boy are we glad we did The movie starts off in Italy with a planned heist with a group of guys Charlie Croker Mark Whalberg Steve Frezelli Edward Norton Lyle also known as Napster Seth Green youll get the nickname later Handsome Rob Jason Statham Left Ear Mos Deaf  John Bridger Donald Sutherland plan a heist to steal 32 gold bricks This leads to the whole opening which is a good 10 to 15 minutes and involves a boat chase which opens the movie up right While driving away in their get away van Steve Frezelli turns on the group steals the gold and kills John Bridger who is pretty much the retiring leader of the group Fast foward to a year later where where Stella Bridger Charlize Theron Johns daughter is one of the top safecrackers that anyone can ask for Charlie Croker who was actually indirectly responsible for her fathers death as he called him out of retirement for the heist says that theyve found Steve who has gone into hiding and want to get back at him for what he did She at first declines but later agrees and the teamgets back together along with getting the help of Wrench Franky G a mechanic to carry out the perfect heist while creating one of the largest traffic jams in Los Angeles history This movie is a perfect mix of action with funny bits thrown in throughout Theres an onrunning joke about Seth Greens character Lyle creating Napster and how Shawn Fanning who makes a cameo stole it while he fell asleep and eventually Lyle will only answer if refered to as Napster Theres even a funny line in the movie by Seth who goes He said in an interview he called it Napster because it described his hair like it was nappy He callled it that because I was napping when he stole it The begining and ending sequences are pure genius and everything in between fits perfectly The only negative thing I can think of with the movie is that Edward Nortons acting was a bit weak He wasnt a big tough bad guy He acted like he was being paid and just doing the bareminimum which is a fact as he was forced to do this movie due to contractual obligation But even with that problem being the only real gripe with the film the movie is still very enjoyable and I definetly recommend seeing it And even if youre not interested in the actual movie go to see Seth Green shine in the comedic role Hes perfect Rating  out of 
1,I couldnt believe that the Adult Swim guys came up with this character I laughed for days just thinking about this show Having finally seen the pilot I guess I will stick around for a few more episodes Assy is pretty funny and the whole crew of police show characters are around but Assy is hard to understand and that was a little frustrating Most of the humor revolves around the fact that the title character is literally a walking ass with nothing else but legs that sport socks with garters and feet with traditional wing tips Assy drinks too much and plays by his own rules as you might have guessed The only other funny moments are Assy shooting manymany people and spending time at home  in the bathroom It is not Squidbillies funny but it is worth a look

1,The End of Suburbia as it should appeal to general citizens  mass consumers alike is likely to become of cultural reform status The film uses supercynical analysis by authors policy makers and social philosophers on the paradox created by SuburbanStyle livingmainly in the PostWar era What we have created in America is a place with none of the amenities of country life and none of the amenities of urban city life This is the prescription that is laid out for suburbia and the film focuss on the singular idea of Oil Basically in the most general sense that the world is nearing or at its peak oil production and when we realize this in full major lifestyle changes will be in effect whether by our best interest or forced violently upon us by a quality of living even the slumdwellers of Calcutta couldnt describe to us If nothing more the end of Suburbia will siphon the viewer flush in their gut creating a sickening feeling This is bound to happen Its a bleak outlook on our inherent way of life The ambivalence lies particularly in each respective viewers critical analysis of the film I foresee many unprepared viewers slandering the film as smug liberal propagandalike a Michale Moore film What they fail to consider is that a reaction like this is all too normal when such a message hits so unbelievably hard to the lifestyle of the vast majority of the masses This is the truth and as a student studying City Planning I can tell you that we better get prepared now because what slim chance we have of maintaining quality of life in this dwindling cesspool of tampered resources is fading faster than a race of people stricken by the black plague
1,Uproarious nobrainer comedy in which comedian Mark Blankfield portrays Jekyll as an uptight doctor deeply committed to his research Once hes snorted his experimental formula hes turned into the scenerydevouring Hyde causing no end of problems for everybody around him I was pleasantly surprised by this one It has a truly insane madcap approach its full steam ahead with one outrageously stupid yet undeniably hilarious joke after another Funny lines and sight gags are in abundance Blankfield plays each role for all its worth One highlight has Hyde bursting into song Hydes Got Nothing to Hyde is quite catchy and even now I can still hear it in my head The climax even goes so far as to spoof old b  w horror films The supporting cast is quite spirited as well with Bess Armstrong as the ditzy fiancée Mary Krista Errickson as the spunky Ivy and Tim Thomerson as flamboyant fellow doctor Knute Lanyon I do wish more could have been done with Thomersons character as Im a fan of the man but its always nice to see him in something A large array of familiar faces parade before the camera Cassandra Elvira Peterson Peter Brocco Liz Sheridan George Wendt Michael Ensign John Dennis Johnston Art La Fleur Lin Shaye and George Chakiris in a cameo as himself It goes without saying that if you prefer highbrow intelligent comedy youd better avoid this one at all costs But for those who enjoy a zany politically incorrect gleefully raunchy good time this just might do the trick One of the best bits is saved for last 810
1,Yes I felt like I had been gutted after first seeing it But not until the next day did I begin to see the true brilliance of this creation I wont repeat much of what has already been said by those who appreciate the film but there is one new area I want to touch on SPOILERS Why exactly did the teacher put the broken glass in the students pocket Most reviewers have noted that it only reflected her cruelty and reaction to an unsatisfactory performance I must disagree Watch the scene again Huppert is moved to tears as she watches her student playing on stage The student is quite an expressive girl crying  vocalizing her fears just the opposite of Hupperts character There is a scene later in the film after the girl is injured when Huppert discusses the accident with the girls mother The mother visibly upset states We gave up everything so she could study piano and Huppert immediately snaps You mean SHE gave up everything dont you So it was my thought that Huppert was simply saving this young expressive student from her own destiny She didnt want the girl to end up like HER repressed  hardened condemned to a life of recitalsgradually killing the soul in the pursuit of perfection Maybe she saw herself on the stage years ago before things grew bad Maybe she wished she had escaped when she was that age Is she ruining the students life or simply freeing her For me that realization made all the difference in what I experienced through this film Brilliant
1,This production was quite well done for a television original providing a very appropriate original slant on Swifts work To make the frame story work well the film begins with Gulliver arriving home Everyone who has read the book knows that will happen anyway The frame story of the book has Gullivers crazed confusion in sections For example he is horrified that he will trample little people in England because he has just returned from a land of giants But the film has all the book sections within one long voyage When Gulliver narrates his travels the editing cuts from England to the travel are very effective I confess I found them intrusive and irritating at first then they became natural By the end moreover they have become a welcome addition to the story As he tells his adventures to a larger and larger audience more and more people listen to his compelling fantasy even though they doubt its truth For example his hatred of filthy Yahoos and admiration of pure logic from the fourth section comes across well when he is defending his own sanity The intercuts between events in England and similar events or scenes in the tale is very effective For example ripping the cloth from the table to suggest the motion of towing a group of ships is inspired filming The addition of Gullivers family threatened by the lecherous doctor works well Swift only hints at this by having the longsuffering wife protest against further voyages It becomes a natural part of this story The casting and acting were competent throughout Some roles were exemplary Omar Sharifs mad magician is superb OTooles little emperor is doddering delightfully toward senility Many specific complaints made by other writers here strike me as simple personal preference which after all is what we are about here I read the abridged version several times a year from fourth grade on I may have escaped the complete version until a college class but have read it a few times since And I had to start it again as I began reading about this film While the Danson version is superior to any previous film it does not replace the book However I think it will bring many readers to the book If you have not read the book enjoy this movie then go to the source If you appreciate the satire in it find Swifts A Modest Proposal and his Drapiers Letters Both are satires attacking the wretched treatment of Ireland and the Irish during Swifts time The drapier protests cheap inflated copper coins being dumped on Ireland These were Woods light weight coinage not good for face value in paying taxes and official debts The outcry from Swifts satire caused the coins to be sent to another mistreated British territory the American colonies The universal satire in Swifts book and this movie just poke fun they cannot change human nature Give Dansons torturous experiences a chance I think you will find them thought provoking and entertaining
1,This short film and the poem which is behind it is one of the greatest metaphors Ive ever seen  The poem is beautiful It describes exactly the feeling of a person that chases a dream and cant realize it but it also tells how to fulfil it I see the Story of the Cat and the Moon as one beautiful metaphor to the Human relationships passion and love  Technically its done a good work too In spite of being very simple the animation in black and white gives a tone of allegory to the movie and to its message but also of tenderness and nostalgia  In addiction the music also contributes to this poetic feeling  Nothing else matters I will wait She will come when she can or when she wants to
1,Challenge to be Free was one of the first films I saw as a child It was also one of the first VHS tapes that I owned I hadnt seen the movie in years so yesterday I decided to stick the tape in and watch it Wow The story is as powerful now as it was the first time I saw it I think now that I am older I can better apreciate the values that are implanted in the movie Selfreliance The value of Freedom and the love of nature It is a B movie to be sure but its one that youll remember for years especially if you see it as a child
1,This movie brings back so many memories for me I was very young when it came out but I remember the first time I saw it My dad and I would always watch the Ernest Movies together We hadnt seen any of them in several years and I found a couple of them really cheap We watched them and could not stop laughing I love all of the Ernest Movies but this one is my favorite Spoiler part  The part I remember most is the magnet part My dad still does the electric chair scene  End Spoiler This is a very cheesy moviebut a great one Its perfect for families it isnt like a lot of the trash out there but at the same time adults can laugh too If you like physical humor like facial expressions and the way people move then this is the movie for you
1,It has been widely agreed that Hayao Miyazaki is a master at his craft when it comes to combining rich animation with thoughtful story lines and similarly imaginative characters His movies from NAUSICAA TOTORO KIKI LAPUTA and MONONOKE to the recent HOWLS MOVING CASTLE are all not only gorgeously rendered in terms of art but in terms of moviemaking as well Can this man do no wrong Not really but it is impossible to expect everyone of his movies to always be five star marvels His newest film PONYO an unashamedly familyfriendly tale of a goldfish out of water is as lushly animated and alive with interesting characters as you would expect and yet this is the first film of his which treads into lesser territory Dont get me wrong PONYO is not a bad movie by any means As mentioned it is a sight for the eyes and is as charming and adorable as TOTORO and KIKI The problem is that the story doesnt stay afloat to satisfy anyone eager for another engrossing indepth plot For its opening hour PONYO is Miyazaki storytelling at its finest in which a rowdy and overeager young goldfish who later becomes named Ponyo makes a forbidden trip to the human world where she is subsequently adopted by a boy her own age named Sosuke modeled interestingly after the directors own son This does not please Ponyos father a mysterious wizard named Fujimoto who is very angry at the humans for their destruction of the sea this environmentalist theme is not much different from Miyazakis other films a problem he very much intends to rectify by creating jellyfish from the prow of his submarine He separates the pair and tries to talk Ponyo into staying underwater with him The goldfish however has already tasted both Sosukes blood healing a cut on his finger AND some of the human food ham which she becomes inexplicably addicted to and of course steals into her fathers forbidden potions transforming into a hyperactive young girl who is the spitting image of Mei from MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO This triggers a dangerous tsunami which threatens to engulf the entire world with water Conspiring with his wife Gran Mamare a diaphanous sea goddess who alternatingly shifts from supersized titan to humansize form Fujimoto decides to test the two youngsters love for each other They do this by elevating the sea to the level of Sosukes house prompting the youngsters to set out across their now oceaninfested world in an oversized toyboat made possible by Ponyos own magical powers It is at this point where PONYO begins to run out of steam Although Ponyo and Sosuke are adorable and the scenes involving them are funny and cute they slow down the film Where the film really takes on water unfortunately is at the climax in which Sosuke must prove his love to Ponyo presented in a way which is strangely anticlimactic and rushed bringing an otherwise charming tale to an abrupt halt This will likely underwhelm viewers expecting another instant masterpiece from the man who has delivered far more interesting finales for many of his other movies Remember the destruction of Laputa Satsukis search for little Mei Kikis rescue of Tombo Porco Rossos fight with Curtis The rescue of the Forest Spirits head Or even the test between Chihiro and Yubaba All those resolutions were far more satisfying and felt more complete than this one On a technical level PONYO cannot be faulted The animation is absolutely gorgeous to look at produced entirely without a single shot of computergeneratedimagery and naturally Joe Hisaishi provides us with yet another breathtaking musical score the best moments being the rousing sequences underwater accompanied by a chorus and a soprano voice And the backgrounds are lovingly painted and detailed as any other Ghibli movies Having proved themselves worthy on translating and dubbing Ghiblis previous movies into English with topquality results Disney Studios and Pixar once again provide an English dub complete with a mostly capable cast of actors Frankie Jonas is surprisingly good as Sosuke sounding very natural and believable throughout Noah Cyrus as Ponyo on the other hand sometimes goes overboard in shouting her lines before eventually settling down toward the end Leads aside the rest of the cast includes Liam Neeson as the overprotective Fujimoto who manages himself unsurprisingly well in the character Cate Blanchett as Gran Mamare in an omnipresent tone which is not much different from her Galadriel in LORD OF THE RINGS Matt Damon as Sosukes constantly seafaring father Koichi who is good but nothing to write home about and Tina Fey as Lisa Of them Fey is the best voice in the entire cast imbuing the character with just the right amount of spirit and personality Her scenes with Sosuke show real chemistry On the other hand Cloris Leachman who was spectacular as Dola in CASTLE IN THE SKY is disappointingly wasted as one of three handicapped elderly women she barely has ANY lines who are also voiced by Betty White and Lily Tomlin Of them only Tomlins character a cantankerous woman named Toki shows any real personality but if I were casting the movie Id switch Tomlin with Leachman Probably the only really jarring drawback of the dub is a blasty technoremix of the films catchy but ridiculously repetitive title song which thankfully doesnt occur until midway through the closing credits On the whole PONYO is a good film a fine piece of animated work which is perfect for youngsters and family audiences Due to the loss of momentum toward the end though it falls far short of classic status Since Miyazaki at his least is still better than a majority of other animated films though Ill be generous and give PONYO a full star recommendation because any feature of his is still very much worth watching particularly on the big screen Be sure to catch it in the theaters while you can

1,Fires on The Plain 1959  You dont see films like this anymore Fires on the Plain is an incredible depiction of the lives of the soldiers of the Japanese Imperial Army Kon Ichikawas masterpiece follows Tamura a soldier with Tuberculosis as he wanders around the Philippine landscape in the last year of the war He is sent away to the hospital by his commanding officer only to be refused treatment and so he is sent back His CO tells him to go back and if they refuse him again then his last order is to kill himself with his grenade He is refused again but meets up with a band of squatters sitting outside the hospital The next day they are shelled by American troops and Tamura flees choosing not to kill himself and from there he wanders from place to place trying to get to Palompon He discovers that some men have been eating human flesh in order to survive while others trade as much tobacco as they can for whatever they can get back The film is filled with a quiet sense of desperation and desolation with a hint of insanity Everyone we see is skin and bones covered in dirt wearing torn and tattered rags Ichikawa uses his camera to catch some beautiful shots of the destructed landscape and the Japanese soldiers who walk it Kon Ichikawa was famous in Japan for making many comedies and satires and there are moments in Fires on the Plain that are bitingly hilarious Take for example a shot of what appears to be a dead man lying face down in a pool of water a soldier walks but and asks himself aloud if that is how they will all end up to which the man lifts his head out of the water and replies what was that and then drops his face even deeper into the puddle than before Another hilarious sequence involves one man finding a pair of boots along the trail He takes the boots replacing them with his old ones Another man walks by and sees that pair of boots and switches up for his old boots The scene continues until finally Tamura finds the exchange spot and examines the boots left without hardly any sole He looks carefully at his own and at ones on the ground and deciding that theyre both kaput he removes his own and goes barefoot The film is filled with incredible scenes one after another Like Mizoguchi and Kurosawa Ichikawa knew how to use his camera to paint beautiful and stunning pictures There are many stunning shots of men in barren empty plains surrounded by nothing but smoke in the air and dead or dying bodies on the broken earth There is another incredible scene where dozens of Japanese soldiers attempt to cross a road guarded by Yanks in the middle of the night all crawling on their hands and knees as the camera watches on from above  The film gets its name from the columns of smoke rising up from fires on the plains seen throughout the film They represent to the soldiers life a little more ordinary the lives of Japanese farmers back home burning husks of corn Their beacons of hope for the normal life however are in hostile hands The film caused a stir in its day with its graphic content Much emphasis is placed on the horror of war not just with the enemy but within your ranks and yourself Kon Ichikawas Fires on the Plains is an incredibly authentic and moving and somewhat disturbing portrait of the horror suffered by the men making up the lower ranks of the Imperial Army Clint Eastwoods Letters From Iwo Jima while it is a very good film comes nowhere close to realizing the horror of war depicted in Fires on the Plain Eastwood was no doubt influenced by the film seeing as he claims to be such a classic Japanese film buff Many war films show that war is hell through the eyes of the winners In Fires on the Plain were shown that war is even more hellish when youre on the losing end  44
1,Some people dont appreciate the magical elements in ROSbut they are what sets this series apart that and the fact the producers actually decided to dress the actors in proper period clothes and armournot anachronistic feathered capsmulticoloured tights and plate armour But I am really writing to comment on an earlier posters article Um Michael Praed did not leave ROS to do Jules Verne There are 15 years between these two series Yup I agree and Michael might well agree too that leaving ROS was not a good movebut it was a coveted Broadway role that tempted him in 84 and then Dynasty with its megabucks paychecks
1,I agree with the guy above It is so funny I understand it all but my friends just dont get it Go to Japan and you will see a different movie after being there When I met my girlfriends dad at his home in Kanagawa I swear I felt the same as Jack scared but by the end of the day it was all good so I give this movie a 10 out 10 I have watched it at least 30 times taking it with me to watch on the plane flying to Japan next month One thing that is real good is the ball game scenes Makes me feel like I am there again This is a must see if you have any interest in Japan and Baseball Too bad they dont make a sequel Does anyone know where the temple scenes were filmed and the argument with hirko in the walkway with a roof on it need to know so I can win an argumrnt with me Japanese exwife thanks
1,cool flick enjoyable to watch hope to see more from Fred Carpenter soon i really like the location setting with all the new york references it was interesting the way it all unfolds in the end the suspense factor was effective and the acting though kept simple was also effective in portraying the characters there are a bunch of neat little tricks incorporated into this film that make all the better i think the supporting actress did a great job in her role the casting and directing in this film seem to be sewn together seamlessly and the quality of the shooting is quite impressive the movie is not without its soft moments either which gives it a nice sense of balance
1,I really liked the first part of this film in Africa for about an hour or so until the animal cruelty by civilized humans in Scotland got to me in the second half and made me so sad I couldnt watch some of it However this was done by the filmmaker to make a point that early natural scientists ruined everything alive they didnt understand by studying it literally to death without considering the rights and comfort of the animals studied which we know now shouldnt be studied anywhere but in the natural world they inhabit and as unobtrusively as possible I do recommend this film as it was a mostly serious and honest story of Tarzan and made a point of showing the gross animal cruelty that was rampant in the 19th century scientific world as well as the pure and simple beautifully primitive life Tarzan lived as a young man who was found as a baby and raised by chimps after the violent death of his parents in the African jungle Christopher Lambert was wonderful and very soulful in his life of Tarzan role as was Ralph Richardson in his last film role as Tarzans ultrarich nobilityreeking gramps in Scotland Andy MacDowell was pretty and pretty good as Tarzans gussiedup and civilized Jane in her first movie role From his charismatic work in this film and his very haunting eyes I cannot understand why Lambert did not later become a big star but his really bad movie choices later may have done him in The terrific Ian Holm as a wounded Frenchman in Africa helped by Tarzan and who then escorted Tarzan back to his previously unknown ancestral home in Scotland was great as always I am so glad Tarzan got sick of and didnt stay in the animalcruel civilized world at that time and went home to Africa in the end to live out his life with his gentle and loving ape relatives who raised him instead of staying in Scotland and living like royalty which would have ruined him if it didnt kill him first
1,If you are looking for King Kong you mispelled your search This is a lowlow budget movie that was soley ment to entertain people in a comic sense Here is the most ordinary human who is the only 1 who can save the world from a 185 300 ton behmouth Surely you can see the humor in that
1,i see there are great reviews of this film already ive got a few points to comment on reasons i thought there was something special about this film first and foremost the film is realistic it may not seem realistic to an adult who has forgotten what it was like being a teenager but thats really the kind of superdrama that goes on amongst teens all the time second the good guy the guy who treats women with respect doesnt get the girls thats the way it is in real life just the same hes too nice for his own good people are just selfish third it was nice to see a fat guy who had some selfconfidence i mean that role already takes confidence from the actor im not just talking about the character overall i thought the film was a positive surprise that secretly hides amongst wacky partyin teen sex comedies at the rental shelf dont get me wrong its not all sad its a good laugh as well
1,I had the chance to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it tremendously I thought it to be one of the most captivating movies that Id seen for a long time One of the best points of the film was to meet new fresh faces and great actors behind them in unexpectedly and brilliantly filmed great locations The three heroes share a chemistry on screen that runs all across the film making it so thrilling They are set on outstanding landscapes spotted by such an original eye the DOPs work is just great that makes you feel like you are discovering them for the first time The mood of the desert floods everywhere and even the scenes filmed in the streets of Los Angeles or San Francisaco seem to be a natural extension of it The story rides you smoothly through all these beautiful settings to lead you to a bittersweet ending being the perfect climax for this perfect journey The construction of the film itself is a master craft The skilled use of innovative resources like stills stitching Dannys memories into the film will compare to those handmade pieces of work so rare and so enjoyable Blind Spot achieves to capture the essence of the desert taking you to an universal common ground where anyone of us can feel being both discoverer and native
1,A gem of a cartoon from the silent erait was rediscovered by CARTOON NETWORK and was broadcast for likely the first time in decades if ever What makes this so enjoyable are the varied cameosDouglas Fairbanks is attacked by giant mosquitos Will Hays pays a visit as boss of Static Studios as well as appearances by Chaplin Keaton and William S Hart The image of chewing gum decimating the shoes of the populace a moneymaking idea for Felixs nearbankrupt shoesalesman boss cannot be describedit must be viewed A terrific cultural gem
1,This is a great horror film for people who dont want all that vomitretching gore and sensationalism This movie has equal amounts of horror suspense humor and even a little light nudity but nothing big Linnea Quigley isnt over the top as she was in Return of the Living Dead where she danced naked on a crypt but she is still essentially the same slutty character Cathy Podewell is a virginal and chaste character before going on to Dallas and we are also introduced to Amelia soon Mimi Kinkadethe sexy and sinister wouldbe dark matron of the house As she and Linnea are possessed and take over the house they reanimate the bodies of their dead friends to scare the limits out of the survivors Ive heard a lot of people compare this movie to The Evil Dead but if anything this movie is a rival to that one the same way Freddie rivaled JasonThis movie series though is far superior to that one 
1,I saw this movie with hopes of a good laugh but when I watched it I didnt stop laughing for weeks they are such bad actors and it made this movie so much funnier to watch  BTW Ryan Dunn didnt eat the toy car he shoved it up his ass The random appearances from the skaters and Vitos parts were great Gimme some grapes Vito No Valo your grapes are at the store I wouldnt recommend any one under 13 to watch it frankly they wouldnt understand half of the jokes in or what they are talking about I love VLB and after watching this movie I couldnt help but go buy it or the Viva La Bam series What is the deal with this stupid comment thing It has to be 10 lines what kind of Bullsh1t is that I should be able to write one as long or in this case as short as I want Im just going to keep typing until it tells me I can actually send it Its just a waste of time I expected to just say what I wanted it wasnt too much but then Im told I have to keep putting more in and then it corrects my spelling so what if I didnt spell something right you get what I mean still This is ridiculously long Those who live by the Sword get shot by those who dont
1,Film follows a bunch of students in the NYC High School of the Performing Arts Theres Coco Irene Cara a black singer who WILL make it to the top despite everything Shes helped by Bruno Lee Curren a white musician Then theres Doris Maureen Teefy who wants to be an actressbut shes shy and scared She becomes friends with Motgomery Paul McCranepurportedly the only gay student in the school and is romanced by Raul Barry Miller Then theres Leroy Gene Anthony Raywho sadly died in 2003 whos homeless and a great dancerbut cant read Then theres various teachers Albert Hague Anne Meara stand out trying to teach the kids The songs are GREAT the title tune and Out Here On My Own were nominated for Best SongFame won the dances are energetic and the young cast shows plenty of ambition and talent BUT this film misses the boat in the drama department Many plot lines are brought up and completely left openended by the end of the movie Why did Coco do a porno Did Doris and Raul remain together afterwords Did either make it How about Montgomerywhat happened to him And did Leroy ever graduateand how There are too many long speeches Raul has two and moments that just lead to nothing Im assuming there were cuts in the scriptI cant believe the movie just left all this open  Still its worth seeing for the acting and again the music Theres basically not one bad song and the dances go full force and at one point stop trafficliterally My favorites are Fame Out Here and I Sing the Body Electric which is a great closing song So I recommend it but can only give it a 7the script really needed to tie up loose endsand it didnt Trivia They wanted to shot this film at the actual School for Performing Arts but couldnt get permission The dean of the school read the script and said there was way too much swearing in the film That is truethere is a LOT of foul language but thats how high school kids talk Avoid the TV version which abysmally overdubs it
1,This is a low budget well acted little gem Alice a small town Massachusetts teenager fed up with her existence takes to the road to escape her mother who flips burgers and her own job as a check out in a super market She sets out for Florida and to stay with her wealthier high school friend who is a freshman at Miami After her car suspiciously breaks down on the thruway and she loses all her money she ends up with a retired couple in an RV who also happen to be traveling to Florida The couple brilliantly played by Judith Ivy and Bill Raymond are overly hospitable and it turns out a prostitute and and her pimp Slowly Alice is lured into truck stop prostitution as the RV meanders down the thruway in the general direction of Florida Through intermittent flashbacks we learn a little more about Alice and her desire to leave tiny Milford We also see the couple in a new light and their life and the choices made by the couple and Alice all seem quite credible An excellent well made film that you will think about when it is over
1,When you think Oliver Stone the movies that come to mind would be his biggest and most controversial ones like Platoon JFK Born On The Fourth Of July or Natural Born Killers Talk Radio usually doesnt Its a pretty small movie actually More than half the movie takes place with Barry Champlain at his radio station talking into his mike But believe me this is one of Oliver Stones greatest movies and should NOT be missed Above all things its a character study Barry Champlain is a rude selfdestructive risktaking talk radio show host who says one too many things and starts to get in trouble with his boss his lovers his fans and even some Nazis He doesnt like his audience and callers and a lot of them dont like him eithor that or do like him but have no idea why But at the end he says on his show I guess were stuck with each other See Talk Radio even if you dont like Oliver Stone movies You might be surprised I sure was My Rating 1010
1,This game requires stealth smart and a steady hand The gameplay is simply the best on top of that though are the interesting extras  bullet holes stay in the walls enemies react to specific points where they have been hit by bullets there are tons of motion captured animations that make the enemies seem very real for instance when looking through a window at a guard he will stand there swatting flies away sneezing or scratching himself the list goes on This is the best licensedmovie conversion ever and it puts you in the shoes of the suavest super spy This game is the best reason for owning an N64
1,GREAT MOVIE Chucky is by far the funniest character in a movie Jennifer Tilly Tiffany makes this movie even better Well before Chucky died Tiffany and him were together But like ten years later Tiffany gets Chucky back as a doll and brings him back to life It was a great movieScary and definetly funny only because Chucky1010
1,This is one of the best films made about the 80 punk scene I saw this a few years back on a bootleg copy and was amazed Very few of todays kids know the true roots of punk and this movie shows some of the 80s punk legends such as The Germs and shows how it was back then Nowadays so much punk has gone mainstream with MTV and radio and its nice to see the true underground rebellious movement of the original scene Darby Crash of The Germs is one of my heros and this film shows why A must see for all punks and anyone curious about the 80s punk scene
1,The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I have ever seen much better and deeper than Luhrmans RomeoJuliet or Spielbergs Titanic Gerdas love impresses me every time her search her battle is exceptional Gerda becomes a strong loving woman throughout the movie Kay is the poisoner of dark forces the temptation This story encourages me to fight like Gerda for the ONLY ONE for the love of my life for Mister Right Patience is one of the keywords of this movie I cry every time when I realize all the suffering of Gerda and Kay And I wish that it ends soon Snowqueen tells although my life I deeply identify with the story and the characters Thanks at least for Hans Christian Anderson and the director
1,When I rented this movie I half expected it to be a low budget plot less Indy film but thought Id give it a try I started watching Part 1 and couldnt pull myself away till it ended 3 hours later It was by far one of my absolute favorite films of all time From the writing to the directing to the performances I was laughing crying and singing all the way through Nan Astleys rite of passage from innocence to adulthood Rachael Stirling is phenomenal in this film I had never heard of her before but now I will forever remember the vulnerability and strength I felt in her performance She Keeley Hawes and Jodhi May are incredible as they guide you through the emotional turmoils that most feel as they deal with an alternate form of sexuality The fact that the film is set in the 1890s not only educates the audience about homosexuality in that time period but makes a statement about our society today You must see this film and probably like myself youll be making a trip to the store to add it to your collection
1,I think that there was too much action in the end Dont you think that too There was romance adventure that just like told me to put 9 to this movie but action place was too long I liked Reeve a bit I didnt understand why did he have to die I thought that one of the girls gonna die too but my lucky No one else who I liked didnt die How about you What did you liked I saw the movie twice actually And after that I bought that too It was worth it Who did you liked best person The book was really really really cool And the actresses and actors too Everything was perfect What was the song name in the end Will someone answer my questions too PLEASE please please
1,Hehehe This was one of the best funny road movies ever I laughed so I fell out of the chair With many Norwegian and foreign celebrities playing themselves Harald Zwart is the producer known for films like Agent Cody banks and of course One Night at McCools It is about Norwegian crazy fans going to the world cup in Soccer in Germany 2006 And all sort of crazy fun that comes with it It was hilarious I couldnt stop laughing I havent had so much fun in ages Rumors say it will come a number two but I do not know It will be hard beating this one  recommended to everyone It is a must see film I was suppose to see it at the cinema but I had work at the times it where shown And been trying to rent it for a month but all the time rented out Got it today on DVD Well worth it
1,Its the 1920s And a man named Walt Disney was on a mission to satisfy the families and children all over the world with one thing entertainment What did he do He made cartoons Whoo And he made a character that is as great as a mouseMickey Mouse Ha ha Oh boy Two films were drawn out by Mr Disney himself Plane Crazy and Steamboat Willie This review will focus on the 1928 feature Steamboat Willie Ever since I learned about this movie as a little boy Ive always wanted to see this movie Well in 1997 I rented an ancient VHS that had lots of old Disney cartoons on them starring the Mouse Mickey Mouse And guess what That short was on there and I loved it Shortly after I took the tape back this was playing on the old Disney Channel note the Old Disney Channel early one Saturday Morning Yes this is a great cartoon this paved the way for more great Disney stuff from 1928 to 2002 10 stars indeed
1,Patricia Arquette plays American doctor Laura Bowman who takes a holiday to Burma in an attempt to heal her spirit after the murders of her husband and young son She is left behind in Rangoon during a military crackdown and leaves the city with an aging man who works as a tour guide But he is no simple tour guide he is a professor who introduces her to the life outside of the tourist traps  the two of them get caught up in the political upheaval and Laura sees with her own eyes how the government betrays and oppresses its own people This movie is one of my favorites because of its themes First its informational describing some of the injustices that are occurring in Burma Secondly its about a womans struggle to find meaning in life after an incredible loss Thirdly its about compassion and sacrifice and people coming together  without even knowing each other  to endure pain and fear Just about every beautiful scene in this movie is important nothing is wasted here Its an earnest and moving film There is also a very emotional score composed by Hans Zimmer which complements scenes nicely A definite recommend especially to people concerned with human rights  and people who want to know What purpose can I serve 
1,The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years The characters are interesting even if a bit predictable The comedic timing written into the script is more than enough to make up for a wellworn underdog plot When youre sure you know the endingSURPRISE Highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular Great movie
1,Easily one of my three or four favorite films Definitely one for the desert island There is nothing brilliant about this film Rather it glows warm and welcoming The audience is invited to a party and like any good party the joy comes in the interaction of the guests and what you learn as you progress from one to the next With apologies to Joyce the films title conjures up a number of ideas that keep audiences away The film is not horrifying It is not depressing It is a beautiful look into a time that has past within which people are growing up and others are winding down Some are frustrated and others are serene And all around ever present throughout the evening are the people and the parts of people that have been laid to rest The words these exquisite actors are given to speak are perfection and set to the music of the Irish brogue are an auditory feast particularly to us flattoned Americans About the lack of brilliance I referred to above I take it back There is no other word to describe the final scene between Anjelica Huston and Donal McCann It speaks quiet volumes about  well everything Some lovely snowy evening rent this film and just let it happen before you No gunfights no car chases no dinosaurs  just film at its most sublime
1,A pity nobody seems to know this little thrillermasterpiece Where bigger budgeted movies fail Terminal Choice delivers lots of thrills shocks and bloody violence A little seen gem that deserves being searched for in your local video shop That anonymous guy beneath is quite right when he says youll never trust hospitals again it IS that effective  Good endingtoo not really a twist but it doesnt end the way one thought it would Yep thats Ellen Barkin in an early role
1,With the obvious exception of Fools  Horses this was in my opinion David Jasons finest series Coming straight after his TV debut on Do Not Adjust Your Set these 13 episodes revealed a mastery of comic timing not seen since the old silent movie days By comparison Porridge Open All Hours and that awful series Lucky Man did not come close I believe Jason banned the series being repeated because it showed him at his rawest Shame on him A new generation deserves to enjoy this The series actually flopped in the ratings but that is most likely because it was shown against The Brothers which aired on BBC at the same time before VCRs were commonplace BTW I have only just noticed that his long suffering assistant Spencer was played by Mark Eden  Alan Bradley off Coronation Street I am amazed he didnt try to murder Edgar Briggs
1,I am an Australian currently living in Japan I saw this movie on TV here and was very impressed by the accuracy and honesty in the portrayal of Western and Japanese ideologies colliding Whoever wrote the screenplay and directed this film must have a good knowledge of what its like to be a foreigner living in Japan The only part I thought was too Hollywoody was when Tom Sellecks character kisses the woman in the middle of her office and she lets him Public displays of affection are not really acceptable here Finally a movie that highlights the true gaijin experience 910
1,Why this film was only released in 4 states is beyond me I thought this film was a divine story The name says it all Seeing Other People This movie has more logic than laughs which I suppose is why it works so well Common sense also makes an appearance in what would seem to be another puerile sex comedy Alice is getting her feet frozen in the cold when she feels irrationally about the way she might perform for her fiancé not just sexually but as a partner and friend etc This starts what seems to be an almost archetypal journey for the both of them One fling after another leads to trouble as if it wasnt a bad idea from the start Witty dialogue and comic setups make this one funny as hell Nicholson and Mohr set the tone of the film early on and keep the promise they anticipate Other highlights are Lauren Graham Andy Richter and Helen Slaterin her first theatrical film in 10 years Climax begins to take an insane turn but a simple ending makes this one far more enjoyable than most movies today Mohr fans will see something different in his Ed character and fans of Helen Slater will enjoy her shiny moments of a quick but excellent comeback Any Richter takes home the award for most moralistic character Romantic and funny or just plain fun Seeing Other People is a gem which needs to be noticed
1,I went in to this thinking another gross movie with gross humor Telling from my first sentence I dont like that humor and this movie had its moments but I loved it Justin Long has really never done comedy like this where hes sarcastic and clever and I loved it Lewis Blackenough said The ending I really did love because It had to take itself seriously I mean how else would you end it Yes its another underdog story but not in your typical format and the movie wasnt their ups and downs it was people coming together for one common goal To go to college where they were accepted The cast was amazing and yes I did laugh at loud when I didnt think I would and the laughter lasted longer then I thought to The parents and sister played their roles well but their characters are put in when necessary The movie was not focused around them but at the same time they showed up when you expect and not expect them to They played in to the story very well and I loved the familiar faces Anthony HealdBoston Public Jeremy Howard I Galaxy Quest with Justin Long Ross Patterson The New Guyand Sam Horrigan Brink Blake Lively added her certain something to the movie which made it even more enjoyable as well as Bs Friends I recommend this movie to whoever hated those gross comedies of the last 4 years and really want something with humor and an actually story line
1,I think that the movie was really good Subject acting and Nusrat Fateh ALi Khans music were marvellous Although the director has succeeded in showing the status of women in rural areas and how they suffer at the hands of maledominated culture he has neglected Phoolans character a bit and has focussed more on the violence faced by her
1,A rather charming depiction of European union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn to live together in an apartment in Barcelona where they are all studying on international fellowships Central to the story is Xavier  Romain Duriswho may have lived a rather conventional life with his mother in France but who quickly becomes a leader in the group helping them deal with landlords and other problems He learns about life and love rapidly Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance The rest of the cast also play well Occasionally they all lapse into English when they want to make sure they are communicatinguncertain about all their apartment mates ability to understand French or Danish or whatever the languages may be Cinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers
1,Is there any question that Jeffrey Combs is one of the true horror greats This movie seriously doesnt suck and is sort of funny Watching a young Combs at work is great but I wish he had had more lines Look out for Beyond ReAnimator Its going to kick some azz
1,Having not read the book I was more open to the fresh interpretation that each director gives to their medium which is film not to the letter reproductions of literatureon this particular film I was happy that the holocaust that occurred in Russia and its neighboring countries finally received some attention The Nazis were particularly cruel to Russians and Russian Jews If you read the histories and see the monuments built in Smolensk and nearby regions you will understand this movie and why many kept silent when they shouldve spoken up It was certainly time for this to be chronicled and I hope that more stories will come out of this Its high time
1,I saw this film some years ago and promptly bought the soundtrack because it was simply excellent Bacharachs music is endearing and should be given the recognition it richly deserves The cinematography is awesome Critics hated it but they hated HOME ALONE too I havent found it on video but welcome anyone who can find a copy
1,Much better than it is generally given credit for this version of Lost Horizon not only had great music and beautiful scenery but also some stunning mountain photography A special edition laser disc was released some years ago which added more than 30 minutes of previously deleted material extra music and lots of bonus material So why isnt this on DVD Hard to figure the studios out sometimes Certainly the roles could have been given to people who could sing better than Peter Finch Liv Ullman George Kennedy and Sally Kellerman but what do you want in a movie good acting or melodious pipes Song and dance man Bobby Van is great fun Michael York is a suitably tragic villain and seeing Sir John Gielgud decked out as Chang may sound silly but actually works very well on screen Trust me you need to check this movie out  if you can find it
1,I didnt know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the directors later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent DONT TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end And after all was said and done it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience One major caveat I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here
1,I watch many movies but presently my genre number one is Asian horror I have just bought this DVD and I initially found Janghwa Hongryeon an intriguing but confused film since I had not understood many parts of the story But I saw in IMDb Board a message titled Explanation of a Masterpiece all your questions answered Faster load written by opiemar and I was really impressed with the high quality of the explanations this user provided to viewers like me that missed points of the story I would like to congratulate opiemar for his excellent work and suggest him to write a correct summary of this movie in IMDb to help and guide other viewers In the end I agree that Janghwa Hongryeon is a great Korean film but I do not give ten in my vote because very few people can afford to see the same movie more than once like this film demands and without the great support of opiemar I would not be able to understand the story as a whole I intend to see this movie again in a near future My vote is eight Title Brazil Medo Fear
1,This show is my guilty pleasure all the way When I first tuned in to Americas Next Top Model I expected to be bored and to find it very very stupid I didnt This show is actually serious fun I read on one of the other reviews that it makes you wonder if you have what it takes to be Americas Next top model And it so does Who doesnt love the glamour and excitement that come with being a model On ANTM you get to see what its REALLY like And who doesnt love hearing the girls bitch about each other and get into fights Or enjoy wanting to throw something at that Janice lady Give this a chance Dont expect something intelligent or a show you can look to for a life lesson Just enjoy it for what it is Serious fun
1,I thought this movie was great if you didnt take it too seriously Just sit back and enjoy Hilary Swank in all her greatness and laugh when the monks go to Boston MA I also think this movie has a great message about self control and inner strength Plus Mr Myagi was so sweet I wish hed teach me karate
1,Comic secret agents have made a comeback in recent years with Mike Myers Austin Powers and Rowan Atkinsons Johnny English and more recently Steve Carell in the bigscreen version of the hit 60s show Get Smart Back in 1974 it was David Jason who was wearing a shoulder holster and carrying an attaché case full of documents marked Classified The Top Secret Life Of Edgar Briggs was his first starring role in a sitcom after years of being a supporting actor in such shows as Six Dates With Barker the Doctor series and Hark At Barker Humphrey Barclay had found him working in a pier theatre in Bournemouth and was sufficiently impressed to include him alongside Michael Palin Terry Jones and Eric Idle in the childrens comedy show Do Not Adjust Your Set TTSLOEB cast Jason as Edgar Briggs a wellmeaning but incompetent agent for the Secret Intelligence Service Whereas John Steed wore a bowler hat Briggs had a trilby Whereas Napoleon Solo carried a radio pen Briggs owned a pipe Objects fell to bits in his hands He read Confidential documents in bed while his wife  Barbara Angell  perused Womans Own  on one occasion it would be the other way round  When he tracked a pair of Russian agents to a heliport he accidentally switched on the airports Tannoy system and broadcast his plans to capture them When he hid on a train so as to photograph a meeting between an SIS man and his enemycontact it moved off with him aboard and took him straight to Brighton When he tried to organise the defection of a female Russian scientist he took a short cut to elude his pursuers only to wind up hopelessly lost in a car park Yet like Inspector Clouseau he always seemed to come out on top at the end much to the dismay of his colleagues As previously mentioned he was married His wife Jennifer was understanding about the sort of work he did Though they had a row once which resulted in her yelling at him from the window of their highrise flat Secret Service this Secret Service that You never stop thinking about the Secret Service He shouted back Think of the neighbours Theyre not supposed to know Im in the Secret Service Briggs was part of a team of agents whose number included Coronation Street villain Mark Eden  he was the psychotic Alan Bradley  as Spencer Michael Stainton as Buxton and Doctor At Seas Elisabeth Counsell as the lovely Cathy Strong They answered to The Commander played by the late Noel Coleman The Commander was kidnapped in one episode leaving Briggs temporarily in charge of the SIS  which naturally horrified everyone This hilarious show was by Richard Laing and Bernard McKenna who had written for the Doctor series Rather than spoof Bond it was more of a sendup of the serious spy shows such as Callan  though it had a Bondstyle theme tune  Furtive meetings in underground car parks codebreaking stolen missile plans that kind of thing Jason brought a lot of energy to the role doing a lot of his own stunts such as Briggs falling off a ladder whilst decorating his flat and tumbling down a hill in a wastepaper bin and were reminiscent of those to be found in the Pink Panther films Briggs had all the ingredients to be a smashhit Unfortunately it was not networked In the London area it was put out on Sundays at 725 PM where it was trounced in the ratings by the BBCs soapy drama The Brothers It was then moved to Fridays at 7 PM because ITV wanted to showcase its latest American import  the TV version of Planet Of The Apes Briggs never found an audience A similar fate befell Jasons next major show 1976s Lucky Feller It was not until 1977 and A Sharp Intake Of Breath that he found his first successful solo vehicle You can see the title sequence  along with two brief excerpts in German  for this series on YouTube Unfortunately that is all you can see Jason will not permit his early starring shows either to be repeated or released on DVD A great shame For the moment however Edgar Briggs life will have to remain top secret CODA I have seen a number of episodes recently and Im pleased to say it stands up incredibly well
1,As if reality shows like American Idol werent enough in which judges like Simon Cowell shoot razorsharp barbs to contestants trying to make their mark on the music world  barbs that many a time has reduced even outstanding singers to tears after what was deemed a bad performance now Americas Next Top Model has for the past three years invaded the boob tube with its own version of looking for the next big thing in a business that values superficiality concepts of beauty and body dysmorphia A concept created by Tyra Banks who is also a judge in the show it gathers some fifteen contestants from all walks of life and has them submit themselves to innumerable tasks in which they must prove their talent in front of the camera and subject themselves not only to the now departed Janice Dickinson selfdubbed Americans First Supermodel but the equally catty Jay Manuel and Nore Marin who may at one point focus on one girl not performing well and blithely rip her to shreds like it was bad morning coffee Like in many other realitybased shows each week one contestant is voted off and must pack her bags and immediately leave a thing that they are reminded by Tyra at every turn Of course there is the bitchy tension between several of the more typeA females female bonding tears dramatic swells of music in key moments and some truly breathtaking pictures that transform erstwhile ordinary pretty girls into unattainable goddesses Ill have to admit the show is a guilty pleasure Maybe its the state of mind Im in but I kept wondering where the vomitorium was in cases when the already thin girls would need to hurl to make the cut and look the way the judges and photographers and many fickle designers would feel was correct for the moment Even so its drawn me in despite my previous paragraph possibly because Ive always had an interest in the fashion world and have always loved watching stunning women being made even more unworldly with make up and perfect lighting But I wonder where are they going with these increasingly difficult photo shoots Its as if they were competing with Fear Factor Shoots that look like reenactments of fight scenes in CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON shoots where the models have to pose underwater or in almost impossible situations Whats next posing while tied to train tracks as an oncoming Amtrak roars upon them at 70 miles an hour Or a shoot where they are underwater chained trying to set themselves free in record time while at the same time looking smashing in chiffon and never ever forgetting to smile their pearly whites at that camera How about a Pit and the Pendulum version of a photo shoot In one thing the show has to be given some kudos and its in a way akin to American Idol With this Im probably going to justify the harshness of both shows and its abrasive judges  and essentially go against my initial paragraph Americas Next Top Model is a show that is an extended audition like American Idol and in it the girls will get the sort of test treatment they will receive in the real world where prospective designers and photographers as monstrously fickle as they can be will crush them to bits at the drop of a hat if they cant sell themselves the way theyre expected to and where one is asked to leave another will supplant her with the necessary requirements Which makes it a wonder that any girl would want to get into such a difficult media but thats what dreams are made of Going into its Fifth season its been a major disappointment with the departure of Janice Dickinson during her run she was a pretty tough barometer as to how the girls should walk talk emote express themselves and ultimately present themselves as a walking living product that sells With the cold addition of Twiggy I wonder where it will go from here  Twiggy just cant replace the overthetop temperament of Dickinson So with Janices absence the show has lost some of its edge and may even have signaled its slow demise but in the meantime its still a catchy pleasure to watch mindless entertainment on weeknights if at all for the gorgeous visuals If at all its the show that launched Adrienne Curry into the spotlight Curry has made a name for herself due to facts that have less to do with modeling as much as her theatric loveaffair with one time child actor Christopher Knight in their very own reality soap opera
1,Jack Webb is riveting as a Marine Corp drill instructor in the DI Webb play SgtJim Moore a tough but fair Marine whose job it is to prepare young teens for possible combat No one could have played this role any better that Jack Webb As a former MarineI can assure that this is the most accurate film dealing with basic training in the Corp Extremely entertaining
1,What can you say about a short little film filled with secondary actors and no stars with absolutely no bad performances not one poorly delivered line of dialog and with the cold violence on one hand being balanced by the warm heart of the protagonists in the story  Its a jewel a diamond a little valuable gem of a western that evokes the spirit and legend of the American West A West not settled by grand heroes like Hickock or Cody or Masterson or Earp but by the spread of the everyday man and woman farmers and ranch hands merchants and miners and lumbermen whores and barkeeps and entertainers of the day some looking for riches some for peace and quiet some for religious freedom  It is perhaps a very spiritual story though not promoting any particular religion for even the nonMormon cowboys portrayed by Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr act in kind and noble ways toward everybody in the story regardless of religious affiliation and beliefs and go out of their way to promote tolerance and charity when the wagon train comes upon the stranded medicine show people And in true biblical fashion like David and Goliath or Samson and the Philistines they are the guardian angels sent to the wagon train who eventually have to go head to head with the evil incarnate Clegg clan likening them to the serpent in the Garden of Eden and regretting what it is they have to do afterward Its a sweet folkloric tale of the West that hits every target John Ford takes aim at Nowadays I have a western Santa Claus whose red outfit is covered with a denim drover coat whose red stocking cap is replaced by a brown Stetson who carries a burlap bag of presents and a coil of rope To my Santa I added a Winchester rifle with a sling to put on one of his shoulders and a Colt revolver to tuck into his waistband When people at the office ask why my Santa has to carry guns I simply reply Snakes After all isnt the spirit of the Christmas season one where everybody should get what they deserve  Fifty five years later especially post911 the philosophies and attributes demonstrated by the characters and story of this movie are still as relevant today as they were back then
1,This is a film about passion The passion it depicts is largely misdirected even for the leading man But therein lies the incredible power of this film it shows us that what we believe can be contaminated by nonsense and can even lead us to do things that are destructive  to ourselves or others Moreover those who try to escape from acquiring passion watch the druggie who visits the studio also risk selfdestruction The world needs to hear the message of this movie more often
1,A powerful debut film from Murali K Thalluri that explores events in the life of a group of high school students each of them in crisis in one way or another The film starts with the discovery of the body of one of the students then traces the lives of the group over the previous hours leaving the audience in suspense until the last minutes as to the identity of the deceased Each of the main characters is facing major stressors which we could see as potentially precipitating a suicide The cast of unknowns provide performances full of power and emotion Fantastically well done especially considering the youth of the writerdirector who was 19 years old when he wrote the script
1,Bloody marvelous Recommended by a friend who knew I liked Thomas Kretschmann in The Pianist and Downfall I loved the flow of the narrative  how the characters moved from hope and ideals of valour through shock fear disintegration desperation and utter annihilation A first rate antiwar movie that must have created quite the stir in Germany Not a proud moment for anyone and the study of a generation lost This movie was excellent at conveying the remove of the command from the ground troops and in pounding the utter futility of trying to control untamed nature and the Russian psyche If I didnt know I would have thought it was a Russian movie it was so fatalistic What an uncompromising ending A pieta
1,Hilarious film about divine retribution Camera work stinks shot on digital video and looks like early MTV videos Turn the other cheek by looking past the visual and concentrate on the story Laughs galore for those with a welldeveloped sense of irony
1,I was fortunate to attend the London premier of this film While I am not at all a fan of British drama I did find myself deeply moved by the characters and the BAD CHOICES they made I was in tears by the end of the film Every scene was mesmerizing The attention to detail and the excellent acting was quite impressive I would have to agree with some of the other comments here which question why all these women were throwing themselves at such a despicable character SPOLIER ALERT I was also hoping that Dylan would have been killed by William when he had the chance END SPOILER Keira Knightley did a great job and radiate beauty and innocence from the screen but it was Sienna Millers performance that was truly Oscar worthy I am sure this production will be nominated for other awards
1,The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost seamlessly picks up where The Egg and I left off For the first solo adventure of the Kettles a new writing team and director is introduced Leonard Goldstein associate producer of The Egg and I was producer of The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle With many of the characters played by the same actors and actresses the focus from the MacDonalds to the Kettles works very well There is a reference to Ma beating Birdie Hicks for first prize at the fair for her quilt an import scene in The Egg and I The prize money from the quilt contest was to be used to send Tom Kettle to college In this movie Tom is returning home as a college graduate There are two plots intertwined in this movie One is the comedy of the simple mountain family moving into a state of the art modern house The other is a light morality play on how environment affects children as they grow up Pa Kettle Percy Kilbride wanted a free tobacco pouch for entering a contest and ended up winning a house His disappointment at not getting the free tobacco pouch is played for laughs quite a bit When Pa plays with dynamite he is totally oblivious to the explosion Kilbride never flinched in the scene as the debris from the explosion fell around him He played the part to perfection In his autobiography Jack Benny mentioned how impressed he was with Percy Kilbrides deadpan delivery Kilbride took that comedic device to a high level of perfection Ma Marjorie Main and Pa move into the new house with modern conveniences that confuse Ma and Pa almost as much as they help them Ma adapts far more quickly than Pa Included with the modern conveniences is a television a very new household item in 1949 Moving walls hidden beds and plumbing fixtures are used as comic props but the attention is on Ma and Pa never the props themselves Tom Kettle Richard Long meets Kim Parker Meg Randall a magazine writer who feels that hygiene and environment are essential for children to realize success as adults Tom is a bright selfmade man who contradicts the theory that success can only come from a pristine environment This subject is briefly discussed in a couple of scenes but left to subside It was also the only serious discussion in this otherwise whimsical movie Seeing the Kettles moving out of their rundown old house to move to a new house would almost be a disaster if it were not for the characters staying true to themselves Ma was the practical one just as she had been in the The Egg and I Pa was the fish out of water that provided the best comedy He never felt at home in the new house but the actual location of a comfortable bed would never be of concern to him
1,So often these Lifetime flicks are onedimension with overthetop characterizations and performances and with contrived plot lines and climaxes which are intended to trade any semblance of reality for drama But most of all many of these flicks provide characters where its difficult to feel a trace of sympathy or empathy for even the good guygood gal characters much less thebad ones However here the performance were all good the characters realistic and the relationships among the three leads as well as the exhusbandfather and the two females rang true throughout The mothers boyfriend was portrayed as being about halfway in age between mother and daughter and the actors were ageappropriate to this in term of their actual ages None of the characters was portrayed at an extreme  either allgood or allbad  and all rang true Without in any way condoning his allowing the relationship with his prospective stepdaughter to advance to the level which it did  you can still feel some sympathy for him without retracting blame Neither mother nor daughter were perfect neither good nor bad but simply two individuals whose relationship seemed realistic and not contrived by the script writer Lifetime flicks  even those which begin with some semblance of normality  often end with a deranged character brandishing a carving knife or such Other stories seem to need to provide the everyone lived happily everafter close This film presented a realistic premise story and resolution from start to finish  a welcomed variation to the norm of this genre
1,The DVD release of this superior made for TV BBC drama is a more than welcome addition to my collection Great acting gripping story and wonderful direction all add up to one of the best BBC dramas in years
1,Have to agree that this movie and its talented director do not receive the plaudits they deserve Heres hoping that the DVD will do very well and bring both to the attention of a wider audience The actors gave excellent performances and the plot is excellent Perhaps overall the movie is a little long but May Miles Thomas seems to enjoy her actors when they are giving strong performances and therefore sometimes holds them in longer close ups than necessary Good for the actors I am sure but sometimes as the audience you are ready to move on so to speak with the plot May Miles Thomas deserves more recognition from the Film business as one of our foremost digital movie directors
1,This movie has a lot to recommend it The paintings the music and David Hewletts naked butt are all gorgeous The plot a story of redemption forgiveness and courage in the face of adversity is also very interesting and touching  and its not predictable which is saying quite a lot about a movie in this day and age But the acting is mediocre the direction is confusing and the script is just odd It often felt like it was trying to be a parody but I never figured out what it was trying to be parody of And if its not a parody well it remains a movie with great potential that it didnt live up to
1,I just saw The Big Trail in Viennas Filmmuseum for the first time Immediately I was astonished by both the pictures optical high quality and unusual format and by its beautifully detailed story Who has ever seen such a documentary style western with John Wayne And there is so much time you can actually look around on the screen there is so much to see One is ever grateful that the scenes are often static because every single shot is so well composed and you want to take it it Even the acting is good and fits in well The long running time of the picture is wonderful you dont want to miss a minute of it
1,This is a remake of the anime classic from the 80s and this one is even better Sylia Nene Linna and Priss are all back as the Knight Sabers in their hardsuits battling the robotic boomers The animation is crisp the characters are welldeveloped and the action rocks Priss is a singer in her regular job so the series features some wonderful songs as well There is a fair amount of violence but most of it is against robots and there is some fan service but nothing too racy The DVDs also have many extras including commentaries which really enhance your understanding and enjoyment of the show A musthave for any anime fan Also recommended Burst Angel Armitage III
1,And I do Peter Falk has created a role that will live on forever in TV land And Im grateful for that This isnt one of his finest hours though Columbo goes to college and basically teaches how he solves a crime and yet there are bad guys who go ahead and think theyre smarter than he is What all us fans know is that Columbo needs a worthy opponent Without a great enemy how can he be the hero in the wrinkled coat Still its better than NO Columbo and Ill wait and watch the next one as well
1,Not since J Michael Straczynskis Babylon 5 has a television show captured the wonderful art of applying a story arc to a television show This is easily the best thing on TV right now The characters are likable and one can easily get attached to them and care for their wellbeing The villians are the type you love to hate and leave you wondering what theyre up to next And Brian Hensens puppet work is the most innovative out there Kudos to Rockne S OBannon for a job well done
1,I knew as soon as I saw the first trailer for Black Snake Moan that I would have to see it I was not disappointed in the slightest in the film which was written and directed by Hustle and Flows creator Craig Brewer It tells the story of a broken blues man and the nymphomaniac he aims to cure not just for her sake but also his ownyet its so much more than that Its complex and rich and it manages to steep you in a gritty sticky sultry blue Memphis without making you feel like you need a bath afterward The characters are for the most part multifaceted and very wellwritten and performed The accents and the dialogue were carried off flawlessly However there was one weak link in the chain Justin Timberlake The best I can say for him is that he can pull off cryingits a rare male actor who can cry convincingly However Justins Ronnie was flat but as an actor he was trying very hard I would definitely give him another chance Lazarus and Rae Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci respectively have a great chemistry and a great respect for each other This is one of those films where it doesnt matter how good one actor is if the other one isnt up to the task and luckily both of the actors were up to the task The music was very bit as good as you would expect especially when Mr Samuel L Jackson sings the blues Phenomenal On the technical side all was brilliance as far as I could see It was welledited well shot and wellmixedeverything was great The character and set designs were just right the casting of the supporting characters even Justin Timberlake and especially Kim Richards was spot on Loved it
1,This movie includes one of the best characters and dialog that Crispin Glover has ever played Uma Thurman and Suzy Amis are also great in this movie but Crispin makes it a great depiction of young people trying to make it in New York
1,The Cure is a fantastic film about a boy with AIDS Ive cried about 4 times watching this film and its just so sad I cant promise everyone will cry watching this but it will make you want to Very emotional and very sad The Cure is a mustsee movie It shows you the meaning of friendship and love and is an extremely great movie At first I didnt think it would be as great and wondered why my mum always cried watching it But now I know its a stunning film that is so original and is so close to real life situations unlike most of the other films that doesnt make sense Words cannot describe the greatness of The Cure you just have to see it
1,This is precious Everything Is Illuminated is sweetly and sublimely funny from the first delicious line of dialogue Oh how Ive been waiting for this to arrive in Austin While Elijah Wood is charming as ever as Jonathan Safran Foer the reallife author of the novel Everything Is Illuminated its Eugene Hutz playing Jonathans Ukrainian tourguide and translator Alex who truly steals this film Alex is a hiphoplovin Ukrainian breakdancer who along with his grandfather helps Jonathan find the woman who saved Jonathans grandfathers life during World War II The Ukrainian countryside has never looked so breath taking Im thinking of packing it all up and moving to the former Soviet state The tone of the film however shifts when Jonathan and Alex do finally meet the woman theyre looking for and suddenly this adorable comedy turns into a heartbreaking historical drama about a Jewish village that was annihilated during the Nazi occupation Everything Is Illuminated is about history heritage and the wisdom that can be gained from uncovering the past Its perfect
1,Dont listen to most of these people ill give you a better review of this movie which me and my friend love Its about Jill Johnson played by Camilla Belle who babysits at the Mendrakis house and someone breaks in if youre wondering how he got in the house he went through the garage most likely so anyway dont listen to the worst acting it has amazing acting with a great story I think that there are 2 benefits that Jill has 1 shes a fast runner and is on the track team 2she got out alive lol it is a cool movie and quite scary check it out you will be happy with this masterpiece dont listen to the other people on the site its very good trust me i am good at reviewing movies Im a future movie critic i totally want to buy this movie and you will too when you see it it is amazingly awesome
1,I seen this movie when it came out I thought what an average movie I have now realized that this director was ahead of his time This is a great movie and great soundtrack I have seen my share of rock films but although this is far from spinal tap which I did not like This film does take us into the life of an 80s rocker wanting to be nothing but This is nothing more than our inner child wanting to grow up and to be a ROCK STAR Yeah I said it Everyone wants to grow up and be on the spot light Weather said or not This movie just puts you in the core of emotions and you can almost feel the excitement of Izzy I must admit the acting was less par but still the music and story was enough to hold you in to it till the credits rolled Worth the watch especially if you are a fan of ye Ole mighty hair bands
1,A widely unknown strange little western with mindblowing colours probably the same material as it was used in Johnny Guitar I guess Trucolor or something which makes blood drips look like shining rubies nearly surrealistic scenes with twisted action and characters Something different far from being a masterpiece but there should be paid more attention to this little gem in western encyclopedias
1,This movie reminded me of the live dramas of the 1950s not like the recent Failsafe which seemed more of a stunt than anything else but a TRUE moral drama that is both engaging and thoughtprovoking Anne Heche is more than credible as the army officer having an affair with her superior played by Sam Shepard and Eric Stoltz is wonderful as her lawyer defending her against the military establishment I found myself waiting for THEIR affair to begin if only because they look so good together This movie is apparently based on a true story and its a relief to be asked to think about real issues for a change  Directed by Christopher Menaul who also did The Passion of Ayn Rand with Stolz and the Prime Suspect series this is a movie with panache and style and is absolutely worth seeing
1,Nuovomondo 2006 shown in the US as The Golden Door was written and directed by Emanuele Crialese This film is differentand I think betterthan most movies about impoverished people who leave Europe and come to the United States The film begins with scenes in a poor rural region of Sicily We always hear that Sicily is a rocky island but you wont really understand the implications of that phrase until you see the first halfhour of The Golden Door  The middle section of the film is devoted to the long voyage to the US Most immigration films show us ten minutes of people in the thirdclass section becoming seasick and then show us the Statue of Liberty Not this moviewe get a sense for life below decks and it isnt charming We never actually see the Statue of Liberty either  Finally the typical movie will give us another ten minutes of Ellis Island and then the immigrants are walking through New Yorks Lower East Side Not herethe Ellis Island experience occupies about onethird of the footage  Vincenzo Amato is outstanding as Salvatore Mancuso who is bringing his two sons and his mother to the new world Charlotte Gainsbourg is equally good as Lucy Reed a mysterious Englishwoman who also speaks fluent Italian There are some strange touches in the movie especially the sound track with songs by Nina Simone There must be some symbolism there but I couldnt make sense of it Another reviewer has already pointed out that this film will do better viewed in a theater rather than on DVD Still large screen or small screen its worth seeking out
1,A great production that should be revivedrebroadcast I doubt that it would be out of date Id love to hear from anyone who knows whether videos exist of this series or any other information about where it could be found or viewed
1,One of the best western movies ever made Unfortunately it never got the recognition it deserved The storyline the action and the music was in my mind one of the best I give it a double A Randolph Scott gave a terrific performance along with the other members of the cast The ending was one of the best of any western made
1,I had seen this movie before but I could not remember it was this fantastic it has a fun plot Madonna fumbles around the city with pumas etc causing a commotion And the music is just perfect And the happy ending Who´s that girl is a great choice for a romanticist like me In my opinion this could be even the best Madonna movie I have ever seen 1010
1,This Oscarwinning short film 40 minutes based on a short story by William Faulkner takes us back to smalltown Tennessee in December 1941 Two brothers one about 18 and one about 8 are looking for birds eggs obviously a huge collectors item for boys in the South around this time Well the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor and the older brother Pete decides to enlist He gives his prize egg to his little brother Willie and heads off wishing to show more emotion and tenderness to his little acolyte Well Willie isnt having any of it if Pete can be a soldier so can he He heads to Memphis showing his stubbornness and determination as he gets the better of several adults along the way After finding the enlistment center in Memphis he demands to see his brother pulling a knife on a lieutenant and wounding him in the process We are shown the devotion and love of a little brother Jonathan Furr He delivers a impeccable performance as a stubborn strongwilled boy in the gentler times of yesteryear The movie tries and mostly succeeds in showing how brothers can show devotion and the importance of family ties in ones youth As the two brothers reunite shortly the movie delivers a cathartic cry as the brotherly love envelops us all This movie is like a cold bottle of water Maybe Dasani or Aquafina good clear water with a flavorful mineral packet but not pure natural spring water like Evian Still it quenches your thirst and you dont doubt its purity and quenching effects It is more run of the mill and less expensive than some but gets the job done leaving one refreshed and detoxified afterwards 710
1,Felix is watching an actor rehearse his lines A ham A ham My kingdom for a ham sandwich The dramatic guy that tells Felix hell have to sacrifice my art and go into the movies Hes in tears Felix just looks at him like hes nuts and shrugs his shoulders The old guy tells Felix to go ye forth and find money to finance a trip to Hollywood Felix thinks How does he expect me to get the money In minutes of course this is a cartoon he spots a shoe business owner putting up a bankrupt sale on his store Felix comes up with a plan to bail him out and the man promises the cat 500 if it works Well it does but the man wants to go alone and leave Felix at home In an outrageous scene Felix transforms himself into a briefcase and thats how he gets to Hollywood transforming himself back to cat when they get there We then witness Felixs attempts at getting into show business His audition scenes are very funny especially with his imitation of Charlie Chaplin In addition there are caricatures of some famous silent film stars and executives In all quite a bit of material is in this 95 minute cartoon Its amazing how much more you can get in an extra 25 minutes assuming most animated shorts are seven minutes in length At any rate there were a number of laughs in here and more zany things you could only see in a cartoon like Felix have a sword duel with giant mosquitoes Crazy stuff
1,You got to see it to believe it Shot in Hollywood on the strip in the middle of the sleazy anything goes 70s this cheaply made flick must of really packed the inner city theatres back in the day Then again I bet it had a one week run Actually its pretty hilarious The acting is dreadful the direction non existent but the hair clothes rotten pre disco music and the general out and out sleaziness of the story are mind boggling Sleazy its very sleazy Highly recomended if you can find it
1,My original title for this review was going to be Ending disappoints Film triumphs But I actually thought about this one on the way home It is not the fairy tale most of these films are it takes turns that are different and while its ending is at first disappointing it slowly sinks in and hits the core on a satisfying tone The plot follows a man named James AaronCurb Your Enthusiasms Jeff Garlin who also wrote and directed a struggling actor who lives in Chicago with his mother and deals with both his obesity and his inability to find someone to love Yes it sounds corny but it experiments with elements that make it somewhat unpredictable and actually makes you wish it were longer The ending came kind of abruptly and had me saying thats it But once it starts to take its toll it really makes you smile It does have many tones of seriousness throughout but fear not for it is also very funny Some scenes offer huge laughs and those who have seen Jeff Garlins standup will recognize a couple Primarily when he gives a speech at career day for his nieces kindergarten class and bombs It begins on somewhat of a serious note that you do not expect but what follows is very funny entertaining and quite poignant as well It is the kind of movie that you keep watching and always enjoy And as I said before while the ending may seem absurd at first once you take time to think about it is a true joy
1,I would like to submit the following goof During the bridge scene soldiers are seen wading out in the river asking to be taken away and seeking to escape Some of the soldiers approach Captain Willards boat and attempt to board carrying with them suitcases Soldiers are not issued nor do they ever carry suitcases into a combat zone They have duffel bags packs and footlockers but not suitcases The use of a suitcase in this scene is absurd and out of keeping Additionally if you look closely you will see that the suitcase is floating on top of the water This is probably a very good indication that it is emptyotherwise it would sink
1,The Frogs Who Wanted a King or Frogland is Ladislaw Starewiczs most cautionary tale about people wanting government to solve their problems that Ive ever seen The ironic thing is that they pray to the god Jupiter for their answers Jupiter responds first by sending a tree stump and then a stork Neither works out and the stork is especially dangerous to the amphibian creatures The frogs have some human qualities when we see them dress in the latest fashions of the day and we see some take pictures or use a movie camera when the stork arrives Like I said this short is very much a political allegory more suitable for adults than children In fact I first saw this on the Rhino VHS that had Bambi Meets Godzilla That alone should tell you what to expect here
1,I really enjoyed this movie I have a real sense of justice and an eye for an eye and this movie delivers that in spades Glenn Ford is offered a very low price for his ranch by the big rancher in the valley then one of his ranch hands is beaten and shot to help him make up his mind about selling When the ranch hand dies and the sheriff refuses to do anything Ford seems at first reluctant to do anything cautioning his men to not take things into their own hands But thats just what he is about to do I knew this movie was about to catch fire when he went into the saloon and faced the guy Richard Jaeckel one of my very favorite badguy character actors who had killed his ranch hand after a gentle exchange of dialog with him Glenn Ford slaps his face and shoots him dead Kind of a neat added bit of justice he kills this guy with the gun that had belonged to his murdered cowhand In short order were treated to Ford letting his ranch be burned so his men are justified in ambushing the crew from the other ranch then Ford and his men stampede all the horses and cattle of the big bad guys ranch then they show up and burn the outbuildings and the big fancy house to the ground Talk about getting even bigtime Lots of action in this movie Theres more to the story than this but Ill just recommend you watch the movie Glenn Ford was someone who showed time and again what can happen when you misjudge someone and I really enjoyed watching him get justice the old fashioned way
1,A twist of fate puts a black man at the head of an oldschool whitebred advertising firm And he intends to make a few changes One very strange piece of cinema Youll either love it or hate it Either way youve never seen anything like it
1,A group of evil businessmen need to knock down a building to build a huge complex but they cant remove the tenants The tenants and businessmen with their hired thugs clash until the film ends with one of the funniest fights ever The guy with the ginger hair who goes eeeeehhhh every time he throws a punch and the other guy who poses with a knife in his mouth instead of fighting only to be beaten off camera make this essential viewing if you like to laugh at films rather than with them
1,At the time of this writing January 25 2006 I am saddened to hear of the passing within the past few hours of Chris Penn Other than Footloose The Wild Life is the film that I remember Chris most from I still remember in the film with slight fondness of Chris wrestling character and teammates sitting in their favourite restaurant with a huge plate of french fries in front of them drowned in an entire bottle of ketchup Anyhow my comment is in regards to the title track sung by Bananarama After these many years I still remember the rumour Canadian spelling  lol that Bananarama was called in at the very VERY LAST moment to compose the track for the film and that they wrote the song on the plane bound to the recording studio to record the song and just after they recorded the song they went to shoot the low cost video for their title track I heard that this entire process from start to finish took 4 hours to do If this is true then they truly are worthy of being the most successful female band of all time Anyhow this is just a rumour I had heard back in the day and still remember a generation later Perhaps anyone who reads this can comment and clarify Thanks
1,There is no need for me to repeat the synopsis rendered by Glenn The black and white rendition is even more powerful in portraying the bleakness of country village life at that time The deep measure of friendship shown by Babette toward the two elderly sisters touches the heart strings The supporting cast is excellent and their performances superb it would not be fair to single out any one character since the entire story depends on the cast as a whole I cannot put my finger exactly on why I rate this movie so highly since I am not a professional critic individual viewers may or may not agree with my rating since enjoyment of this type of movie is always in the eye of the beholder
1,This movie was so cool I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends While the first credits were rolling we saw that Lionsgate Films had made this movie They are the ones that made that stupid movie Wolf Creek which was totally gay When we saw this we groaned We thought it was going to be like Wolf Creek but we were so wrong The movie was not only better than Wolf Creek which really isnt that hard it is one of the best horror movies I have seen in a long time They really redeemed themselves with this movie It was gory smart and scary which are the combinations to an awesome horror movie Kane is awesome as Jacob Goodnight and Christina Vidal Samantha Noble and Luke Pegler did pretty good jobs as part of a group of delinquents cleaning an old motel It had some gross scenes and you actually kinda feel sad for some of the people who die All in all a great horror movie to watch on a Friday or Saturday night with the lights off and with friends Just dont watch it in a hotel
1,A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film Who are the crazy people The answer become less clear as the film goes on Renee Zellweger loses the whiney note in her voice and while her voice is still high she is incredibly effective as the shellshocked Betty In fact she is so effective I almost wanted her to be just a little more crazy because her created reality was so believable This is the first time Ms Zellweger has been called upon to carry a film and she is more than equal to the task Chris Rock  though as foulmouthed as usual  is fairly subdued as Wesley He is able to sublimate his manic energy and it only occasionally surfaces and always when it is needed most There are some interesting allusions the first time you see Betty she is dressed almost exactly like Dorothy Gale from the Wizard of Oz  then later in the film she is compared to Dorothy when she says she has never been out of Kansas before At one point the song that Doris Day was best known for Que Sera Sera is on the soundtrack and then later Charlie Morgan Freeman describes her as having a whole Doris Day thing going on This is an extremely quirky film with good performances by everyone including the supporting cast It has a surprising ending that as contrary as it sounds is actually fairly predictable If for no other reason see this film just to listen to the master of the human voice Morgan Freeman
1,This multileveled thriller kept my attention throughout It is disturbing and informative to see how perverse human behavior can be It is also instructive as to what past wounds can motivate present behavior No one save Sandra Bullocks partner is very likable However all are believable Sandra did an excellent job Her character Cassie comes alive with all her pain and fear and defenses She is a survivor and so her life experience finally brings her to a healing moment I enjoyed this movie very much Tom Landers
1,I saw this last night and voted it an 8 Since then its grown on me and Id give it a 9 The film has at first a seemingly slightly disconnected facade between the first and second halves The first half is a comedy and theres little hint of the ragged truths of eras life wars religious intolerance that will become revealed in the second half While at first it may be a little disconcerting because its a slightly unfamiliar narrative sequence on reflection it works The acting was good Hultz in the role of Alex the interpreter was especially great Ive scanned most other User Comments and see that some whove read the book are pleased with the movie while there are a few who are not Both feelings of course are valid For me a retired family therapist and oneworld believer the film was relevant on two different levels The first as history gave a powerful reminder of how commonly polarizations happen  with demonizing and trying to exterminate any of those with a smidge different moral value system than our own  The second was that in demonstrating the first it also revealed something in common to EACH of us ALL our families  that each of us must go back to our roots to more fully understand ourselves TS Eliot expressed this exquisitely in the 4th of his Four Quartets when he said  We shall not cease from exploration And the end of all our exploring Will be to arrive where we started And know the place for the first time  Jonathan goes on a fulfilling journey that any of us would find fantastically illuminating  to explore and discover our roots what were those people going through then who were they  really  before when and during the early years before and after we were born Etc  So the film at first gives us the impression of a comedy then shifts to give us a lesson in history and human deficiencies but through all that it also gives us  subliminally  a message about each of ourselves All of us would be abundantly rewarded to go back and understand the place from which we first started
1,This film is a great rampage of action and comedy it gets right in to it right from the start theres no boring build up The chemistry of the leading roles adds to the excitement and anticipation of the ending even though my suspicions were not satisfied The special effects worked brilliantly and were believable Would have liked a different ending but it still had me reeling in emotions The story line unfolds well however it is a film you have to watch from start to end carefully to pick up on all the details to fully understand and get maximum enjoyment 
1,It may be a remake of the 1937 film by Capra but it is wrong to consider it only in that way It was supposed to expose Hiltons novel in a completely different way As a musical is excellent The scenery is terrific the characters good and anyone like Leonard Maltin who considers the Bacharach music awful must be completely deaf I strongly recommend it
1,OK Is Barney the best childrens show of all time Of course not But in some of the comments left by other members of IMDb you would think it was a multi million dollar production with high class actors and a ridiculous budget for special effects Well guess what Its Barney for Gods sake He shows children good behavior good manors and that its OK to be who you are For those of you who find him annoying that is because you are not five years old and the show was not meant for you To the IMDb member who wrote the review on the first page I think you may have gone a little too far Did you actually describe a Sesame Street character as down to Earth Grow up everyone this is a great show for preschoolers and actually does help children learn in a fun and creative way
1,This was a bold movie to hit Indian cinemas when it was released The first movie to perhaps openly depict lesbian tendencies amongst Indian women The leading actress of Indian cinema Shabana Azmi added substance to the movie with her hot passionate scenes with Nandita Das The movie oozed with sexuality and the director used sex in the best way possible The sex was not for erotic purposes but was in the context of the movie The scene where Nandita Das loses her virginity to her husband certainly was the first of its kind in Indian cinemas Good acting by all the actors especially Nandita Das amidst criticism from the Indian public
1,this is one of my favorite movies ever along with casablanca and cannibal holocaust this is near perfect cinema rex allen narrates this wonderful tale of a cougar who just needs a little loving contains action adventure suspense comedy and riverbed chaos SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU HAVE TO KILL TO DO IT you will not find a better cat picture anywhere with cat from outer space coming in as a not so close second charlies performance is magnificent even includes animal cruelty and intense logging gotta love disney for all moral failures
1,this movies is really special  its about a young french who go in Barcelona spain in order to study and in barcleona he meets other youngs europeean like him This film hes the EUROPEAN MOVIES of the YEAR so go watch it 
1,Queen of the Damned is one of the best vampire movies I had ever seen The movie had suspense action and gore The combination of the fierce demanding attitude of the Queen and the rock mood of our star very well acted by Stuart Townsend makes a wonderfully done movie that only this combination can create Im always the one to give advice to my friends and family members on which movies are worthy of renting and when they ask me if Queen of the Damned is worthy I tell them its worthy of buying This movie is most for sure a musthave in all horror movie lovers homes
1,Prime Suspect 4 continues the exploits of the inscrutable and dogged seeker of truth and justice Detective Superintendent Jane Tennison the first of three miniseries PS4 PS5  PS6 with the notable absence of founding writer Lynda La Plante from the credits Imbued with the same gritty reality of the first three series the second three series pit Tennison against the forces of evil while coping with middle age loneliness indiscretions a host of personal and professional problems and resolutions which are sometimes less than ideal PS4 conjures two stories while PS5  PS6 are single episodes each which find Tennison seeking justice on behalf of the brutally wronged while waging war against institutions which are willing to sacrifice the interests of her victims for those of a greater good In other words to prevail Tennison must overcome both evil and good forces something which makes the always gray scenarios of the PS series yet grayer and the Tennison wars as much a matter of principle as of finding murderers Very good stuff which only gets better from series to series B

1,This documentary focuses on the happenings in Gothenburg 2001 In swedish media the demonstrators where pictured as criminals that stood for anarchy and violence This movie shows that there not actually they are intelligent articulate people that has something to say  And says it by the force of bricks They believe in a better world a world where people can think and say what they want  without being aimed at But are their beliefs of having the possibility of changing the society realistic I think not This documentary gives us enlightenment in the issues of greed capitalism and the future it might bring It is a great documentary that is not propaganda because it is not shown as what they say is right Everything it shows is what some individuals think and it is up to the viewer to decide if what they do and stand for is right or wrong I have heard many people that labels this a propaganda and therefor chooses not to view it I think they are making a bad decision because even if you sympathize with the police or the demonstrators belief all you get is more facts to rely on for example the kid that got shoot says that he thinks that it is good to throw a brick through a McDonalds window because it is the step between thinking and acting as you think Overall this movie freaked me out because you cannot really dismiss the facts that the few policemen that fought violence with violence did not get convicted or even detained in custody even however the proof of them throwing bricks at the demonstration march and in some cases beating people with truncheon even though they are lying on the street without making resistance where as good as it gets Rating 810  Very good but not best
1,Okay sure this movie is a bit on the hokey side Its difficult to take characters from comic books and put them into movies with any credibility Dolph Lundgren as The Punisher anyone but this tries very hard Ive never read the actual comic book but that doesnt really matter I suppose I judge a film mainly on its merits not on whether it is a faithful retelling of someone elses idea Unless its a film based on a true story that demands at least some attempt at truth and accuracy So why will I give this movie a fairly high rating Because it tries It tries very hard In my book that makes it a fair attempt at an entertaining film Many films have been made with vampire subject matter being the main focus It seems everybody has their take on vampire lore be it the cross the silver the garlic the aversion to sunlight whatever Some of those ideas are included here The storyline is familiar a group of vampires conspire to take over the world with one person mainly standing in their way Blade Wesley Snipes lives for the sole purpose of the destruction of the vampiric masses who have slowly but surely moved into the world and share it with humankind For the most part the human race is blind to the fact that vampires exist all around them The vampires have even taken familiars people who aspire to be vampires and do the vampires dirty work for them to show how worthy they are of eventually being turned Now that I think of it there are many elements of this movie similar to the storyline of the Roddy Piper film They Live A hidden enemy hidden group of people plotting against them the fight to save humankind all that is present in Blade as well The acting isnt the best here Snipes is at best only slightly better than some of his other roles NBushe Wright a relative newcomer isnt too bad Kris Kristofferson is forgettable as Blades sidekick hes to Blade what Chip is to The Punisher Stephen Dorff does the best job of the whole cast here as the head vampire you just love to hate I dont know but I just loved the special effects in this film From the bloodsoaked vampirestyle rave all the way to the inevitable fight at the finale of the film the special effects arent half bad Theres certainly enough blood and gore to go around but after all this is a vampire movie right The various shapes and sorts of weaponry Blade uses are fairly unique and not generally used in contemporary action films Snipes has more flair with a deckedout sword than he does with say a machine gun Plus theres so much more thought that goes into fighting with a blade than just blowing someone away Unless of course you are Indiana Jones Overall this isnt the best action film ever made but its not half bad either As a bonus the musical score  soundtrack are pretty cool too Tell me in what other movies can you hear super drumnbass like Source Direct or Photek My Rating 810
1,One of the major aspects of Malenkaya Vera called Little Vera in English is that it was the first movie from the Soviet Union that featured a sex scene albeit a short one The title is important Vera is the Russian word for faith identifying that punk Vera Natalya Negoda has little faith in the Soviet system And as the movie shows theres not much faith to be had in it The opening scene shows the bleak industrial town of Zhdanov nearly a hell on earth When Veras lover Sergei Andrey Sokolov moves in with her family it leads to some unexpected events Like in many Russian movies peoples names describe their characters For example theres Viktor remember that victor means winner All in all this is a good look at the Soviet Union while it was collapsing  and we can see why it was collapsing Really good
1,I recently purchased this on DVD as I hadnt heard of it and like robert carlyle Obviously this movie is not going to have Hollywood blockbuster special effectsin saying that though the special effects were decent enoughand the acting was fine also I found the movie to be enjoyable and do not regret buying it at allat almost 2 hours long it is just the right length for this type of movie Do not expect thrilling explosive action from beginning to end thoughit is a fairly well balanced movie with a decent enough storyline
1,Lotsa action cheesy love story unexpected actors and overall great fun The special effect are acceptabledecent some of the fighting is kinda neat with some interesting acrobatic moves The overall story moves along and is cheesy enough to keep you wondering when the inevitable is going to happen although there is a bit of a twist just a small one The overall naivety of the movie make it quite whimsical at times Cute enough chicks too what more could you want PS if youre gonna review a movie like this try to review it in terms of the category the movie would fall not necessarily where it was intended to fall ie dont bomb out good cheesy movies
1,I went to the movies to see Claudine and loved every minute of it the cast and the soundtrack as well Diahann Carroll was never better than in this role We saw Ms Carroll downplayed her looks barely saw her nakedsmoked a cigarette drank beer and oh she cursed Whenever this movie was shown on TV and finally cable I would call my friends to watch it Just the soundtrack from the very beginning of the movie is awesome all thanks to Gladys Knight and the Pips We saw a black woman struggling to raise her children dealing with teen pregnancy and everyday life meets a man whom she learns later on has issues himself Finally this movie made it to DVD and well deserving
1,I was surprised to catch this on TV Friday and I enjoyed it Between the presence of Bobbie Phillips and the numerous references to everything that could be considered cyberpunk this was a fun movie to watch I enjoyed the story which reminded me of a book Ive read Earth David Brin and was fun to see on TV Bobbie looks great but I also enjoyed her performance as Kam because she did seem different from everyone else But the greatest thing about this movie was the atmosphere that has been described in books by Gibson Sterling and others It was just fun to see it on TV
1,I can understand why others reacted rather unpleasantly towards the climax yielding a twist that really is hard to take seriously I think though that the buildup to it works rather well The music quite menacing and spinetingling really provides a spooky aura matching the unforgiving sound of a constant ringing telephone that is driving struggling English actress Joan MatlinJean Marshbonkers Shes borrowing a pals nice apartment while attempting to jumpstart her career in New York Citythe city buildings outside the window look about as realistic as David Lettermansand is unceremoniously welcome by a noisy telephone which rings quite a bit followed by loud slams against the wall Searching for answers regarding the one responsible for such disregard towards her sanity Joan discovers that no one rents that room and that a former tenant had in fact strangled herself Without help from the manager Joan will decide to find out for herself who is causing her such anguish Joan discovers the room empty and the phone with a particular female voice which will haunt her The episode I think is a tourdeforce for Jean Marsh who is a one woman show Shes the only actress visible and we follow her through the crisis which slowly erodes her the phone and the banging from that other room causing her much distress which grows into fear Instead of leaving Joan remains so shaken by the noise and to the breaking point where she just wishes for the phoneor whoever is ringingto stop The episode provides a possible answer as to who is plaguing Joan and why A character named Beth comes into the story rather late as Joan struggles to find out whose female voice it was across the other line who knew her name on that dreaded phone she discovers in the room across from hers The fate of Beth might just tell the viewer why Joan is being traumatized I think this episode is an exercise in spooks instead of credibilitysome didnt particularly like it but I certainly did I will admit that the phone as a physical menace crawling towards Joan is hard to take seriously not to mention its attack on her but I thought the intense opening twenty minutes before this were suitably chilling enough to make up for it
1,Its not a movie but an experience Not the usual eye candy I thought it would be Too many things are happening at once your senses almost couldnt handle it A product of cuttingedge technology we were torn between just sitting back to enjoy the show and putting our 3D glasses on and off to decipher the magic the music is great its a concert the Disney characters are in it and you get to BE part of their world its funny its magical its excitingI know this is beginning to sound like an advertisementbut it really is that awesome Beats Christmas in bringing out the kid in you This attraction alone already makes going to Disney all worth it 
1,The plot of this movie is set against the most terrible war in history of mankind the violent clash between Adolf Hitlers Germany and Soviet Russia from 194145 With the western areas of their country thoroughly devastated and 20 to 30 million Russian people killed the vibes of this conflict can be felt in Russia up to the present day Let alone back in 1957 when memories were still very fresh and painful This very black setting strongly contrasts with the fine and coherent style of Letjat zhuravlis beautiful shots Its simple story deals with human behaviour in times of war bravery love patriotism weakness cowardice and corruption All beautifully tied together by a toysquirrel Add to this the truly magnificent acting and its easy to understand why this movie is so famous Really one of the very best ever made  
1,This film is about a single mother who is happy go lucky to the point that she is almost irresponsible and her sensible teenage daughter who is undergoing adolescent turmoils Anywhere But Here is an engaging film from beginning to the end Both Ann and Adele are described well right at the start so we get to know how different their personalities are Clashes inevitably ensue and they are engagingly presented I find myself so drawn to their state of minds and their circumstances it is as if I am living their lives feeling what they are feeling Susan Sarandon gives another excellent performance in Anywhere But Here She is charismatic happy go lucky hedonistic warm and loving all at once I have always liked Susan Sarandon and I think she is grossly underrated Anywhere But Here is a captivating emotional journey
1,Robin Hood Men in Tights has received no respect whatsoever It was hilarious Cary Elwes was excellent as the Prince of Thieves and David Chappelle Amy Yasbeck Patrick Stewart Richard Lewis and Mark Blankfield as Blinkin all did fine jobs I will never understand the hostility toward Robin Hood Men in Tights but I do know a great comedy when I see one Robin Hood Men in Tights receives  out of 
1,This is probably the funniest thing I have ever seen  from start to finish it was perfect in timing atmosphere punch lines background music fighting sequences and every other possible aspect you can think of To be absolutely honest i find this movie as funny as their Rik  Ades sitcom Bottom  maybe even funnier I laughed constantly throughout the whole movie and can only recommend seeing this film However if you watch it without knowing or liking the type of comedy Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson has done before you might not think its funny at all  but I REALLY cant understand those who dislike it  THIS IS HUMOUR FOLKS People getting hit with frying pans guys running around wearing red rubber lingerie green vomit filling the hallways guys getting kicked in the bs and getting candlesticks in the eyes  HOW can this NOT be funny 1010
1,One of my favorite Hartley movies As if there could be a bad one Although this may be a bit more on the religious side of things than we would normally expect Nonetheless it still maintains that Hartley slant to which weve all become accustomed First picture Jesus and Satan discussing their ideas opinions hopes and regrets about the impending end of civilization Now imagine the entire conversation taking place over a few drinks in your neighborhood bar And as an added conversational not to mention visual distraction lets toss in PJ Harvey as the sultry companion aka Magdelena to Mr Chist Then just for grins in the background an ever present Salvation Army Band played by Yo La Tengo to serve as an added diversion The road to moral justification has never been such a pleasure Quite possibly more questions than answers but therein lies the fun And Mr Donovan is subdued brilliance as always
1,Fires on the plain directed by Kon Ichikawa and written by Shohei Ooka and Natto Wada is a World War two movie which is finally not showing the allies fighting the axis powers but the Japanese fighting and struggling for their lives on the Philippines The main characters name is Tamura  played by Eiji Funakoshi and he is a soldier leaving his regiment because of him being sick All he has on him is a hand grenade his gun and some potatoes Like this he is trying to make his way to the hospital in order to get a doctor and a cure for his disease But since the hospital turned him away and gets destroyed he begins a long walk Throughout the whole movie Tamura remains a bit cowardish but very civil when the other soldiers become more like animals by using their basic instincts for survival Tamura is still remaining human and would not degrade A scene which has influenced me a lot to think positively and different about this war movie is when Tamura comes into a Phillipino village which is completely deserted There he fights a dog and finds a lot of corpses of Japanese soldiers stacked up in front of a church This makes Tamura think and even more scared than he already is That shows that the soldier is not a brave killing machine but a servant to higher beings and human most importantly After he turns away from the corpses two Phillipinos a couple or brother and sister  very close relationship return to the village in order to get their stash of salt back The main character of the movie wants to be friendly at first although he walked up to them with his gun but shoots the woman once she starts screaming Her brotherboyfriendhusband then runs away in fear and after a moment Tamura follows him and shoots wildly at the fleeing Filipino He does not hit him After Tamura picks up the bag of salt  something very precious  he drops his gun into a river This gesture is very important in order to understand Kon IchikawasShohei Ookas profiling of Tamura and the war Comparing this movie to other World War 2 movies it is not typical at all Of course all movies have suffering heroes but their heroes are more heroic than Tamura He expresses everything that is human he is getting manipulated  he is weak  he gets scared  he has hope This is typical for Japanese World War two movies and for Japanese society Since World War two is not a discussed theme in Japanese society Japanese are likely to put Japanese in the second World War in the role of the victim This victimisation is also very visual in this movie One of the examples is Tamura another one the piled up bodies of Japanese soldiers in front of the church and another important one is when the Japanese soldiers are trying to cross a street and the Americans are already waiting there for them and shooting all of the Japanese soldiers which have worse equipment and are fed worse and have no health equipment or anything alike In my personal conclusion I have to say that it is worth seeing this film in order to finally see a movie from the other side than usual It also has no nationalistic propaganda which couldve been easily built in Once you have watched the movie fully you will be able to see the horrors of the second World War to its total extent
1,I was very excited to see Rock Star because I am a big fan of Mark Wahlbergs I was surprised to have liked it more than I originally thought I would The script did leave something to be desired but the movies performances made up for it There were a few moments when visions of Spinal Tap came rushing back and I cant help but think this movie would have been even better as a mocumentary But I digress Wahlberg continues to demonstrate his talent as he plays with believability an ordinary guy whose biggest dream comes true He does it with the wonder and innocence that make you not only believe him but also make you really care about his character Jennifer Aniston who hasnt impressed me in movies up to this point is surprisingly good as the girlfriendmanager She shows more real emotion than Ive seen in her last few movies combined But above all its the music in this movie that really draws you in Peppered with some 80s tunes lets face it  Bon Jovi would have any 80s music fans rocking in their seat the movie really rocks with the original Steel Dragon songs and Wahlbergs performance of them I plan to see this movie again but first Im going to rush out and buy the soundtrack
1,I caught this flick on the trail end of a tape I had used to capture a movie I truly wanted to wanted to see again When I saw Raquel Welchs name in the opening credits I decided to watch it It was actually mildly entertaining and took me back in the wayback machine to the farcical movies that Hollywood churned out during the sixties much in the same genre as the current Austin Powers stuff Oh the acting was not superb nor was the plot but it was worth watching There was some delightful scenery although Ms Welch provided the most pleasant of such Tape it if you get the chance and watch it when you have absolutely nothing else to do It is not a snoozer but it wont have you rolling in the aisles wanting more either
1,In World War II a badly burned amnesiac known only as The English Patient is found in the African desert and is transported to Italy where he joins a convoy of medical troops and others at an abandoned monastery Among them are Hana Juliette Binoche a Canadian nurse whose lovers generally meet unpleasant ends Kip Naveen Andrews and Hardy Kevin Whately two explosives experts who search the monastery for bombs and David Caravaggio Willem Dafoe a Canadian soldieroffortune who knows the identity of the English patient and has a score to settle Through flashbacks we learn the story of the Patient he is Laszo Almasy Ralph Fiennes a Hungarian explorer who in the late 30s falls in with a group of British cartographers including Geoffrey Clifton Colin Firth and his wife Katharine Kristen ScottThomas while mapping the deserts of North Africa After Clifton leaves them on government business Katharine and Clifton fall in love with each other in the desert resulting in an affair that naturally has a lessthanhappy ending If one is able to overlook the illogical parts of the story line such as why would a patient found in Africa be sent to what is essentially the front line of the war in Italy then you can appreciate The English Patient as a throwback to the intelligent layered sweeping epics of David Lean in the 60s Much more than Titanic or other epic romances of late this movie puts one in mind of Doctor Zhivago and Gone With the Wind  an epic love story set against a huge historical backdrop You shouldnt expect a war film though there are some striking if alltoobrief scenes of violence that stand out more than the romantic sections as is usually the case Caravaggios interrogation by a sadistic SS officer Jurgen Prochnow in particular The movie is very ambiguous in regards to pretty much everything The central question of the film is How far are you willing to go for love As critics of the movie are fast to point out Almasy is on the surface a farfromlikable character  he has an affair with a married woman and betrays his country by giving maps and intelligence to the Germans causing the death of his friend Madox Julian Wadham and the torture of Caravaggio and actually killing a British soldier who has him under arrest at one point The fact that Almasy is in many ways reprehensible is kind of the point  hes in love with Katharine and sees the world narrowly in terms of his love that loyalty to country or anything else for that matter is secondary as Almasy says he hates Ownership Being owned The two engage in a rather bold love affair shagging within ear shot of hundreds of people at a Christmas party and its clear that Katharine is more drawn to the mysterious exciting Almasy than the comparatively boring Geoffrey The 1944 subplot is somewhat shaky and seems superfluous the romance between Kip and Hannah is never completely believable and I feel the film could have done without it But those sequences do add an interesting texture of mystery and complexity to the film so I wont complain too much Like the epics mentioned above the film is able to convey time and place through simple devices like crowd scenes strategically placed posters and military presence We do not need to dwell on the fact that its 1938 in Cairo but its helpful to know The direction of Anthony Minghella and the desert cinematography by John Seale are absolutely gorgeous the sand dunes sand storms and haunting caves of the desert are captured in beautiful detail Gabriel Yareds score is haunting and atmospheric The acting is generally solid Fiennes gives a very layered performance as a character who is mysterious complex and haunted The difference between the Almasys of 1938 and 1944 are remarkable one exciting and somewhat carefree the other haunted and reflective Kirsten Scott Thomas is effective as Katharine the female explorer looking for adventure and Colin Firth gives one of his best performances as Geoffrey who realizes early on that hes no competition for the exciting Almasy Willem Dafoe does nice work as Caravaggio the shifty hunted thiefturnedspy driven by revenge Jurgen Prochnow gives a performance reminiscent of Jose Ferrer in Lawrence of Arabia and a similar character too very brief but more memorable then some of the major characters Some of the 1944 actors are unremarkable Juliette Binochette is nothing special while Naveen Andrews is good but unremarkable Kevin Whately as Kips illfated partner does what he can with a rather smallish role The English Patient is not a perfect movie by any means but the vituperative attacks on it by much of the moviegoing public are not deserved at all Maybe its a show of how film sensibilities have changed since the era of the Leans and Kubricks or maybe people were expecting something simple to understand Complex to fault brilliantly directed and shot The English Patient is a wonderful modernday epic 810
1,Screamers is an Italian fantasy film LIsola degli Uomini Pesce bought by Roger Corman and released through his New World Pictures Of course Corman has to carve his initials on it by having one of his lackeys Dan T Miller direct some additional gore footage before he has it released in the states LIsola degli Uomini Pesce is a very entertaining retelling of the Island of Dr Moreau It is 1891 and Claudio Cassinelli is shipwrecked on a mysterious island with a few newly escaped convicts Claudio comes across the stellar Barbara Bach and Richard Johnson Johnson plays the dastardly Edmund Rackham a man who is able to manipulate scientist Joseph Cotton into turning the local native population into amphibious deepsea diving creatures they look like a cross between the Black Lagoon creature and one of The Humanoids From the Deep by convincing Cotton that the mutations are being created for the highest of scientific and humanitarian motives Having discovered the lost city of Atlantis Rackham is using the amphibious creatures to loot its treasures Sexy Barbara Bach plays Cottons daughter who has a psychic link with these mutations In one memorable scene Bach takes a midnight swim with these mutants wearing only a thin white cotton dress that leaves little to the imagination Claudio discovers one of the convicts he has befriended has been turned into a gillcreature and then all Hell breaks loose Filmed at the same time and in the same location as Zombi 2 Richard Johnson didnt even have to change suits between films The house where the experiments take place is the same house Johnson uses to conduct experiments in Zombi 2 Talk about economic filmmaking The additional footage features a few bloody beheadings way to go Roger and a laughably bad Cameron Mitchell doing his best pirate imitation All thats missing is the parrot Spanish title Le Continent Des Hommes Poissons
1,Seeing Other People is a daring romantic comedy about a couple named Ed and Alice Jay Mohr and Julianne Nicholson who are engaged and plan to be wed soon They live together but are both having doubts about their relationship Alice realizes shes had so few sexual relationships in the past she might just be marrying Ed because shes never felt anything else So they agree to begin fooling around with other people for a while to test their own relationship The movie balances a prescient question  by focusing too much on the What if aspects of life can it in fact do the opposite and only make you feel more constrained When Ed begins having sex with a college girl he begins to become addicted and almost forget about Alice  when he realizes this it scares him I hadnt heard anything about this film in advance but I enjoyed it Its not extremely wellmade and definitely has that purposefully lowbudget indie feel to it  but its a lot better than most romantic comedies out there in the mainstream today Check it out if you get a chance
1,with two old friends Ive always enjoyed both Lemmons and Mathaeus films and of course their team efforts are always worth watching and often hilarious Although I didnt personally regard this film as in the hilarious category it is certainly a competent and entertaining vehicle for fans of the two principle actors and of 60s style romantic comedy plots Brent Spiner may actually steal the show in terms of laughs as the arrogant and tyrannical Cruise Director Gloria DeHaven proves that senior ladies can remain enormously attractive
1,I saw this black and white comedy noir yesterday at the London film Festival Structurally it has been compared to Pulp Fiction but it is perhaps closer to the structure of Amores Perros and the slacker mood of Kevin Smiths Clerks Four stories intersect at a French motorway diner The first vignette has Franck Edouard Baer bungling a hold up at the diner The waitress Suzie Anna Mouglalis takes pity and tell him her story The second has two incompetent kidnappers Leon Bouli Lanners and Paul Serge Lariviere take a teenage girl from her rich family Unfortunately for them she is suicidal and her family dont appear to want her back The third is a dialogue between two ageing rock stars who bump into each other at the diner Alain Bashung and Arno playing themselves The final part is about four excriminals who smuggle their old partner out of hospital to visit their old hideout which has since been turned into  the diner An epilogue returns to Franck and Suzie to complete their story not really an epilogue more a conclusion The structure does not really work The stories are not sufficiently intertwined as in Pulp Fiction Nor is the diner crucial to the action to at least two of the stories in the way the car crash was crucial in the four stories of Amores Perros The quality of the individual stories varies The hideout story is a cute idea with a couple of good gags but does not come off and the rock star reunion is pointless and dull On the other hand the kidnap story is hilarious although its connection to the diner is tenuous The most balanced and successful story is the Franck and Suzie one This film isnt entirely successful but has moments of interest and hilarity I look forward to seeing more of Writerdirectors Samuel Benchetrits work
1,David Morse and Andre Braugher are very talented actors which is why Im trying so hard to support this program Unfortunately an irrational plot and very poor writing is making it difficult for me Im hoping that the show gets a serious overhaul or that the actors find new projects that are worthy of them
1,this is an adaptation of a Dirk Wittenborn book which I did not read young Finn Earl lives with his Mom Liz Diane Lane in a cramped lower East Side New York Apartment he dreams of joining his Anthropologist father studying a fierce tribe in South America Liz has boyfriends and does coke when he is caught scoring coke for her one of her customers Liz is a legitimate masseuse a rich Mr Osborne bails her out in return for being his full time personal masseuse in his huge estate in New Jersey They are driven there in a limo with her strung out lying in the back seat with her dress hitched way up and panties showing this and a few lowcut dress scenes is the only exploitation of Ms Lane some may be disappointed but Im sorry she had to do all that stuff in Unfaithful to make the AList That lady has more talent in her little finger than Streep Roberts and Sally Field do in their entire BODIES and its time she was given her due when they arrive Finn makes friends with Osbornes grandson Bryce and has a coming of age with his new girlfriend granddaughter Maya Liz meanwhile joins AA and dates an AA doctor She miraculously cleans up instantly Finn however does a lot of drugs along with sex with his new friends Bryce seems like an OK guy but gets jealous when Osborne takes Finn on a hot air balloon race instead of him and this leads to tragedy the genius of the story and movie is that they cut from the violent acts of the Fierce filthy rich Blysdale tribe to the Yanomano warriors Its a little implausible though that when Liz finds out what happens to her son she merely demands action from Osborne and does not either contact the authorities or settle it Thelma and Louise style there are elements of a Gothic Romance with a revelation by the village idiot Also they do almost no plot or character development prior to the move to Blysdale Liz for instance like Lanes Pearl Kantrowitz in Walk on the Moon had an unwanted pregnancy with Finn at 18 and felt trapped This is in the book but not the movie Still these are minor shortcomings The movie will be in full release 123105 over a year after the original release date and I just couldnt wait There were lots of Red Carpet moments in the theater I saw the movie at with almost the whole castexcept Diane Lane Q Director Dunne said she was off filming a movie I know she didnt promise to be there but I came from way out of town and it would have been such a thrill to see her in person The movie is a definite Best Picture contender as for acting Sutherland was quite good and so was the boy who played Finn Lane was magnificent as always but I only recall one or two emotional scenes when she catches Finn with drugs lets get fd up together mother and son and with Osborne your twisted grandson She would fare better with a supporting actress nod but it wont work that way unless they give it to her for a body of work
1,Three words Piece of Art This film is just great Its beautiful sad frightening and thoughtprovoking at the same time The score constantly stays in my head the acting is wonderful the scenery scary and beautiful at the same time It was more by chance than on purpose that I saw this movie At the time I decided to watch this movie I was just bored and read lists of Asian films which maybe good Well I saw the title A tale of two sisters which sounded very interesting Then I read the summary of the plot and decided You dont just watch this film youve gotta buy it Said done I bought this film and was hooked from the very first minute The plot kept me interested from the beginning till the end the twist near the end of the film made me scream I really didnt see something like this coming And the ending scene made me cryit just made me cry It was so sad Well I recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a film that combines an interesting plot with scary scenes and atmosphere Although you should be aware of the fact that the ending is as I mentioned before a very sad one But this just fits in the mood of the film doesnt it
1,Captain Corellis Mandolin is no Oscar contender but it was pretty good I have to admit Ms Cruz can really act She puts on a very good performance In fact she our does her boyfriend Tom in drama John Hurt was great as usual Nicholas Cage seemed to be enjoying himself I bet he felt he was going back to his roots as an Italian However I did learn something One more chapter in Horrors of Nazi Germany the many Italian soliders killed during the period of there surrender to the allies and Germanys eventual surrender
1,In 1927 a young man alone in a single engine aeroplane flew nonstop from Roosevelt Field in New York across the entire North Atlantic Ocean to Le Bourget Field in Paris a distance of three thousand six hundred and ten miles In this triumph of mind body and spirit Charles A Lindbergh influenced the lives of everyone on earthfor in the 33 hours and thirty minutes of his flight the air age became a reality This is the story of that flight Billy Wilder adapts from Charles A Lindberghs Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same name in what is recreation of Lindberghs historical 1927 solo flight Boosted by a considerably strong lead performance from James Stewart himself a pilot as Lindberg and containing an intelligent screenplay from Wilder and Wendell Mayes Spirit Of St Louis is a sincerely well told story In what at times threatens to become a monotonous film Wilder keeps it ticking over by using flashbacks to Lindberghs life After the nicely told build up to the event such as the peril being realised as Nungesser and Coli go missing never to be found whilst attempting the same trip in reverse we learn stuff like how he come to buy his first plane and his work with the flying circus This is all relative to understanding the man and his obvious passion for flying This also helps to give us a complete picture of Lindbergh thus putting us with him in his isolated cockpit as he undertakes this dangerous journey Battling isolation his only company is a fly and chronic tiredness its here where Stewart perfectly portrays Lindberghs devotion to the task Aided by a terrific score from Franz Waxman and Academy Award nominated effects by Louis Lichtenfield Wilders movie turns out to be an engaging human interest story that got a thoroughly professional production 710
1,For people like me who were born long after the 60s ended we can only learn about the era through cultural artifacts of which Hair is one This is certainly a well done tour de force One can get a sense of how things were for the hippie culture Probably the most impressive scene  for me at least  is when the group crashes the rich peoples party As for the movies final scene one might interpret it as the symbolic end of everything that the 60s represented But no matter how one interprets this movie its important to understand that even though the 60s themselves may have ended the movements that typified them still exist in small enclaves Its a time that people wont soon forget Anyway this movie is one that I definitely recommend Milos Forman scored another great one here right between his two masterpieces One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest and Ragtime so why did he later make a piece of crap like Man on the Moon Starring John Savage Treat Williams and Beverly DAngelo
1,Every once in a while a film comes along with characters we all know and love A film where you see people you know portrayed on screen Its cinema very at its best Lackawanna Blues is that film Set in 1960s upstate New York the story surrounds a rock solid woman who is the foundation for her community This based on a true story film is told from a child she accepted as her own This child Ruben SantiagoHudson wrote the screenplay Emmy winner S Epatha Merkerson stars as Nanny a woman who has wit drive and determination for helping others in her boarding home She does this as she wrestles with infidelity from her young lover Bill Crosby played by the Oscar nominated Terrence Howard  But make no mistake see this film for the amazing performance of Merkerson who is brilliant in this role She encompasses a person we have all known and perhaps love Lackawanna Blues is already on DVD be sure to pick it up at your local video story today Merkerson has already won an Emmy Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild for this role Howard has an Oscar nomination for his role in Hustle  Flow
1,If you are a fan of early Duke movies this Lone Star oldie is a good one What more could you ask for than Duke Yak and Gabby Lots of good ridin and shootin I found it amazing that Dukes singing voice was Bill Bradbury who is none other than Bob Steeles twin brother It has been reported that Bob Steele was a high school classmate and friend of Duke so twin brother Bill may have been too Anyway if you like good clean early western movies dont miss this one We dont have to wonder about hidden meanings or try to figure out underlying themes Just sit back relax and enjoy a western movie from a simpler day and time Its called entertainment folks
1,I have watched every version of this play that I can think of including several on the stage and Sir Derek Jacobi is absolutely the best Hamlet I have ever seen  He has the most wonderful voice for stage acting and his expressive face will take you on a roller coaster of emotions throughout this play The way in which he delivers his lines takes you on a journey through madness He as Hamletcan in an instant be loving soft and gentle and in another instant be raging against the hell that is his life You believe that he is in pain you believe that he is angry you believe that he is not a little mad You believe he IS Hamlet Of course some of the thanks obviously goes to Shakespeare  but without an excellent actor to get the words from the page to the stage it doesnt really matter how well written a play is If you like Shakespeare you absolutely must see this version If you dont like Shakespeare you absolutely must see this version You will come away with a new appreciation for Shakespeare if you do The nuanced performance that Sir Derek gives will leave you breathless
1,Perry Mason The Case of the Fatal Fashion finds Perry and Della Street in New York getting an award from the American Bar Association An undefeated trial record ought to get some recognition I would think Anyway a friend of Dellas fashion editor Diana Muldaur gets herself arrested for the murder of a rival Valerie Harper and in fact Raymond Burr and Barbara Hale witness a confrontation between the two at a posh eatery These two rivals have a thing going that makes Hedda and Louella look like school girls Of course Harper has a number of other people who loved her equally as much The same perpetrator also ran down a fashion designer who could have exposed the individual This throws Perry with his trusty investigative lawyer William Moses in an alliance with some mobsters Seems that the designer was a cousin of a mob boss who wants also to mete out some justice in their usual manner  One thing I could not get is when Moses and mobster Robert Clohessy track down the perpetrator I cannot believe that the police were also not vigorously pursuing the case Of course Clohessy has some access to sources that the cops just dont have But the best part of this particular Mason entry is Scott Baio as the young rather full of himself Assistant District Attorney introducing himself to Raymond Burr saying how he studied all of his cases and looked forward to beating him Foolish Boy In fact my favorite scene is Burr and Baio at a sidebar with the judge Baio was wanting to reopen his case and add a witness and came ready and prepared with precedents Burr catches him off guard and says he has no objection to the new witness and then proceeds to demolish the witness on cross examination Absolutely priceless Scott Baio is the best thing in this particular Perry Mason movie and it should be seen for him alone if nothing else
1,Dead Man Walking is a film not about the death penalty but about the people involved in a death penalty case  the killer the families whose kids were killed the nun who becomes his spiritual advisor and what happens It tells the story with little fanfare but a lot of compassion and sensitivity I have it on DVD and every time I watch it not often its never an easy film to watch Im more impressed by what Tim Robbins and the entire cast did here So revealing that it could be a documentary so compelling you cant take your eyes away so subtle and yet so powerful Dead Man Walking is nothing short of a masterpiece It doesnt matter whether youre for or against the death penalty or even have no opinion this movie will have you thinking about the issues for sure It takes a courageous screenwriter and director to look this material in the face without flinching even once and everyone involved in the film pulls it off  there isnt a single scene that rings false A masterful film but dont expect light viewing to some the final scenes could be more graphic than anything imaginable even though no blood or violence is shown You get drawn into this film and become a participant and theres a character for just about everyone to identify with 1010
1,This was my second experience of the Monkey Island series the full seven years after I had been shown the first game What was my response Oh great were playing a cartoon Im glad my brother shut me up then and played on because the jokes caught my attention once again as well as Armatos wonderful voiceacting of Guybrush  not to mention everyone else done well I still think CMIs Elaine sounds better than EMIs The cutscenes do well to illustrate something happening and the art of both the game and cutscenes are excellent When we found the CD with the originals Secret and LeChucks Revenge we were both ecstatic and spent hours working through Revenge  one such moment was where we just sat down and blew half a day on it However CMI has to be the Monkey Island game Ive played the most especially for the return of swordfighting and combat on the high seas That moment when you encounter Kenny and he tells you hes gone straight and then Im running guns had both my brother and I in tears from laughter And thats not the best part of the game not by far
1,Great little short film that aired a while ago on SBS here in Aus Get a copy if you can  probably only good for a few viewings as youll end up remembering the script  and its the twists that make this film so funny Well directed and intriguingly scripted its an example of just how good lowbudget short films can be
1,If theres one good suspenseful film this is one of them James Stewart puts on a dazzling performance as American Dr Ben McKenna who with his wife and son are in Africa on tour They stumble on a murder scene and Dr McKennas son is kidnapped hours later Before you can say Fasten your seat belts Dr McKenna finds out too much about a assassination attempt and tries to stop it However other people know he can be dangerous dangerous to them that is and try to dispose of him Eventually Hank the son is found alive and well If you like suspenseful movies this is the one to watch My Score 810
1,If folks were really this stupid I could be the SRW  Supreme Ruler of the World In this one Knotts plays a dimwitted bean counter for some little jerk water town run by a group of crooked simpletons only slightly brighter than he is When things appear a bit shaky for the crooks they go for a frameup of the patsy Figg Plenty of laughs as Knotts does his usual bumbling stumbling act I especially appreciated the extension cord scene asininity at its highest level
1,I have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of Coppolas masterpiece I was lucky enough to meet Martin Sheen outside the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium one night in 1981 as he waited for Charlie and Emilio to leave a concert He was very humble about the praise I shared with him for this work of art especially his portrayal of the young Captain This is without a doubt a must see a complete 10 and an important part of American Film History Charlie Dont Surf Robert Duvalls famous line the other one does not need repeating as it has become an oft repeated anthem and his Pattonesque character will long be remembered as a classic American war hawk in the John Wayne tradition It is a surprise to see how young Laurence Fishburne looks
1,I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much This is one of the best period pieces on the Civil War that I have seen that tells a story of friendship divided by the war The costumes are great the story lines are great I love how the story jumps around from character to character to keep you guessing as to whats going to happen next in their lives There is a great balance of good and evil Some of the characters that are evil in my opinion are too good not to watch Every time something more despicable than the last happens I curse the TV as if they can hear me I love how this miniseries makes me feel engaged in its drama I would advise however NOT to watch the third movie in the DVD series Its a let down compared to the first two movies and most of the original characters do not return I dont wish to remember how the third movie ended I prefer to live with the thoughts of the ending in the second movie It makes me happy
1,I rented this movie but I wasnt too sure what to expect of it I was very glad to find that its about the best Brazilian movie Ive ever seen The story is rather odd and simple and above all extremely original We have Antonio who is a young man living in Nordestina a town in the middle of nowhere in the north east of Brazil and who is deeply in love with Karina The main conflict between the two is that while Antonio loves his little town and has no wish to leave it Karina wants to see the world and resents the place As a prove of his love for her he decides to go out himself and bring the world to her Hell put Nordestina in the map as he says And the way he does it is unbelievable This is a good movie might be a bit stagy for some people due to its different editing job but I think that its also that that improves the story Its just fun and it makes you feel good
1,On more than one level I can relate to what happens in this movie in a very personal way And all I can say about it is that its true what Dexters mom tells Eric at the end of the story he actually did cure her son by taking away his sad feelings and his loneliness This movie emphasis a philosophy I can very well agree with We are all going to die one day sooner or later In the end it is not the amount of time we live but the fungood timeshappiness we have during that time It is not the quantity but the quality that counts I guess all other words used here would only keep you any longer from getting to see this movie if you havent already I really would like to see it released on DVD Definitely it would be added to my all time classics right away
1,In this approximately 34second Thomas Edisonproduced short we see Annabelle Moore performing the Loie Fullerchoreographed Serpentine Dance in two different fantastical flowing robes Moore was one of the bigger stars of the late Victorian era She was featured in a number of Edison Company shorts including this one which was among the first Kinetoscope films shown in London in 1894 Loie Fuller had actually patented the Serpentine Dance which Moore performs here in robes as well as entire frames that are frequently hand tinted in the film presaging one of the more common symbolic devices of the silent era Supposedly the Moore films were popular enough to have to be frequently redone including refilming The version available to us now may be a later versionremake Moore became even more popular when it was rumored that she would appear naked at a private party at a restaurant in New York City She later went on to star as the Gibson Bathing Girl in the Ziegfeld Follies in 1907 She appeared there until 1912 The short is notable for its framing of motion which especially during the second half becomes almost abstract It somewhat resembles a Morris Louis painting even though this is almost 60 years before Louis relevant work You should be able to find this short on DVD on a number of different anthologies of early films
1,What a surprise this film was Ive seen a good few of Fulcis horror and zombie flicks and was amazed that this was by the same director He also wrote the screen play which shows that the chap was quite capable of crafting a detailed complex story line The dubbing on this is not good but far from the appalling slop that only further hinders later howlers like Manhattan Baby The photography in this film is fantastic A strange almost futuristic highway appears throughout the film which focuses on a small town where young boys are being murdered A scene involving the beating of a woman is uncomfortable to watch yet refreshing in comparison to usual cinema violence  What went wrong Lucio Perhaps there is a strong case to suggest he had reached his peak with this film and it slowly went downhill after that
1,True stories make the best stories dont they Theres always something enjoyable about a story be it novel or movie or whatever simply by the fact that its real makes the story all the more fascinating This movie is based on a true story of two young American men one a government employee and falcon enthusiastChris Boyce Timothy Huttonand the otherAndrew Daulton Lee Sean Pennis a drug dealer These two begin selling government mostly CIA secrets in 1975 to the Soviet Union The film focuses on the human aspect of the two men as well as their growing personal problems especially Penns character with everworsening drug addictions rather than glorifying their status as traitors to America which would no doubt hurt the films credibility in the US Boyce gradually becomes more cautious and eventually frustrated and paranoid as their dealings drag on and they dig ever deeper into treacherous territory Daulton becomes more dependent and addicted to cocaine and heroin as he becomes more frightened and more desperate to maintain control over a situation he has no control overon top of which he already has problems with the law The torment of Boyce and Daultons families because of the way they lead their lives is also well portrayed and adds well to the idea that espionage against ones country even if thought to be done justly leads only to major problems and the ruination of livesincluding the degradation of the friendship and trust between the two main characters Heres the breakdown The Good Hutton and Penn each did extensive research on the characters to capture their individual look and feel so theyre portrayed with extensive depth and realism The acting is excellent The atmosphere of paranoia builds quite well The story is fascinating and of course as one based on actual events it has some added kick Nice sets The Soviets working with the Boyce and Daulton are portrayed very well and not stereotyped or given evil consciences just for the sake of making them look bad Didnt Hurt It Didnt Help The music is alright nothing perfect though Sound effects are occasionally a little iffysuch was the case with a lot of films from the seventies through the eighties The Bad Chris Boyce Timothy Hutton has a relationship with a woman that we hardly know Because of Boyces trouble brewing with the US and Soviet Governments her life can be put in jeopardybut this isnt as expanded upon as it feels it shouldve been Minor problem though The Ugly The apparent simplicity required to sell government secrets is a little unnerving Nothing like a constant state of unreadiness to keep the masses feeling as unsafe as possible Memorable Scene Seeing the first CIA report accidentally sent to the wrong place with the reason being rough night This was another film that suffered massive delays due to the controversial content of the story Studios and producers didnt see how a movie about two American traitors could ever be accepted by American audiences Luckily its filmed and portrayed with a high degree of class and quality Of course it helps that the traitorous antiheroes arent portrayed heroicallymore like a couple young men whove made gross errors in judgment in their lives As such it becomes a very human drama and one portrayed very well and very believably Acting 910 Story 1010 Atmosphere 810 Cinematography 810 Character Development 910 Special EffectsMakeup 810 little quantity high quality NuditySexuality 210 one scene in a strip club ViolenceGore 710 no gore just some violence Music 710 Direction 910 Cheesiness 010 Crappiness 010 Overall 810 If you like films about espionage and spies then you cant go wrong here If you like dramatic films with a strong focus on the humanity of the characters then this may also work for you Highly recommended wwwResidentHazardcom
1,Talk Radio is of course probably not the most well known of Stones films but dont let that put you off this film is ripe for discovery I defy anyone not to be entranced by it Along with the best performance of 80s cinema by Eric Bogosian for me along with JFKthis remains Stones finest moment Stone doesnt seem to comment much on it these days and didnt do a directors commentary on DVD like all his other films Stone has nothing to be ashamed of most directors would kill to get a shot  a film like this The claustrophobia of the studio is intense and the opinions of Champlain are still very crucial arguments for today The legalise all drugs speech is powerful and you might find yourself agreeing with himIn my opinion the film is about freedom of speech and how sometimes people dont like hearing things they dont agree withThe speeches and conversations with the listeners are very compelling even disturbing a chill ran down my spine when a crazed man calls Champlain saying he has to rape again because the city drives him crazy is totally shockingThe tension is sometimes unbearable with a scene when Heavy metaller Kent becomes unhinged of course Champlain does himself no favours by ridiculing him Champlainor should I say Bogosian is fearless in film and performance totally mesmerising a shame th Bogosians other big role was the villain in Under Siege 2dear godOne scene th didnt ring true was when Barrys boss DanAlec Baldwin gets him to calm down Barry doesnt seem to be the kind of person who shuts up and does as hes told it seemed a bit contrived and clichédThe scenes outside the studio are criticised for being too formulaic its true because Stone is trying to make the film more cinematic and allow the viewer to see Champlains beginnings but it doesnt entirely work  It is a brilliantly cinematic film with extreme closeups deep focus extremely fast cuts a fantastic 360 set which is used for the final breathtaking monologue Must see cinema it makes it rare because it was ignored the time but is now receiving attention again which it so richly deserves A classic th should be studied by generations of film students  10 out of 10 for inventive use of Bad To The Bone before T2 brilliant supporting cast including John C McginleyDr Cox from Scrubs as the sleazy Stu Leslie Hope24as Champlains girlfriend John Pankow and Alec Baldwin as the suits and Micheal Wincott who plays three roles a very underrated actor the tension between the listeners and Champlain which is very heartracing  times and of course kudos to the stars Bogosian and Stone for such a fantastic piece of cinema Enjoy
1,This is a 100 improvement over the dross of a third movie and its one hell of a good time This is a John Hughes movie meets The Devils Rejects I really enjoyed this movie and it really stands out as the savior of the series I thought Jennifer Tilly played Tiffany really well and Brad Dourif in Chuckys shoes once again really makes this movie shine Actually theyre the only good parts of the movie I got rather bored with Katherine Heigl and Nick Stables scenes Its as if they were thrown in there as a sidetrack and someone to save the day But Chucky and Tiffany were great to watch and I really liked the black humor to it I thought it made the movie stand out more If you want one hell of a good time then be sure to check this out 710
1,I had no expectations when I started to watch this movie How surprised I was This is a great beautiful twisted movie which will give your mind a good workout Its not simple If you only enjoy Police Academy style nobrains movies this is not for you The Cell is a deep complex film with influences from movies like Cube Silence of the Lambs and The Lawnmower Man along with lots of completely new ideas Wonderful twisted environments good acting and a compelling story makes this one of the best films I have seen in a long time Be openminded and you will love it
1,Despite the title and unlike some other stories about love and war this film isnt too sticky and pink because love is as a rose With thorns that is The four leading actors set their characters realistic and with a good sense and balance between the tragic and the downtoearth  The music and lyrics of the cabaretchansonesquire songs sung b Keira Knightley herself drag the viewer deeper and deeper in the film from one place to another between the brutal war and amongst the peaceful love Some people may find it too much a biopic but it ís mostly a romantic story even though it consequently follows the life of Dylan Thomas and the triangular relationship which is steeped by joy and jealousy  London gets visualized from another angle for once the bohemian life of Dylan during the bombings of the Germans is set in a floating atmosphere of small bedrooms pubs and bars The independent women the soldier and the charismatic poet are constantly swept in both feelings of love and anger  Maybe the end is too twisted and hangs somewhat loosely to the rest of the film but all in all this is a great romantic story
1,The questions and answers of the human spirit are all here in this masterfully crafted historical documentary The shear beauty and horror of one mans walk through life are revealed in totality Dieter and Herzog are combined and connected through a mental maze that has been transformed into a single straight hallway which the walls have been plastered with images created by one mans characterization of himself by the vibrations of his own vocal chords This film for about 80 minutes have discovered a new dimension of storytelling What do I call this apparently new sense Only God knows after all isnt a MIRACLE something that God does for us but chooses to remain ANONYMOUS This is a requirement to see If you like to experience the lovely horror of war this documentary will cleanse your soul to the marrow
1, First of all I reviewed this documentary because I had an interest in the subject it portrayed the LA punks I listened that music and I loved that music and I read a lot of the small zines that were made in the early 80s and that were not so easily achieved in Finland So if you dont like this kind of music why you write here about it I like this kind of music it speaks my soul thus I know punks from all over Europe  Americas so why do you who find this music repugnant care to comment at all 
1,This is marvelous movie about a soul of Ale This is a journey to Ales heart I found it fascinating The director did a great job He makes the scenes talk Especially on the silent scenes The window of Ale is a great one An the scenes when he lies in bed are one of the best directed scenes I have seen  Apart from directing It has been a quite time I did not watch a movie about a soul As a philosopher I can say that this film proves that the age does not matter about your soul So as Ales soul  As living in Turkey I do not care about the other side of NY This is a universal scene you can see everywhere in the world As to my opinion more universal than every other thing  Do not miss this film Otherwise you will miss a great thing about a soul If you have one  BarisSentuna
1,This was on odd film I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children SPOILER AHEAD Ironically the main character murders a federal official Then hes a fugitive on the run They later blow up his house and then he finally commits suicide Seems like they should have just made it a film for a more mature audience or made it more family friendly This was on odd film I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children SPOILER AHEAD Ironically the main character murders a federal official Then hes a fugitive on the run They later blow up his house and then he finally commits suicide Seems like they should have just made it a film for a more mature audience or made it more family friendly
1,Back in the 60s this grim study of Joy a young proletarian wife was the introduction to the career of Ken Loach who became one of the most distinguished and respected British filmmakers of all time By then I knew very little about Brecht politics or the reality of the underprivileged and I was quite impressed by the aesthetic of the film its free style its austere color cinematography and Joys monologues in front of the camera I was also much surprised to find that Terence Stamp who had become a celebrity thanks to Billy Budd The Collector and Modesty Blaise had so little screen time Although 20th Century Fox distributed Poor Cow in Panama Loach did not stay in mainstream cinema which this film hardly is and I lost contact with his films I just heard of his successes Kes Family Life Black Jack until I caught up in the 80s The beautiful title song by Donovan by the way is available in his anthology Troubadour
1,THE NEXT KARATE KID in my opinion is an excellent martial arts flick I thought that Eric Chris Conrad and Julie Hilary Swank looked good in their prom attire To me Ned Michael Cavalieri was a real bully This was because he got Julie in trouble with Principal Wilkes Eugene Boles If you ask me Colonel Dugan Michael Ironside was a pure a This was because he was a very harsh man who wouldnt tolerate mistakes My favorite parts were the prom and the showdown between Julie and the Alpha Elite In conclusion I highly recommend this smash hit to all of you who like martialarts flicks or are fans of Hilary Swank
1,I was really surprised to see that unlike most documentaries this was written directed and produced by a film critic Richard Schickel Most of the times I know of where film critics had major involvement in films the films turns out to be bombs Rex Reed starring in Myra Breckenridge and Roger Ebert writing Beyond the Valley of the Dolls are prime examples However in this case the critics powers are used for good and not eviland the results are better though this isnt saying much as the films I just mentioned are among the worst films ever made As for the documentary its narrated by Clint Eastwood a pretty good choice and manages to discuss his long careerfrom his silent days until his death in the early 1960s The only negatives and they are slight are that the film is awfully short as are most film documentaries and there is very little about Gary Cooper as a human beingyou really dont learn all that much about his life However as a nice overview of his films it works very well
1,I honestly have to say that A CAT IN THE BRAIN is one of the most fun and unintentionally hilarious films Ive ever seen This film is packed with stupid dialog ridiculous scenes and a selfinvolving plot starring legendary horror director Lucio Fulci himself The threadbare storyline is about an aging director Fulci who is also named Lucio Fulci in the filmwho is starting to go nuts and hallucinate because of all the vicious things hes put down in film over the past many years He goes to a shrink who hypnotizes Fulci and tells him that he will believe himself to be a killer but that the shrink will actually be the one doing the killing The rest of the film is made up of shots from the film that Fulci is directing during all this action scenes of the shrink killing people allthewhile grinning like a fcking moron and some of Fulcis hallucination sequences Oh and a few tits thrown in for good measure as well A CAT IN THE BRAIN is completely overtopand ridiculous in every sense The gore is classic Fulci  nasty and strong with some really decent scenes The chainsaw sectioning of a female corpse is pretty cool as is the chainsaw beheading of a small boy Lots of stabbings gougings and other cool killscenes make this one a pretty nonstop bloodbath The ridiculous dialog LICK ITLICK IT as well as some of the insanely goofy scenes the Nazi orgy the opera singing slapfest and the running down of an innocent hippy come easily to mind make this one fun as hell Not nearly as dark as some of Fulcis other films  CAT is more of a selfindulgent horrorcomedy that if it wasnt meant to be funny is actually kind of sad I say to grab a fifth of cheap bourbon and settle in to this one I watched CAT with a few friends and we laughed the entire time THIS is the feelgood movie of the summerRecommended 810
1,In The Book of Life Martin Donovan plays Jesus who shows up at JFK airport on December 31 to usher in the new millennium by battling with Thomas Jay Ryan Satan and deciding the fate of the world There is also David Simonds Kurt the accountant from Amateur as a compulsive homeless gambler As usual Hartley creates a surreal world in which the beauty of the ordinary made strange and otherworldly flows through artfullyframed scenes and urbanindustrial landscapes filled with dazzling light and shadow As usual he introduces seemingly incidental details early then brings them back later in hilarious and unexpected contextsthe humor is simple but giddy and irrepressible Hartley has an amazing ability to build toward small and rapturous moments of the simultaneously mundane and outrageous As usual he creates a tone that is jaded and worldweary but at the same time vulnerable open and honest He moves within minutes from uproarious humor into language that is metaphysical and poeticthe kind of writing that is so deadon and perfect that its difficult to hold back tears despite the lack of obvious emotion Another awesome and highly entertaining film The Book of Life is shot a digital camera with a blurry effect a sense of the celestial handinhand with impending doom and a hyperawareness of the present as fragile and fleeting in its last moments All of Hartleys films have a way of prioritizing the present but this unique effect compounds it as the images wash across the screen in a way that is at first jarring but becomes increasingly beautiful as you settle into it The final shot is spectacular All this may sound precious but the film is a comedy and it makes fun of itself even as it makes fun of the concept of Armageddon Judgment Day and urbanity Although it is actually quite profound moving and lifeaffirming it is for the most part lighthearted and playful The acting is flawless in terms of the kind of the subdued tone that Hartley has developed in his films a tone that some people dont get and that prompts them to judge such acting as hollowthe same people who have a negative response to Peter Greenaway As always there are bound to be people who respond to this film with cynicism and scornpeople put off by Hartleys abrupt shifts and what they see to be pretentious or mannerist techniquesbut anyone who is a Hartley fan will love this film if they can get a chance to see it that is Its hard to say what it would be like on video
1,This film is a fine example of why the Shaw Brothers are among the finest directors probably the best in the Kung Fu category The movie is well paced the story is excellent and intriguing and while the humor may not be in your face it is nested within the character interactions Once the story builds up and the characters begin to assess the situation does the whole tower come crashing down in one of the best fight scenes tiger crane and crab Hung Gar are very present There is even a scene that mocks 18th century Western social events and ends with clever and entertaining fighting The movie ends with a sudden cheesy moment but if you are a fan of the Shaw Brothers youll understand that the cheese is just a topping and not the main course of the movie
1,this movie has a great chase scene if you listen to the soundtrack when the cars are chasing each other  it sounds very much like the soundtrack from the movie bullet youll hear the shifting of a 4 speed and theyll show the brake pedal in Roy Schneiders car its an automatic brake pedal i think one of the funniest moments in the movie is when the bad guy Richard lynch is looking at the driver of the car they are in like the guy is nutsthe crook who runs the garage is also the guy who in the the first rocky movie rockys boss good movie also when the door gets ripped off you can see the guy sitting in the car just flinging the door open the guy who helps him out of the car kind of looks like Mr Brady from the Brady bunch doesnt he
1,In the 70s in Afghanistan the Pushtun boy Amir Zekeria Ebrahimi and the Hazara boy Hassan Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada who is his loyal friend and son of their Hazara servant Ali Nabi Tanha are raised together in Amirs father house playing and kitting on the streets of a peaceful Kabul Amir feels that his wise and good father Baba Homayoun Ershadi blames him for the death of his mother in the delivery and also that his father loves and prefers Hassam to him In return Amir feels a great respect for his fathers best friend Rahim Khan Shaun Toub who supports his intention to become a writer After Amir winning a competition of kitting Hassam runs to bring a kite to Amir but he is beaten and raped by the brutal Assef Elham Ehsas in an empty street to protect Amirs kite the coward Amir witness the assault but does not help the loyal Hassam On the day after his birthday party Amir hides his new watch in Hassams bed to frame the boy as a thief and force his father to fire Ali releasing his conscience from recalling his cowardice and betrayal In 1979 the Russians invade Afghanistan and Baba and Amir escape to Pakistan In 1988 they have a simple life in Fremont California when Amir graduates in a public college for the pride and joy of Baba Later Amir meets his countrywoman Soraya Atossa Leoni and they get married In 2000 after the death of Baba Amir is a famous novelist and receives a phone call from the terminal Rahim Khan who discloses secrets about his family forcing Amir to return to Peshawar in Pakistan in a journey of redemption I am not familiar with the Afghan culture and I did not read this novel in spite of the recommendation of my daughter and yesterday I decided to watch this movie on DVD I found a good story of loyalty cowardice betrayal and redemption with a brief insight in the recent history of Afghanistan from a peaceful period in the 70s to the present days with the Taliban The actors and actresses have great performances giving credibility to the realistic story The arid locations in China recall the images we see in television from Afghanistan In the end I found The Kite Runner a good movie My vote is seven Title Brazil O Caçador de Pipa The Kite Chaser
1,I was surprised how much I enjoyed this Sure it is a bit slow moving in parts but what else would one expect from Rollin Also there is plenty of nudity nothing wrong with that particularly as it includes lots of the gorgeous Brigitte Lahaie There are also some spectacularly eroticised female dead bit more dodgey perhaps but most effective There is also a scifi like storyline with a brief explanation at the end but I wouldnt bother too much with that No here we have a most interesting exploration of memory and the effect of memory loss and to just what extent one is still alive without memory My DVD sleeve mentions David Cronenberg and whilst this is perhaps not quite as good as his best films there is some similarity here particularly with the great use of seemingly menacing architecture and the effective and creepy use of inside space As I have tried to indicate this is by no means a rip roaring thriller it is a captivating nightmare like movie that makes the very most of its locations including a stunning railway setting at the end
1,especially when looking at the amount of crap that has made it to DVD I found this movie very funny Rip Torn is classic with his barbs Rob Schneider if hilariously annoying as the overcompensating Ensign Bruce Dern makes a great villain The entire cast seems to be having a blast and its not at the expense of the audience If you like just plain fun comedy and arent looking too deeply into meaning you just might fall in love with this one
1,This thriller has so many twists and turns it had me on the edge of my seat I saw it on video some of the landscape at the bluff might have been a bit more spectacular on the big screen Cast has Sandra Bullock Ben Chaplin from The Truth About Cats  Dogs Michael Pitt Henry Parker in Dawsons Creek and Ryan Gosling 
1,I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to sexual adventurer I got to wondering why her sexual encounters seemed familiar Then I remembered Intro Psych 101 Lecture One of the lectures dealt with the PsychoSexual Stages of Developement basically the shift over time on what part of the body and its attendant stimulations gets our main attention as well as the changing emphasis on what gives us pleasure Alices first encounter is being bathed with emphasis on the genitals and bottom Her next encounter is an oral one with the Mad Hatters dingaling I forget the rest of the lecture and the order of Alices encounters but I do remember how well they matched Its interesting to see a skin flick with some brains behind it rather than the cliche Im here to deliver your pizza Lets screw I dont see how Kristin DeBells career could be wrecked by this film as it was her first film And Reagans tiresome hypocrisies had yet to mar this land when it was released but in a way he and his stooge Meese did affect Ms DeBell When Meese was staging his antipornography commission to distract people from his own criminal activities Meese hired the services of an antiporn activist named Judith Reisner Reisner was obsessed with images she perceived as child pornography She saw the Alice cover Ms DeBell did for Playboy and promptly announced she had scientifically proven that Ms DeBell was in fact a photo collage of parts from several grown women and the face of a ten year old Yeah right
1,Ive only seen this film once when it was shown on tv but I can still remember it 15 years later so that must say something about it I thought it was an intelligent look into schooling friendship bullying and the influence it can have leading into adult life The title really refers to how being good or bad at sports can either make you the lowest of the low or you will be tolerated by the cliques within school and even later on into adulthood if youre good at it this is set in a private school in England but it could be anywhere The main character is bad at games seeks revenge in later life which all culminates in a climactic confrontation on a cricket pitch I must admit I was gutted by the ending  it was powerful and saddening
1,This was a pretty good movie that was overall done quite well The idea about Mercy wont spoil was original also I think Angelina did a good job as one of her first movies The only things I frowned upon were some of the corny fight scenes wont spoil either I liked the first movie and I liked this one as well 710
1,May Contain Spoilers In no way shape or form does this movie break the horror movie mold Not by a long shot However it does deliver a creepy atmosphere believable enough characters and gore The story is simple and doesnt bother to unfurl itself anymore than it needs to A bunch of kids are killed in a mining accident back in the early 1900s Since then they have stalked and killed the residence of their sleepy little PA town in the mountains Simple they want revenge on the man that caused their death years and years ago Naturally his great great great grandson is in town and hes a real prick Along with that a mother and her two daughters inherit a run old house after the husband dies The eldest daughter is rebellious obnoxiousa typical teen The younger is curious brighteyed and gets in with the ghost children The creepiest part of this flick is the sheer emotionlessness of the children and they hack their way through victim after victim Excellent acting It was so spooky I mean the Children of the Corn flicks are one thingbut this topped any of those as for the creepy kids Worht a look I bought it before seeing it and I was not unhappy But Im a horror fan through and through
1,Ah the Outer Limits I love that show It was surpremely creepy or downright mysterious I loved all the genres of the show from horror to thriller to mystery whatever the genre it was good I guess I must have started watching way after it got canceled when Scifi showed it as reruns or played marathons of it It was a really good show I dont know all about the seasons and everything but I do remember that every time I saw the screen freak out and the voice on the TV say There is nothing wrong with your television Do not attempt to adjust the picture I would squeal with delight It was a good show and I enjoy watching it if it would come on I give it a healthy 8 out of 10
1,This is one of those movies when you are watching it you wonder whether it is documentary or fiction After the movie Ramin Bahrani answered many questions and we learned that the movie has a script Bahranis camera is silent he is not judgmental he almost erases director from the movie by purpose background is not organized to make the picture pretty however dont get me wrong there is a lot of preparation for this movie Starting on personal level being the part of environment being to be ignored when you film Main character is a real actor in every sense I would like to thank all crew for this movie showing us another country within NYC I strongly suggest it if you like stories of others Bora Kizilirmak
1,Reading through the comments there seems to be a lot of nonsense about the emotional banality of La Pianiste I find this hard to comprehend given the outstanding performance by Isabelle Huppert Huppert is gripping  she manages to convey perfectly the woman on the edge full of selfhate and delusion The film is wonderfully paced and judged It would be so easy to portray the lead as a ridiculous figure  consider the scene in the porn store for instance Somehow Huppert is able to carry it off partly because of her brilliant performance but also because the director makes her surreal life real and identifiable Dont ignore this film It is one of the most startling and engaging films and performances I have seen Trust Boris
1,A strange relationship between a middleaged woman and a transsexual who gonna be a woman soon Charlotte and Venorica both trapped by their inanimate lives and dont know how to get out of them Charlotte is an owner of a beauty clinic she has broken up with her aggressive exhusband moved into an apartment alone with all the furniture packed except her big bed Veronica lives downstairs with her poor dog Shes sensitive and desperately bothered by her mothers visiting and the bad relationship with her dad Her only hope is that the upcoming transsexual operation will turn her into a real woman and then everything will be fine All she can do now is waiting for an approval certificate Then these two individuals meet by chance and gradually they are all involved into others lives there are some sparkles between them but no one is brave enough to face the truth because they are not willing to accept the change as most people do Eventually the ending is quite satisfying and leaves some imagination for us to think about it The directors great work gives me an great impression she handles the development of characters very well the emotional atmosphere is quite full and intense Also I am so obsessed with the gloomy lights all over the apartment Delphic but full of desire Two main characters are played by Trine Dyrholm and David Dencik they are amazing in their roles a very impressive performance and the chemical reaction between them is genuine and convincing This Swedish indie film is about encountering and change no matter youre homosexual or heterosexual male or female the oddness of life exists everywhere whenever you fall across it youll be hesitate and bewildered but at least dont be afraid follow your heart and choose the right way
1,All the reviewers are making one big mistake This movie was not suppose to be taken seriously It was made for kids and teens of the late 80ies or early 90ies and as such it was truly a film of its time If you hated that period or love the first movie so much that you cant even take a joke about it then this is garbage but only because it wasnt meant for you The low budget here and failure of the Beastmaster 1 at the box office grossed under four mil with a nine mil budget were obviously the reasons to drop the seriousness of the original and to put it in the present day You can complain about the story dialog or logic but again this was made to run not to win races If the movie had tried to take itself seriously it would be a total failure but it doesnt do that for a second in our world Dar sees a movie theater thats advertising The Beastmaster 2 enough said To paraphrase Clint Eastwood from Dirty Harry movies This movie knows its limitations Its more of a comedyparody then usual adventure Soundtrack for the time was also great Actors arent taking themselves that seriously either so even the usually irritating spoiled rich brat role played here very well by young Kari Wuhrer turns out good  So if you are nostalgic for the 80ies90ies cheese culture or you liked the first part and dont mind going out on a cheese limb youll have tremendous fun with this attempt to revive Dar in the 90ies literarly This is not really the sequel to the first and dont watch it if thats what you want Its more of a what if fantasy sequel As for the why different dimension and not just different time question When in history did we have those tall winged humanoid creatures that suck the flash of bones from the end of part 1 By the way the movie ends in the Zoo because of an attempt at a cheap moneywise big finale Its suppose to be the best place for Dar to show all his moves him being the manipulator of animals
1,I saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it Since then Ive searched for a video but never found it until now 33 years later when I ordered it from Moviehunter Sorry to say it doesnt hold up This glamourized version just cant rise up to the 1937 production level I love Burt Bacharachs musical score that is if listend to by itself and I even bought a CD of it but for my taste it doesnt lend itself well to this mysterious and compelling story Just doesnt fit Michael York is lost here Sally Kellerman tosses off a fine performance but Olivia Hussy is just ridiculous and not worth lugging through the Himalayas The best performance is Charles Boyer as the head Lama
1,Perhaps I was just in a really good mood when I watched this film but for whatever reason I really liked this film Was it terribly original No Was it a bit predictable Yes And so what It was still a really nice movie Ive always liked Bruce Willis well almost always there was Hudson Hawk and The Fifth Element after all and he portrayed a selfish sarcastic bard perfectly Maybe this movie isnt Academy Award material but it sure is feel good material Go rent it
1,This movie was very cute and totally little girl appropriate My nieces have watched it nonstop since theyve gotten it and as a result Ive seen it nearly 4 times all the way through I cant get enough of it The CGI images are great to watch the humor is good and the ballet portrayals are excellent Although the story line has a few holes no little girl will pick up on them and as an adult the movie is so charming that one hardly even notices Just keep in mind that it is a Barbie movie and though cheesy at times in my experience this one lives up to the high standard which the other Barbie princess movies have set for it I would recommend this to anyone who has a little girl who has always wanted to be a princess It teaches a good lesson as well Everyone is special and different in their own way and everyone can make a difference
1,Nuovomondo was a great experience Many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue Emanuele Crialese directs his film very visually driven For everything he wants to tell he finds powerful images that are able to stand for themselves Thus he understands film as a medium that primarily tells its stories over the pictures on screen Particularly European cinema is often very dialoguedriven and many of the young USAmerican directors are strongly influenced by that Crialeses opposite attitude was really the point that made this film special for me It has also a very interesting topic that is wrapped up in a quite unusual story and told with humour Vincenzo Amato is outstanding as family head Salvatore as well as the amazing Charlotte Gainsbourg who I enjoy watching in every single one of her movies There are many great sequences in this movie Just to pick one When the ship leaves Italy and the people just quietly stare This scene is great particularly if you consider the pop cultural references that go with it Titanic
1,I was extremely amused to read some of the bad reviews on this movie First many have said that they have taken their 4 year old daughters and granddaughters to see this and they did not enjoy it First I dont believe that this is a kids movie at least not a movie for very very young children not 4 at least It has very subtle humor but it is not meant to offer quick amusement as seen in Tom and Jerry or something like this Many people have also complained that it goes very very slowlyI guess those people are all used to quantity over quality While I have a small quality problem myself with this movie and that is that the movie was not as detail oriented as the short movies I still believe that it managed quite well for a full feature film And how can people complain about the jokes The jokes were sensible timely and well thought out never rude insulting or in your face Wallace is extremely smart yet cautious and Grommit is the most adorable smart and cute character that could be This was a beautiful movie and the theme was very appropriatefor adults that isespecially with the increase of obesity and metabolic disease in the world theres nothing wrong with promoting vegetables and fruits for onceand this was accomplished in a very tasteful manner in that while people are concerned with the aspect of vegetables that doesnt necessarily mean that the are healthier or that they eat more of thembut just that they temper with nature which is in fact what caused the legend of the were rabbit to come true And for those out there that complained about the religious jokes I saycame on are you for real Many villages revolve around the local church and legendspremonitions etc are normal themes no harm done This movie was absolutely amazing yet some people had negative comments on it and I find this absolutely absurd
1,This TV series is about a foolish and unconventional English gentleman who gets up to all sorts of merry mishaps I remember watching Mr Bean with my family back in 1990 when I was still a child My family laughed so hard at every episode and the contents of which still come up in our daily conversations twenty years later The memorable scenes which are still in my head include Mr Bean attempting to get out of his car park shooting out the lights counting sheep and him in the swimming pool We bought all the Mr Bean videos on VHS no mater how expensive they were It was worth it because we watched them over and over again It is so rare to see a very funny TV series that is suitable for all ages
1,Continuing with the exclusive film programme about complicated relationships in some European courts last night in the Schloss theatre was shown Anna Boleyn a film directed by the great Teutonic film director Herr Ernst Lubitsch The film depicts the terrible story of the Queen consort of the British King Henry VIII She was executed by her husband  well not exactly the King ordered the executioners to do his dirty work not to mention that this marriage caused an important political and religious historical event the English Reformation The film stars Dame Henny Porten Germanys first screen superstar during those early years and Herr Emil Jannings Germanys fattest actor in that silent era Both play their characters in a suitable way Dame Porten as an innocent aristocrat who becomes progressively interested in the power that the court offers her and Herr Jannings as the unscrupulous whimsical and womanizing British monarch a character very suitable for this German actor who overacts appropriately given the extravagance and excessive personality of the character himself In the early film period Herr Lubitsch was known for his outstanding costume films colossal productions with big budgets  Anna Boleyn cost about 8 million marks a fortune even for this German count  taking great care in magnificent decors as can be seen during the coronation procession in Westminster Abbey scene which employed 4000 extras  idle Germans of that time were used causing revolutionary workers to create a fuss when German President Friedrich Ebert visited the set during filming Besides the spectacle one of the most important aspect of this and every film of Herr Lubitsch even during his epic period is the complex relationship between the main characters We experience a game of different interests double meanings and the complicated art of flirting but what is treated lightly at first ends in tragedy The importance of those historical facts is brought to bear in an effective way but Lubitsch is really more interested in the changing relationship between Henry VIII and Anna Boleyn And now if youll allow me I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must take care that one of his fat and rich heiress doesnt lose her head for this Teutonic aristocrat Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien httpferdinandvongalitzienblogspotcom
1,For those who expect documentaries to be objective creatures let me give you a little lesson in American filmmaking Documentaries rely heavily on casting You pick and choose characters you think will enhance the drama and entertainment value of your film After you have shot a ton of footage you splice it together to make a film with ups and downs turning points climaxes etc If you have trouble with existing footage you either shoot some more that makes sense find some stock footage or be clever with your narration The allegation that the filmmakers used footage of locales not part of the movie favelas next to beautiful beaches does not detract from the value of the film as a dramatic piece and the particular image is one that resonates enough to justify its notquitetruthful inclusion At any rate you use the footage you can So they didnt happen to have police violence footage for that particular neighborhood Does this mean not include it and just talk about it or maybe put in some cartoon animation so the audience isnt duped Um no As for the hopeful ending why not Yes Americans made it Yes Americans are optimistic bastards But why end on a down note Just because its set in a foreign country and foreign films by and large end on a down note Let foreigners portray the dismal outlook of life Let us Americans think there may be a happy ending looming in the future There just may be one
1,Simply one of the best movies ever If you wont get it  sorry for you I believe that someday people will include this one in their alltime top 10s Not now but in the far future
1,Recovery is a welljudged and balanced drama of a sensitive subject that doesnt sentimentalise the main characters David Tennant and Sarah Parish bring to the fore the complex and conflicting emotions of a couple deeply in love struggling to come to terms with the personality changes they both endure and also must make to survive a tragic accident Tennant as Alan brings humour as well as a dangerous lecherousness as an engineer recovering from a memory loss brought on by a road accident Alan is not portrayed simply as a victim but as human being with feelings doing the best he can to make sense of his new life Sarah Parishs Tricia is not a clichéd standbyherman housewife who will do anything to support her husband She struggles with falling out of love with Alan as the man she once new and loved is now a completely different person  a stranger to her Contrary to some opinion this  in my view  makes perfect Sunday night viewing Too often we are shown soft family dramas or detective series like Heartbeat which rot and putrefy the brain Programme commissioners seem to think that the traditional day of rest is also a day when our minds go to sleep More challenging and thoughtprovoking drama like Recovery would seriously change the situation
1,I had actually considered investing in this movie when Gorman was out drumming up funding I loved most of the script but did not like the ending Gorman insisted the ending was as it had to be Seeing the completed movie I have to say I am amazed Reading the script I had not imagined the acting and Gormans directing would be as powerful and moving as it is here The two leads did an amazing job They were very believable and this movie is well worth watching just for the performances of these two amazing stars Now for the spoiler and if you have not seen the movie please dont read further as you need to see the movie first I actually wish I had never read the script just so I could have experienced the movie ending first hand   SPOILER  I have two main problems with the movie First off and Im sure I mentioned this when I read the script the wife should have died If she were dead the ending would be much more believable As it is we have this guy who has been agonizing over a woman who left him years ago If she left him and he is still in love after so long hed have to be seriously delusional But he doesnt come across that way in the script There is also the problem of why he did not expend all this energy going after the wife he still loves Plus if the wife were dead we would actually be able to believe that they had a fulfilling reciprocating love and therefore believe that the guy is devastated enough for the ending to be reasonable However I dont buy Daphne doing what she does in the ending Id need a heck of a lot of convincing to believe that this naive girl very naive for a whore but believable due to Bohls performance did what she did The character is simply not cold enough And if she did this out of some kind of love or something else then there is a whole piece of the moviestory missing Much of this movie is reminiscent of Sex Lies and Video Tape I think it could have been as popular if Gorman had chosen to give the movie a more believable ending  So watch the movie enjoy the performance And make up your own mind
1,Now this is more like itOne of the best movies I have ever seenDespite it made very well on all aspectsthis movie was put down solely for not being too historically accurateLoosen upThere are tons of historical movies out there that were forgiven for not being too historically accurate and many of them do not even come close to how grandhow entertaining and how captivating this movie wasNow this is what a movie ticket is all aboutYou will get exacty what you want from this movies genre and all naysayers are those with the antiFlynn syndromeThis conservative rooted syndrome is very closely related to the antiElvisantiAliantiClintonantiKennedy syndromesusually caused by fear of charming individuals who have unconventional beliefsIf the viewer of this movie is open minded and has the ability to separate politics from artyou will find this movie not only one of the best classicsbut also one of the best movies of all timeI rate it the second best western ever right behind Waynes The Cowboys
1,The intricate plot great visuals the worlds greatest car chase ever make this movie a lot of fun to watch The beautiful Charlize Theron adds to the enjoyment The sound score is outstanding Add to all this an energetic cast that also seems to be having a lot of fun making the movie
1,I just finished watching Following and I thought it was great I rated it 8 out of 10 I plan on watching it again with the directors commentary and then again in chronological order I rented this movie because of my fascination of Christopher Nolans more recent movie Memento Following has some similarities this movie was probably the blueprint for Memento Even the music in some parts is very similar Shooting the movie in black and white gives it a mysterious feel The story and dialogue is really good The performance of the actors is believable Christopher Nolan made this movie on a really low budget I look forward to his next release Insomnia a big budget movie with my favourite actor Al Pacino
1,This may actually the finest film of 1999 No Im not kidding This documentary directed by Chris Smith captures the very spirit of artistic compulsion Smith does the smart thing any documentary filmaker should do he keeps invisible and refuses to judge his subject  As the viewer watches Mark and his efforts no matter how funkily aggressive they may prove to finish his films He refuses to compromise and suffers repeatedly as a result But lest we forget remember Speilberg Scorsese and others started just as humbly And what a great subject he chooses Mark his family and friends are all fascinating characters far more than any character created in last years fictitious cinematic productsThis film oscillates on the dime between comedy tragedy touching sympathy and leads us ultimately to inspiring any viewer with an urge to create despite talent issues to get off their butts and make something The film is about maverick artists and their passions It is also about families no matter how codependent and disfunctional they may be and how unique and beautiful that organism truly is Mark proves in the film to be utterly devoted not only to his dreams but also to his family as well and they to him  Why this film was not nominated for documentary of the year is beyond me and criminal that is assuming it was eligible last year This film is to be sought out and treasured
1,I first saw APOCALYPSE NOW in 1985 when it was broadcast on British television for the first time  I was shell shocked after seeing this masterpiece and despite some close competition from the likes of FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING this movie still remains my all time favourite nearly 20 years after I first saw it  This leads to the problem of how I can even begin to comment on the movie  I could praise the technical aspects especially the sound  editing and cinematography but everyone else seems to have praised  Rightly too  these achievements to high heaven while the performances in general and Robert Duvall in particular have also been noted  and everyone else has mentioned the stark imagery of the Dou Long bridge and the montage of the boat traveling upriver after passing through the border  How about the script  Francis Ford Coppola is best known as a director but hes everyway a genius as a screenwriter as he was as a director  I said  was  in the past tense because making this movie seems to have burned out every creative brain cell in his head  but his sacrifice was worth it  In John Milius original solo draft we have a script thats just as insane and disturbing as the one on screen  but Coppolas involvement in the screenplay has injected a narrative that exactly mirrors that of war  Check how the screenplay starts off all jingoistic and macho with a star turn by Bill Kilgore who wouldnt have looked out of place in THE GREEN BERETS but the more the story progresses the more shocking and insane everything becomes  so much so that by the time reaches Kurtz outpost the audience are watching another film in much the same way as the characters have sailed into another dimension  When Coppola states  This movie isnt about Vietnam  It is Vietnam  hes right  What started off as a patriotic war to defeat communist aggression in the mid 1960s had by the films setting  The Manson trial suggests its 1970  had changed Americas view of both the world and itself and of the worlds view of America  Its the insane beauty of APOCALYPSE NOW that makes it a masterwork of cinema and says more in its running time about the brutality of conflict and the hypocrisy of politicians  What did you do in the Vietnam War Mr President   than Michael Moore could hope to say in a lifetime  Ive not seen the REDUX version but watching the original print I didnt feel there was anything missing from the story which like all truly great films is very basic  In fact the premise can lend itself to many other genres like a western where an army officer has to track down and kill a renegade colonel whos leading an injun war party  or a scifi movie where a UN assassin is to eliminate a fellow UN soldier whos leading a resistance movement on Mars  though this is probably down to Joseph Conrads original source novel My all time favourite movie and its very fitting that I chose this movie to be my one thousandth review at the IMDb
1,Okay I know thats cliché Taken on its surface this is a bad film perhaps in a league with Plan 9 From Outer Space The dialog is suspect but the Singlish is quite enjoyable the plot is not quite believable Gavins character overacts excessively While watching the movie somethings happen that truly make you wonder Handsome and Kim making out on a tank Gwen eating a banana in a bath just about everything Gavin says and does psssssssssssssssycho These things taken separately are perhaps flaws Taken together however they are merely quirks Watching this movie with an openmind especially if youre not familiar with Singaporean culture and with an openminded group of friends is guaranteed to deliver a lot of laughs and a memorable time You cant go into this movie expecting a masterpiece or even expecting to take anything serious at all If you can take this film for what it is  an underdog film about underdogs filled to the brim with its own quirks  then you should have a good time watching this one Ive already seen it three times and I wouldnt hesitate to watch it three more times
1,I watched this movie in 75 and this movie was a kind of open mind to me about how important is to care the Natur and the Wild life When i got a Dog in 83 i called him TRUSKA  In MovieAvakuns dog  to never forget this movie  By the way i HAVE a Copy this Movie but is in Portuguese Language and the quality is not so good like a DVD or a New VHS  i recorded almost 20 years ago and in SLP speedy so the quality is not so good If somebody wish a Copy ill try convert to DVD and i can send for you OK Ots a great movie and i agree that is a movie to be always watched Waldemar Braz  Sao PauloBrazil
1,I have seen this film probably a dozen times since it was originally released theatrically Anyone who calls this movie trash or horrible just doesnt understand action films or recognize a good one Perhaps to some the incidents and outcomes may seem far fetched but in my opinion screenwriter Shane Black  Lethal Weapon Kiss Kiss Bang Bang crafted one of the most well thought out action adventures you will ever come across Over the top or not this film flows like clockwork and the action just keeps coming The final action sequence is one of the best I have ever seen in any film The cast in this film crackles Genna Davis gave a tremendous performance and its a damn shame there was never a LKG sequel Samuel L Jackson is hilarious as her sidekick Mitch a down on his luck private eye trying to help her discover her lost past and make a few bucks If Baffles me how anyone could not like this film It packs so many thrills and its so funny The wisecracks in this film still make me laugh just as hard 10 years later In my mind the first Matrix film and the Long Kiss Goodnight were easily 2 of the best and most original action flicks of the 90s Incidentally Shane Black made a fortune when he sold this script At the time it was the highest selling screenplay and its worth every penny Its so sad that audiences never gave this movie a chance cause they would have witnessed Renny Harlins best film and Genna Davis like you have never seen her before Long live The Long Kiss Goodnight
1,Ive enjoyed this movie ever since I first saw it in the theatre Some movies have a cast of characters and a script that come together in perfect synergy and this is one of them The characters illustrate some truths about getting the best out of people working together harmoniously building a team and achieving goals without ever preaching morality The situations are crafted well and are consistent with the movies opening premise The tension builds nicely and the humor is clean and consistent throughout The movie manages to pull me right in to root for the characters and to laugh pretty well all the way through This is a feel good movie as good as they come What amazes me is that a movie which appears so simple can be so long term entertaining The music is a perfect copy of music in the typical serious post war navy movies which helps to create the humor and point out that greatness is in the eye of the beholder The scenes in the credits are a great music video of In the Navy which deserve their own full screen special feature The scenes and cuts are crafted well and the casting and acting is right on This movie is a classic as great as any ever made without any pretensions In fact the lack of pretension is what makes it so much fun to watch I love these guys and gal The other day I thought of the film and wondered whether it was available on DVD Good fortune has come to us and the DVD came out in May 2004 I headed to the store and snapped up a copy Then my wife and I enjoyed another hilarious night in front of the big screen Ive rated this movie as a 10 because it comes together on all levels far better than many high budget films and Oscar winners This is entertainment Listen up Fox home video you have a great movie in your vaults and its a shame to find a cheap shot DVD with badly degraded off tint colors only 8 years since release So why not restore the colors and present the film as it was meant to be seen Id gladly pay a few bucks more to get the picture right Im grateful to have my own copy Now give us the eye candy that the film deserves and how about recreating the credit sequence as a full screen music video special feature
1,Charles Chaplins Shoulder Arms of 1918 was his longest film to date though at just over 45 minutes in length it was not quite a feature film With World War One just drawing to a close many popular entertainers of the time were doing their part to inspire their native troops and Chaplin was no exception And so the lovable Tramp went to war The film begins with the Tramp in training and the character is hilariously inept at even the simplest military drills including marching and gunslinging much to the disgust of his drill sergeant The Tramp then finds himself in the trenches faced with a more formidable foe though the Germans eventually turn out of be infinitely more incompetent than even he The uproarious moment when the Tramp declares that he singlehandedly captured thirteen German soldiers by surrounding them had me in stitches There are plenty of other great moments in this film Chaplin awaking to find his sleeping barracks underwater and being unable to literally find his own feet is hilarious as is his ingenious use of a tube from a record player to sleep beneath the surface However the most memorable scenes in the film undoubtedly involve Chaplin skulking behind enemy lines disguised as a tree The reactions of the bumbling German soldiers unknowingly just metres from a sworn enemy as they are singlehandedly disabled onebyone are highly amusing especially when one soldier grapples an axe with the intention of cutting down a tree for firewood This is a very enjoyable film and one of the best of Chaplins pre1920 efforts Highly recommended
1,I saw this on Zone horror and fully expected it to be compete crap like most of the films they play  however I was pleasantly surprised The film revolves around 2 friends and a maniac in a monster truck who is chasing them i know it sounds crap but its actually quite good  the film is creepy when it intends to be and is laugh out loud funny in parts and not in an unintentional way either it is well paced and is a lot of fun as well as being very gory  theres some very funny black humour thrown in as well Its not the most original movie but so what If your after Shakespeare then this is not it  if your after a fun movie then this should be fine
1,Playwright John Osbornes Look Back in Anger The Entertainer dramatisation of Oscar Wildes only novel positively revels in the homosexual subtext of the original perhaps too much so Nonetheless the dialogue the acting with a cast headed by Sir John Gielgud  Jeremy Brett and the brilliantly cerebral production marred only by a too quick ending make this worth the while of any lover of Theater with a capital T
1,Who won the best actress Oscar for 1933 It should have been Laura Hope Crewes for her magnificent portrayal of the most monstrous mother ever She truly is one of the great character actresses of all time She played the frivolous Prudence Duvernoy in Camille 1936 and her best remembered role is Aunt Pittypat in Gone With the Wind Irene Dunne was the official star of the film but her scenes with Laura Hope Crewes were dynamite David Joel McCrea is in Heidelberg when he is offered a job in New York His wife Christine Irene Dunne can continue her studies at the Rockafellar Centre Their first stop in America is a visit to Davids mother Mrs Phelps To say that Laura Hope Crewes dominates every scene is an understatement From her first entrance  in a frantic burst of effort to greet her big boy  all attention is on her Even sitting around the tea table when she forgets Hesters existence even forgetting how she takes her tea you know something is not quite rightHester has been living there for a while Frances Dee is completely sweet and so right in her role as the adorable Hester Her performance in this film especially the scene where she has hysterics and the aftermath proves how underrated as an actress she was All the young cast are excellent Eric Linden is superb as Robert the younger son who comes to the realization that his mother is horrible but can do nothing about escaping from his mothers spell Joel McCrea at one point says painting roses on bathtubs  thats more your style There is a very subtle suggestion in the film of Roberts sexuality Irene Dunne is excellent in whatever film or genre she tried
1,Fun mix of vampires and martial arts is a bit of a mess plotwise and the acting of those who dubbed the voices is almost universally bad but the premise is engaging the fight scenes are fast and flashy and the movie is often quite amusing Its a shame the story is such a wreck There are a couple of places where I had no idea what just happened it was almost as though five minutes had just been cut out and you were suddenly at the next scene without knowing how youd got there The movie is poor at explaining things and some things dont make a lot of sense but the movie moves along breezily so its flaws barely register Not a great movie by any means but definitely a fun one
1,Water 2005 the final part of Torontobased Indian filmdirector Deepa Mehtas elemental trilogy has been finally completed almost ten years after the release of the very first controversial element Fire 1996 which was followed with a slightly lesser controversial sequel 1947 Earth 1998 Mehta made her directorial debut with a 24minute Canadian short film At 99 A Portrait of Louise Tandy Murch 1975 but it was her Canadian feature film about the life of Indians living in Canada that brought her fame back in east her country by birthright Sam  Me 1991 Recognition internationally came in the way of Camilla 1994 starring Bridget Fonda along with the actress who in 1990 won an Oscar in Best Actress in a Leading Role category at the age of 80 paving the way for middleaged actresses to still have hope for her portrayal of a stubborn old Jewish woman in Driving Miss Daisy 1989 late Jessica Tandy  Camilla dealt with a friendship between two women from two other ends of the human lifespan a MayDecember friendship Camilla was Tandys last picture she died the very same year International fame followed Deepa Mehta in 1996 with the release of the controversial Fire which spread with rage among the false patriotic consciousness existing Indian extremist Having already explored friendship between two women in Camilla in Fire Mehta went a step further to portray a more intimate relationship between two lonely neglected women Set in modern day India the suburbs of the capital city of New Delhi it shows two brothers and their wives the elder brother Kulbhushan Kharbanda having joined a weird Hindu sect leads a life of celibacy faithful to his guru of sexless existence The younger brother Javed Jaffrey is having an extra marital affair with a Chinese woman Alice Poon Thus both the wives Shabana Azmi playing the elder brothers wife and Nandita Das the younger wife find themselves neglected in their own way One forced to lead a celibate life thanks to her husbands eccentricities and the other whose only interaction with her husband is through sex and nothing more Living in a world of inlaws and being the only two outsiders in the family having nobody else to confide in the two women fall in the arms of each other Thus comes the issue of lesbianism If there were an outside mans shoulder to cry on there most probably would have been chance for them to fall into the arms of a man but having no one else to confide in their need for each others support is quite obvious It does not necessarily state that all neglected women would end up taking lesbianism it just happened to exist with regard to the two women in this context All in all the movie is excellent and delves far deeper than just two women rolling in bed The key focus isnt lesbianism in the movie but the plight of modern day neglected Indian wives even in the capital city the two female characters just happen to have a sexual relationship  Two years later Deepa Mehtas second installment was the element of mother earth released in India by the name of 1947 Earthyet another excellent movie by a great director this time in the Hindi language unlike Fire which was made in the English language  Now Deepa Mehta has managed to complete the trilogy despite a lot of problems having released the final installment recently Water No doubt it would be just as great as the other two

1,Spoiler Alert  I have never seen comments on a movie that I disagree with more then the comments people made on this One could learn from critical viewings of this movie As an educational film I rate it highly because it teaches how to succeed We do not watch movies to learn we generally watch for entertainment As entertainment I rate it low the ending is downbeat and cerebralintellectual This conflict results in my eight star rating The movie follows Jane Craig Holly Hunter a television news producer The network executive introduces Tom Grunnick William Hurt to study for the on air news anchor position Tom immediately charms people with humbleness Another potential news anchor has been waiting for years for his on air opportunity Aaron Altman Albert Brooks Altman knows all news stories inside and out The Network executive wants Grunnick on the air and Jane argues saying Grunnick is not ready he doesnt know the news They do not listen to her Forced to place Grunnick on the air Jane contacts Altman to get information on the news story and relays Altmans comments through an earpiece to Grunnick while Grunnick speaks We watch the sharp contrast between AltmansJane Craigs words and Grunnicks as Grunnick skillfully rewords everything Altman and Jane Craig say in his ear in order to make it understandable likable and entertaining the audience Altman gets a chance on air and the network execs require him to seek coaching from Grunnick the new guy This new news ingnorant guy coaching him This is something Altman does not see justified but agrees reluctantly  Grunnick coaches Altman and gets excited noting hundreds of Altmans shortcomings in appearance audio and vocabulary Altman never considered these things before when he became an expert on the news itself The complexity of understanding what Grunnick taught him causes Altman to have a panicked sweating attack Flop Sweat when he is on the air Grunnick eventually becomes the top network anchor and Altman resigns prior to being fired But Grunnick fails in his attempt for a romance with Jane Craig because she finds out from Altman that Grunnick sometimes fakes circumstances in order to make people like him This turns her off of him This sends the message that in relationships we want people who are genuine and not trying to make us like them  This movie sends the message that getting people to like you is the most important skill in a job but it is especially true in Broadcast News There are many people commenting on how this is the dumbing down of TV News and how Grunnick represents a good looking but dumb guy or all style but no substance The opposite is true Grunnick possessed skills and very complex intellect to get people to like him including the presence of mind to know exactly how he appears and sounds when he is on camera He coaches Altman to Punch a word in every sentence Grunnicks flaw that costs him the relationship with Jane Craig is that he is too driven to be likable and will fake a situation Many people are calling Altman very intelligent or brilliant Altman played by Brookes is not as intelligent as Grunnick and the Flop Sweat scene shows that his mind could not handle the complexity that Grunnick handles when on the air Altman is angered by this fact that he knew the news and Grunnick suceeded more by getting people to like him There are also people commenting that these things are exclusive to the TV News industry The concept that winning friends is the most important skill in a job is obviously not popular but my experience indicates it is true in most jobs As an education on how to succeed this movie is fantastic albeit unpopular Educational yes but it does not have an uplifting ending
1,Stripperella is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones voiced by Pamela Anderson who lives a double life as a stripper at a gentlemans club known as The Tender Loins and as a sexy crimefighter known as Stripperella aka Agent 69 who works for a government organization As Stripperella Erotica fights crime and the forces of evil such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or make them fat and Cheapo a criminal who steals from 99 cent stores and makes his two henchmen share a gun The creator of the character and the series is Stan Lee of Marvel fame and creator of SpiderMan Back in late June of 2003 Spike TV then known as The New TNN premiered a Thursday night block of three animated shows Those shows were Ren  Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon new adventures of classic kids show characters Ren and Stimpy for adults done by original creator John Kricfalusi Gary the Rat about a lawyer who is turned into a human sized rat starring Kelsee Grammar of Cheers and Fraiser fame and Stripperella the adventures of a stripper who doubles as a superhero voiced by Pamela Anderson and created by Stan Lee I remember seeing all three of the premiers I was anxious to see Ren and Stimpy as I love the original show I was a little let down It was alright but it seemed to take things a little too far seeing the two have gay sex together was a bit much Though Gary the Rat wasnt bad the best of the three was easily Stripperella The animation was really good it had an awesome intro song it had some good talent behind it and it was funny as hell The show was just so silly I dont even know how to begin explaining it After four of five weeks if not a little less the animation block disappeared which was weird because I know it got good ratings and it was advertised everywhere I was disappointed to see Stripperella go but several months later I found out about new episodes that aired at like 100 AM I only got to see one and though it was funny as hell and I was glad to see the show back after all that time something seemed a bit off In the beginning of its short run Stripperella had great animation It was dark moody realistic and somewhat sexy too The Stripperella costumed looked good too the character was drawn well After the long hiatus and during the rest of the episodes the animation was very different Instead of dark and realistic look it originally had everything was now really colorful and cartoonish Stripperella received the biggest changes though Before she had normal long hair now she had hair bigger than Peggy Bundys Married with Children if even possible Also the eye mask actually shows her eyes now before it was just white you saw which was cool since it was more superheroish Also the upper part of her costume was kind of a vesttype thing with a collar and her costume was dark blue that changed to her costume being a bluishviolet color and her upper costume being really crappy looking in comparison In short the show was a cartoon and very over the top silly beforehand but the secondhalf it became more cartoonish looking and though still laughoutloud hilarious it became more zany as well for example there was a later episode about a werebeaveryes a werebeaver  Anyway instead of complaining about the midseries changes Stripperella only ran one season but it was a very good show Like the Tales from the Crypt film Bordello of Blood it may be really campy but its really fun As long as your not a prude youll find yourself laughing repeatedly at this show I havent seen every episode because I havent got the DVD yet for two reasons 1 Paramount released and they have this screwed up policy about not including any extras on nearly all released TV shows even though this was the entire show I would have liked to see some commentarys maby explaining the animation change and interviews with Pamela Anderson and Stan Lee and 2 the awesome Kid Rock song during the opening was replaced Now Im not a fan of his but that intro sang WAS the theme for the show If your not going to pay to have any extras at least pay to have the original intro song you jackasses The show also had a few interesting guest stars such as John Lovitz as Cheapo and Mark Hamil as the plastic surgion who hates models Also Tom Kenny SpongeBob was on the show as the owner of the strip club in most every episode Stan Lee has a cameo in one episode too The Breakdown  PROS Had a great look to it at first FUNNY AS HELL a very fun show great voice talent for the most part Chief Strogenoff watch the show and see some of the stuff he does and was easily the best of the three animated shows mentioned earlier CONS The midseries animation change and the crappy DVD described earlier Aside from the fact that some of the humor could be kind of dumb at times I have nothing really negative to say about this OVERALL Stripperella is a huge guilty pleasure of mine and its a shame it only ran one season It was a very funny sexy actioned packed cult series that I hope to see air on Adult Swim someday with the original intro intact and possibly give it another season like Family Guy Check it out even if it is on the lousy DVD You will laugh yourself silly Rated TVMA Crude and Sexual Humor and Nudity Runtime About 25 minutes per episode Score 910
1,The gimmick as it were of this 1934 Paramount comedy is the six comedy performers paired off into three manandwoman teams who all appear together W C Fields and his frequent screen partner Alsion Skipworth appear in the second half of the film and shine in their roles as a smalltown sheriff and innkeeper Fields seems to have been given the latitude to inject plenty of his own oneofakind brand of misanthropic surreal comedy into his part and it works wonderfully especially where he is allowed to do his famous pool table routine a digression that is totally welcome since it is hilarious At first thought it might have seemed like a mismatch to conceive of a film to be carried by the subtle domestic comedy of Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland next to the broad jokey Vaudeville patter of the great husbandandwife comedy team of George Burns and Gracie Allen but here it works perfectly because of the parts George and Gracie are given in the script They are there are freeloaders hitching a ride to California on Ruggles and Bolands honeymoon trip and consistently find ways to annoy them at every step including brilliantly while they are each holding on to the side of a cliff for dear life Making Burns and Allen comic annoyances to two sympathetic characters turns out to be a perfect way to fit their farout largerthanlife comedy characters into a real world setting  the comedy of people reacting to them in a believable way turns out to be as much as a goldmine as Gracies famous naive delivery itself Charlie Ruggles deserves special mention for his performance as the fussy banker Pinky Whinney Hes marvelously subtle and underplayed and draws laughs from lines that in another actors hands might not even have been heard The script is wonderfully witty all through and most of the way its a perfectly extended comedy of frustration in which our sympathies are with the poor Whinneys who cant get a moment alone and the extra bonus is that what frustrates them is just more firstrate comedy material from Burns and Allen  For the precode watchers out there there is some rather suggestive material in some of the most amusing scenes as Whinney tries to get across to George just WHY he and his wife want to be alone for a while There are a few signs of a rushed production here  the occasional jump cut one of the most obvious drop sets you will ever see in a movie right up there with W C Fields own short The Golf Specialist and the knot in Fields tie is constantly changing in shape These dont bother me though and they shouldnt bother anybody who is enjoying the film Six of a Kind is a real littleknown gem and one of the funniest movies Ive seen in a while If youre thinking about whether to watch it the answer should be yes
1,Talking about competition features at the Split Film festival we have titles from all over the world China Korea Canada USA and Australia and many of these stories are indicating that the world is really valley of tears Modern lovethats for sure  In that movie by Alex Frayne two younger married people and their boy are traveling from town to the coast to visit the grave and house of the mans uncle who raised him a long time ago and who died in mysterious circumstances The coastal village seems like something in an American horror film where the village is bizarre and people are uncommon mutants But episodes in Alex Fraynes pastorella cant be described as horror in the normal way In fact this is an extreme interesting drama where we are seeing relationships and horror through flashbacks and much more In this story and through obviously psychological facets of the actors we are shown a peep show of film some charmingly eccentric Australian filmmaking Thus is the the case of Frayne Always something new and fresh Visual intelligence and unique sensibility of some Australian directors is astonishing good Fraynes movie is super There is something in the Australian landscape that shows their movies so special as we have see in FRAYNEs Modern Love and in RAY Lawrence movies Lantana and Jindabyne It seems it will be the same in future titles of Alex Frayne
1,I kid you not Yes Whos That Girl has the distinction for being one in a string of Madonnas films that bombed but I actually liked this movie more than Desperately Seeking Susan In Susan Madonnas character is relegated to being secondfiddle to Rosanna Arquette and is not given much to work with No disrespect to Rosanna but in WTG Madonna plays this zany outrageous character only done in an 80s style While it may seem cheesy today this is actually one of Madonnas best and one of her most underrated films Madonna plays Nikki Finn an excon who is sent to the slammer for a crime she didnt commit Shes being released from jail after four years of good behavior Griffin Dunne who is also a very underrated actor plays Louden Trott a lawyer who has the unpleasant task of picking her up from jail to take her to the bus station Of course when these two get together thats when the madness happens Sir John Mills has a small role as the rich businessman who has a huge mansion in the middle of Manhattan with a rainforest on his roof  This movie parodies everything Rich people the sleazy characters who live in Harlem and totally destroy Loudens RollsRoyce the gay cops who follow Madonna and Dunne around town and Dunnes stuckup fiance Wendy Worthington who has purportedly slept with every cab driver in New York City played by Haviland Morris who was Jakes girlfriend Caroline in Sixteen Candles Hilarious Plus Dunne is also in charge of a rare breed of leopard reminiscent of Bringing Up Baby Plus Madonna had a great platinum blonde 80s look back in those days and the movie has a great soundtrack Throw this all into the mix and you have the zaniness of WTG Madonna is the queen of deadpan acting There are times in the movie where she says a line totally straight and surprisingly it turns out to be funny Thats how some of the best comedy should be played  straight Madonna should have done more comedy and it was a shame that she did not choose to do so Later on she became much more controversial and got into more of the dark sexuallycharged roles in the notorious movies Body of Evidence and Dangerous Game  Some people say Madonna cannot act and that is fine people are entitled to their opinion but I believe the real problem is that people cannot see the difference between Madonna playing a character on film instead they still see only Madonna and that is main reason why she is given more respect for her music than for her movies Its still a fun screwball comedy of the 80s Not for everyone Im sure some of you will dislike it so I would recommend it mainly for Madonna fans but you never know you might be surprised and like it  Interesting note One of Madonnas friends from her early80s New York club days Coati Mundi who plays Raoul was a member in the bands Kid Creole and The Coconuts and Savannah Band
1,This is one great sweeping movie you will remember for a long time It is about history America the change of times Teddy Roosevelt Morocco a kidnapped American and her children and the leader of the Berbers with the blood of the Prophet in his veins This movie is based on a true storylike Jesse James was a banker An American WAS kidnapped in Morocco and the Marines went partway to the shores of Tripoli to rescue him So much for that You know Hollywood Sean Connery is the Berber chieftain and Muslim leader Candice Bergan is the guy who was kidnapped along with her two kids the son is Rex Harrisons grandson Simon no less John Huston is Secretary of State with a great JohnHustonstyle straight line at a State Dinner watch out for it Brian Kieth IS Teddy Roosevelt allAmerican allmale a character that is an interesting commentary as modern as today The sweep and beauty of the desert and Morocco are shown beautifully in the cinematography in this film which will stay with you a haunting and compelling memory The score is as sweeping and exotic as the images This is a story about two cultures both with grand ideas and historic pasts struggling for the future without an idea at all about one another In any event the struggle comes down to might versus ingenuity Then at the last there is the little boyremember the little boy What do you think HE thinks
1,Beautifulthat one word pretty much sums up this whole film Everything from the cinematography the directing the actingbrilliant At any point of the film you can pause it and you will no doubt be looking at something mosaic or artsy fartsy as some people would say I assure you that after one viewing Bobbycrush will be stuck in your head I know this from first hand experience Even the soundtrack is great It goes together very well with the tone and pace of the film Be thankful that Cam Archer exists in this world We need more people like him to make films that show love and shame in totally real and surreal imagery
1,This Film is the One which you fall in love with Alfred Hitchcock shall always remain over the top of any directors of his time The most influential aspects about his films are sheer Simplicity  Gripping Drama The another best thing about Hitchcocks films is a Definite  Gripping End Any thing said about The Man who knew too much is less The Cinematography Acting Dialogs  Camera Works are magnificent in this Movie The Song Que Sera Sera at the end shall remain in our memories for life time The film is so enjoyable from start to end that we never know when it ends Rarely would Hitchcock include humor in his films this film has comic scenes which fits in to the movie  This film is absolutely brilliant  as good as Vertigo
1,I must admit when I first began watching this film I had no clue what was going on So the beginning was a bit confusing for me However that did not diminish my enjoyment of the movie The characters reveal themselves to be more complex than they may first appear and that is what makes this a memorable film At first I heard this was a real Hollywood movie Although it obviously lacks the stereotypical guns and fists element the convincing performances of talented actors such as Martin Sheen and Sam Neill more than make up for it Id rather see a film with more substance than shooting any day
1, Spoilers Spoilers Spoilersjust a few small ones  Saw this on Satilite channel missed the first 30 min of movie will keep this comment short and informative The movie is basically about 5 charactersThe acting is very bad for afew characters 1 girl with the help of another girl kidnaps 3 different people but it backfires and the 3 kidnap the 2 This is one of those types of movies where the script writers try to be thought provoking or philosophical mysterious and  you get the point but do to their own personal lack in thinking they fall terribly short Like one of the captives who is supposed to be some type of psychology nerd  looks the part but his tongue cant speak it THe writers think that if the nerd uses a lot of 8 letter words amateurishly  unknowingly i believe  that the viewers will be ignorant enough to believe it I wish i could give an example but i cant recall any  exactly as it was said The ending was bad as well But the one female captive acted her role as an old and relatively wise lady although she as well as the rest had a lot of cliché s So Why would i give this movie a 7 stars if I thought all the above Simple I give the entire seven stars to LISA KELLER  one sexy a momma SHE is FINE lol I am an appreciator of beauty and she is exactly that But dont get me confused because Im not a pervert and this movie is NOT a porno in any way their is somethin about her I cant explain but i like it I remember the scene where a captive has broke free and as he looks for a way out bumps into Keller She tries to get way but she doesnt have a chance He throws her down kneeling on the stairs and he pulls her pants down no panties  Now although she has an AMAZING ass  and the this shot leaves little to the imagination for a long 30 seconds i think  it was her facial expression that got me she wanted it and that look had me thinking i was behind that I would have torn that booty up After that expression i jus couldnt look at her objectively anymore I WAS IN LOVE lol I am glad to have seen this movie but if Lisa Keller wasnt playing the lead role I would have changed the channel well after i had seen the scene i mentioned above I am a LISA KELLER fan know but is seems that she isnt a consistent actor seeing this 2003 movie is her latest But i am lookin forward to another movie with her in it
1,This is a sort of hidden gem It has little to no promotion no fanfare no classic status and it deserves all of the above One of the great directors of cinema Fritz Lang has created a real gem in this excellent western A fine cast led by Randolph Scott in probably one of his greatest performances the always sturdy Dean Jagger Robert Young as a surprisingly accomplished dude plus many veteran character actors Chill Wills Slim Summerville John Carradine Barton MacLane and others in an exciting Zane Grey story of the laying of the Western Union cable across country It has tense drama sprinklings of humor and great effects Its reminiscent of DeMille in ways and yet Fritz Lang leaves his own stamp on it At very least this is a damned good western
1,I was expecting this movie to be a stinker but I wanted to see for myself but I was surprised how good of a movie this was I know longer movies often dont do well at the box office but why this was pulled and not allowed to be viewed by the public is beyond me It maintained my interest throughout and the scenery and photography is breathtaking at times The plot was good and the morality play was a good one I liked the realism which was along the lines of Unforgiven I had to rent this movie to see it but it was definitely worth it
1,I have to admit I have a particular penchant for the humor and story telling style of British movies though not all of course succeed This film made me think and left me in the end with a quiet smile on my face Its about character development and relationships truth and lies and whether love is sometimes simply not enough Some very nicely understated acting from all the participants especially the two leads Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson There was a lot of fuss made about Gosford Park but with this piece I feel Fellowes has actually produced a better movie though it has not been a mainstream release An intelligent mature story about real people who are undeniably flawed but also capable of acts of genuine graciousness
1,Its a movie with a theatrical message blended with some clever moments Films like these are the stretching grounds of great actors they enjoy tossing the ball in open pieces like these The Angel that wasnt what we see in old books and churches is quite a nice change It is echoed in Kevin Smiths piece Dogma almost in the same slapstick vein 0 Watch this film for a good day after you suck it all in Could it be that so many films are trying to be complicated that we forget the simple movements of films like this Possibly one of the most fun pieces I have seen in a while I ran into this one on VHS in a trash can because someones basement was flooded this summer and I grabbed a handful of tapes Whether in a trash bin or on the silver screen mild comedies like this are fun you just dont have to tell everyone at a hip nightclub that you like it or a swank political party Just keep it for yourself and Ill bet plenty of people will borrow it from time to time
1,several years ago i saw this film without subtitles on television and despite me not understanding a word of what the characters were saying i still got the general idea and the mood of the film fascinated me no ends at long last i saw it again a few weeks ago my heart skipped when i saw the picture in the television guide and for 8 days until the film was really shown i told everybody i knew to go and see it the story reminded me a bit of alfred hitchcocks vertigo a slow brooding film about a guy who one day believes he sees the girlfriend that disappeared years before what follows is a wild rollercoaster ride of flashbacks changing perspectives and really inventive twists in the plot and at the end of the film i was left breathless i had definitely not got what i had expected and i had actually already seen the film be prepared to be confused 9 out of 10

1,In many ways the filmic career of independent filmmaking legend John Cassavetes is the polar opposite of someone like Alfred Hitchcock the consummate studio director Where Hitchcock infamously treated his actors as cattle Cassavetes sought to work with them improvisationally Where every element in a Hitchcock shot is composed immaculately Cassavetes cared less for the way a scene was figuratively composed than in how it felt or what it conveyed emotionally Hitchcocks tales were always plotfirst narratives with the human element put in the background Cassavetes put the human experience forefront in every one of his films If some things did not make much sense logically so be it One can see this even from his very first film 1959s Shadows filmed with a 16mm handheld camera on a shoe string budget of about 40000 in Manhattan with Cassavetes acting workshop repertory company and touted as an improvisatory film The story is rather simple as it follows the lives of three black sibling Manhattanites Benny Ben Carruthers a trumpeter and no account Hugh Hugh Hurd a washed up singer and Lelia Lelia Goldoni the younger sister of both The films three main arcs deal with Hughs failures as a nightclub crooner and his friendship with his manager Rupert Rupert Crosse Bennys perambulations in an about Manhattan with his two no account pals and Lelias lovelife first with a white boy Tony Anthony Ray who does not realize lightskinned Lelias race even after bedding her then with stiff and proper Davey Davey Jones who may be a misogynist In the first arc nothing much happens except darkskinned Hugh gets to pontificate on how degraded he feels to be singing in low class nightclubs and opening shows for girly acts He dreams of making it big in New York or even Paris but one can tell he is the type of man who will continue deluding himself of his meager skill for the one time we actually get to hear him sing he shows hes a marginal talent at best That Rupert keeps encouraging him gives us glimpses into how destructive friendships work But this is the least important of the three arcs While this film is better overall than say Martin Scorseses first film a decade later Whos That Knocking At My Door another tale of failed romance and frustrated New Yorkers it has none of the brilliant moments actingwise nor cinematographically that that film has It also is not naturalistic for naturalism in art is a very difficult thing to achieve especially in film although the 1950s era Manhattan exteriors at ground level is a gem to relive While Shadows may indeed be an important film in regards to the history of the independent film circuit it certainly is nowhere near a great film Parts of it are preachy poorly acted scenes end willynilly almost like blackout sketches and sometimes are cut off seemingly in the middle All in all its a very sloppy job especially the atrocious jazz score that is often out of synch with the rest of the film as Cassavetes proved that as a director at least in his first film he was a good actor The only reason for anyone to see Shadows is because Cassavetes ultimately got better with later films and this gives a clue as to his later working style The National Film Registry has rightly declared this film worthy of preservation as culturally significant This is all in keeping with the credo of art Cassavetes long championed as typified by this quote Ive never seen an exploding helicopter Ive never seen anybody go and blow somebodys head off So why should I make films about them But I have seen people destroy themselves in the smallest way Ive seen people withdraw Ive seen people hide behind political ideas behind dope behind the sexual revolution behind fascism behind hypocrisy and Ive myself done all these things So I can understand them What we are saying is so gentle Its gentleness We have problems terrible problems but our problems are human problems That this film is culturally significant is true but that truth is not synonymous with its being artistically significant It is in the difference between these two definitions where great art truly thrives
1,You the Living 2007 Mordant Ive never written that word before but it comes to mind here Let me look it up Well its part of itcorrosive but also funny as heck So corrosively funny This is a dour film for sure with so much dry dry dry wit and quirky humor its impossible not to like it on some level Filmed in a very spare style often with a static camera and really balanced stable compositions like theater stages we see a short enactment occur But that makes it seem ordinarywhich it is not Ordinary life is shown to be frumpy ironic delightful coy and depressing And impossible We the living must live and since were alive we may as well take note Something like that I think it was Ebert who said you find yourself laughing and dont know why Exactly And the promo material somewhere said it was a cross between Bergman and Monty Python and what they mean is it has the dry silent probing look of Ingmar Bermans famous Swedish films but it has the zany somehow touching elements of the British comedians  Id say definitely definitely watch at least half an hour of this There is part of me that thought I was through by thenthe rest continues in a similar assemblage of little skits and moments and they do gradually evolve but there is no great plot to follow or climax of the usual kind There are some great moments later even just the attention to the thunderstorm which takes us out of the mundane human events nicely  The filming is gorgeous in its classical control almost like a series of Gregory Crewdson scenes and outdoing the photographer actually And the acting with all its very ordinary nonglam folksiness is right on A startling beautiful odd experience
1,The casting of Robert Culp is probably the only decent move the production team made with this film Falk and Culp were marvellous but as culp was not Falks nemesis this time chemistry was lacking Columbo is only as strong as his opposite number and this time he didnt have one
1,WOW I Love this movie This is definitely added to my list of Ghetto Movies Juice  Starring Tupac I dont giva F Menace II Society  ODawg Ill smoke Anybody I just dont giva F New Jersey Drive  Hey they steal cars in broad daylight they obviously dont giva f New Jersey Drive is the best hood movie ever It is at the top of the list menace II society is second and juice is third Clockers is really stupid The soundtrack for New Jersey Drive is Pwnage too Mac Mall  Young Lay  All about my fetti is heard through out the movie Lords of the underground  Burn rubber another good song and so is Ill  Al Scratch  dont shut down on a player If your a fan of GTASA youll freaking love this movie AND The amazing soundtrack The soundtrack is basically Rap about stealing cars  SWEETTTT Movie
1,There has been a political documentary of recent vintage called Why We Fight which tries to examine the infamous Military Industrial Complex and its grip on this nation It is considered both polemical and incisive in making its case against both that complex and the war fiasco we are currently involved in in Iraq Yet a far more famous series of films with the same name was made during World War Two by Hollywood director Frank Capra Although considered documentaries and having won Oscars in that category this series of seven films is really and truly mere agitprop more in the vein of Leni Reifenstals Triumph Of The Will scenes of which Capra recycles for his own purposes That said that fact does not mean it does not have vital information that subsequent generations of World War Two documentaries such as the BBCs lauded The World At War lacked nor does that mean that its value as a primary source is any the less valuable They are skillfully made and after recently purchasing some used DVDs at a discount store I found myself with the opportunity to select a free DVD with my purchase I chose Goodtimes DVDs four DVD collection of the series Rarely has something free been so worth invaluable While there are no extras on the DVDs and the sound quality of the prints varies these films provide insight into the minds of Americans two thirds of a century ago when racism was overt as in many of the classic Warner Brothers prowar cartoons of the era and there was nothing wrong with blatant distortion of facts The seven films produced between 1942 and 1945 are Prelude To War The Nazis Strike Divide And Conquer The Battle Of Britain The Battle Of Russia The Battle Of China and War Comes To America Overall the film series is well worth watching not only for the obvious reasons but for the subtle things it reveals such as the use of the plural for terms like X millions when referring to dollars rather than the modern singular or the most overused graphic in the whole series a Japanese sword piercing the center of Manchuria Yet it also shows the complexities of trying to apply past standards to current wars The lesson of World War One avoid foreign entanglements was not applicable to World War Two whose own lesson act early against dictatorships has not been applicable in the three major wars America has fought since Korea Vietnam nor Iraq The fact that much of this series teeters on the uncertainties of the times it was made in only underscores its historic value in todays informationclogged times It may not help you sort out the truth from the lies and propaganda of today but at least youll realize you are not the first to be in such a tenuous position nor will you be the last
1,I had my son for the weekend and my parents called me up and said that they wanted the two of us to meet them at the movies When I got there my mom said that she really wanted to see The Women and asked if my son and I minded due to it being labeled as a chick flick I reluctantly agreed thinking this was going to be another First Wives Club type movie I gotta say that I was very surprised to find myself really enjoying the movie from the opening scene to the credits It was a great production and the cast was perfect in their roles My son and I found ourselves laughing through entire movie and we are glad that we saw it It made for a great Saturday afternoon movie and I highly recommend it to anyone man or woman
1,First I rated this movie 1010 To me its simply one of the best I saw since I was born Im 23 but I saw numerous films The story is cruel but reality is too not  It went deep into me and stirred my bowels I saw it about 5 or 6 years ago and it still shakes me  and I still remember it  Second there is no national preference this expression is a direct translation from the French for this movie I mean its not because it is a French movie that I put it so high  it has really caught me when I saw it Furthermore I dont know well Marcel Carnes filmography so I dont know if it is or not his best movie but I know it is not his most famous  Hotel du Nord Quai des Brumes and Les Enfants du Paradis are the most famous Third the movies in BW but it deals with intertemporal problems of youth not acne like love friends and studies in a modern way It could even be remade framebyframe with actual young actors a Dolbytm sound and special effects a car crash it would still be a great film  Problem  Maybe is it a film to be seen by young adults from 16 to 25 years old  and above of course  for its message to be well understood Did I say it was a great movie 
1,This is actually the first movie I ever saw in a theatre  where the people didnt leave immediately when the end credits started In stead they remained seated for a few minutes  gaping with their mouths open staring in the infinite  trying to understand what they ve just seen The only thing I can say Try to go watch this movie with as little knowledge about it as possible so did I I gave it a 10
1,This film is great with some of the best songs preformed by Bon Jovi and kissThe film is about a man named ChrisMark WahlbergWho is the biggest fan of a band named Steel DragonAnd then when he gets the gig for lead singer his world changes upside downWith great acting by Jennifer Aniston this film is a must see for rock lovers 45 stars
1,Little Dieter Needs to Fly was my first film during the 1999 edition of the Göteborg Filmfestival As I was extremely tired that evening I was hesitant to see it but the raving overall score of 9 here at IMDB made me go there It was 80 minutes of pure lifeforce Experiencing Dieter Denglers life through his own telling was enchanting SEE IT And if possible see it at a cinema

1,If you took a really good jack black movie added a little jeepers creepers and then a dash of joyride with a hint of texas chainsaw massacre and house of a 1000 corpsesyou would have MONSTER MAN i went into this movie not really expecting much at all but i wound up really enjoying the movie the whole premise is really cheesy a monster man in a monster truck chases down people but it is so funny that the writerdirector doesnt expect you to take it seriously justin urich is a comic gem and should have a very promising career he is identical to jack black the only problem with the film is the unbelievable hero role played by eric jungmann but overall if you are looking for a really really fun movie that will crack you up until you are rolling in the aisles and at the same time scare the crap out of youcheck out this film
1,Crossing the Bridge The Sound of Istanbul is one of the best music documentaries that I have seen lately and is more than a film about music It is also a musical love declaration about a fabulous city one of the greatest city in Europe and the world one of the most important cities for Europe history and for Islam the city that may bridge in the future Europe and the Middle East or may signify once again as is already happened in history the precipice between two worlds Then there is the music The interesting approach that the film takes with regard to music is that it starts from modern music and we hear a lot of good rock and rap in the first third of the film An then like a backwards move in time the soundtrack takes us to the roots to Turkish traditional music to commercial romances and to the exotic instruments that are basic elements in the landscape of Turkish music In such a complex and conflict ridden country as Turkey is the film does not avoid some of the political aspects like censorship introduced by the military rule in the 80s or the relevance of the songs of the minorities especially the Kurdish one One of the best musical moments is actually provided by a Kurdish singer with a fantastic voice singing in a cathedralshaped hamam Turkish bath One gets to love the city and its music by the end of the viewing and hearing of this film I have never been to Istanbul but after having seen this film I am sure that I want to visit this place soon
1,Nothing is sacred Just ask Ernie Fosselius These days everybody has a video camera and a movie is hardly out before the spoofs start flying quickly written and shot and often posted directly to the internet Spoofs are hot these days and we go out of our way to make sure filmmakers dont get off on their own selfimportance 25 years ago when the first Star Wars was made it was a different world Filmmaking was the playground of a select few and spoofs were very rare Then God gave us Hardware Wars It was shot to look cheap or was it just cheap and the audio was obviously recorded after the fact Does that take away from the experience HECK NO Thats what makes it so great It was raw and unpolished and hit relentlessly on some of the more pretentious moments of the original movie From Fluke Starbucker waving around a flashlight instead of a lightsaber I did that when I was young to Chewchilla the Wookie Monster to Auggie Ben Doggies nah just a little headache remark this film short is as much a part of the phenomenon as any of the actual Star Wars films Rent it Buy it Borrow it from a friend And may the Farce be with you Always
1,Crackerjack is a hit and miss film set in the Australian suburban lawn bowls club of Cityside Mick Molloy plays a scammer who has been scoring free parking spaces at Cityside When the club is put under pressure to install poker machines in its premises they need to raise 8000 to keep this from happening The club needs new members to help and this is where Mick molloys character comes in and has to bowl to save the club With many up and coming and aging Australian actors Crackerjack is a hidden gem Be warned though most of the jokes are for those with a knowledge of lawn bowls but there are many amusing sight gags that provide comical relief Sam Johnson and Judith Lucy costar Overall the movie should be recommended for people who play lawn bowls or have played but there is enough other material in there for an amusing play if you have a slight understanding If you enjoy Australian humour I suggest you get youre bowling whites on and head on out to the theatre because this is the premiere lawn bowls comedy of the yearalso the only one
1,Went out with my friends and saw this movie last weekend here in London We didnt know what to expect the poster gave some of it away and I wont say any more so as not to spoil the plot but we found it to be an excellent film with great acting convincing plot and scary as hell Having done some research on the making of the film I have to hand it to those guys the filmmakers actors writers etc for having put together such a film with such limited resources Postproduction very well done too For all of that I give them a 10 out of 10 and I hope they will continue their fine work Keep it up guys You rock
1,While it comes no closer to the Tarzan of Edgar Rice Burroughs than say the Johnny Wiesmuller flicks did it does have its own peculiar and entertaining slant on the story Its a well done Tarzan movie Nice scenery good photography workable continuity and a Tarzan yell that echos the one described by Burroughs The players all perform well The only bad points I found were I think related It moves slow in places That slow movement Makes this picture to long It could easily have been 15 to 20 minutes shorter which I think would have helped with the natural flow of the plot line and the character development But the rest of the film works well enough to carry it over these two rough spots and still leave the viewer satisfied with the flick Short version of all the above  Its a very GOOD Tarzan movie
1,Lackawana Blues An impressive HBO movie about a beautiful woman that made her house a home for several charactersTouchingaliveentrancinga great mix of sound and story based on a true story featuring an AllStar castA time capsule about  you get the point and no I am not on the payola for the HBO crew I would throw around more superlatives but I am about to go out  The extras on the DVD include a deleted scenea featurette and commentaryThe funniest part about the featurette was star lighting they used when interviewing exec producer Halle Berry OK seriously  good times A
1,Despite what its critics ensue I enjoyed immensely for precisely what it is Eyecandy for both sides of the gender spectrum Soderberg has done the artsy hard edge stuff before won Oscars is at the top of his game Oceans 12 is light commercial fluffy Steves day at the Midway if you will I am generally not a fan of ZetaJones but even I must admit that Kate is STUNNING in this movie Its ending screams of an upcoming trequel and I will be one of the millions who flock to see 120 minutes of George and Brad and Matt parlay through Clooneys digs in Lago di Como as they swindle some rich bad guy again and again If we tolerated 3 installments of the Lord of the Rings I ask if we can drool over Clooneys salt and pepper lid just one more time
1,I have seen this movie more than 50 times in my life and each time I watch it the movie is just as entertaining as it was the first time George Berger played by Treat Williams leads a small group of 1960s1970s era antiwar hippies living at large in New York City This small group happens upon a young man Claude Bukowski played by John Savage who has been drafted into the US Army for service in Vietnam Despite their best efforts to dissuade him Claude does eventually report for basic training in the Army Still distressed over his having left them the hippie group steal a car and travel across the USA to visit Claude for a couple of hours in the words of George Berger to an MP stationed at the entry gate of the Army base Claude is temporarily stationed at in Nevada The outcome is truly touching so I wont spoil it for those who have not yet seen this fantastic movie The musical score is equally fantastic Don Dacus of the rock group Chicago who plays the part of Woof  one of the hippies is a not a key character but the movie wouldnt have been the same without him Beverly DAngelo who plays Sheila Franklin an uptown girl who is befriended by the hippie group is sensational in her role A MUST SEE film
1,One night I was listening to talk radio and they had Leslie Nielsen on the program He went on to explain why there were only 6 shows  With TV shows like MASH you could go to the fridge to get a beer and as long as you heard what was going on you didnt miss anything But with Police Squad you HAD to watch the show with the sight gags you missed a whole lot if you didnt see them Who could forget  the part of town known as Little Italy with the coliseum in the background Even the movies relied heavily on the sight gags but then again being in the theater you were a captive audience Leslie also said the one reason the show movies and other movies like Airplane were funny is because they didnt attempt to tell what was funny It was up to the viewer to get the jokes Well thats just my 2 cents
1, Contains spoilers  A lovely film this starring Brad Renfro and the ever wonderful Joseph Mazzello I like Joseph Mazzello out of all his films Ive seen to date Ive loved every single one of them for many different reasons and The Cure is no different Brad Renfro does very well in this movie as well The Cure is a dramacoming of age movie from the viewpoint of an ill child and his friend The basic idea is Dexter Joseph Mazzello has AIDS He ends up befriending the kid next door Brad Renfro but Eriks mum is very narrowminded illinformed and somewhat thick when it comes to Dexters illness She thinks AIDS is contagious like the Common Cold so doesnt want her son going anywhere near Dexter After many attempts at making their own cure with no success the boys go on their way to New Orleans to find the cure after reading a pamphlet about it After getting their kicks from Playboy magazine Dexters health goes south shortly afterwards and as his health detoriates theres still enough life in the boy alongside Erik for two pranks of pretending to stop breathing Unfortunately poor Dexter does indeed die from his illness leaving poor Erik behind to wonder why he couldnt find the cure Throughout the movie he ends up bonding more with Dexters mother than his own It is a very heartwarming movie to watch and is not absolutely perfect movies rarely are but you wont care less about that as you get involved in the film more A must for Joseph Mazzello fans one of his best performances ever Very well recommended mustsee movie  if you can find a copy 
1,Im pleased that this was the work of foreign cinematographers because it cant be accused of unfair bias With absolutely no cause the Jacksonville cops rush to judgment in this case and pick the first black suspect to accuse of the murder of a white foreign tourist They picked a 15 yr old kid who is just about as close to a saint as you could randomly find and then make fools of themselves trying to pin an unlikely case against him In addition to the unfairness resulting from the blatant prejudice there is the matter of 6 months of unjust imprisonment of a completely innocent young black teenager It makes one question whether as a society we should compensate those who are charged imprisoned and subsequently found innocent This docudrama is well produced professionally recorded and presented in a captivating package from which you wont want to take a 1 minute break If you care about social justice dont miss this one It certainly deserved its Oscar
1,This flick was the introduction for a lot of us to the works of K Gordon Murray Thats because it was easy to find It was on every public domain label in the VHS era and before that a late night tv cult classic double knee thigh slapper Besides HOW do you resist the title For late comers a brief explanation of its merit Florida wheeler dealer K Gordon Murray imported Mexican horror films dubbed them into English then made a mint with them at the drive in The Mexican ORIGINALS were weird enough to begin with American boundaries and accepted horror film conventions were cheerfully disregarded Great great set design and lighting were placed beside weird or laughable special effects NOTHING in Hollywood was as close as these were to out and out strange Now mix in Catholic influenced social conventions Mexican folk lore and we are not in Kansas anymore  Add to THAT the English scripts they were dubbed into Most were written by Reuban Guberman who wanted words to match movements of the actors lips ON SCREEN not the literal translation As a result the American soundtracks tended to run from overwrought to down right loopy Theres even a fan web site for Murray that prints the best most over the top lines for each movie First time viewers to the films complain about the pacing the purple prose the production values and are told its SUPPOSED to be that waywhile the people laugh with enjoyment over things normally considered fatal film flaws It all must be very confusing if you dont have a taste for it This one was made back to back in 1957 with the two previous films in the series THE AZTEC MUMMY and CURSE OF THE AZTEC MUMMY All three are now available on the 3 disc AZTEC MUMMY COLLECTION BCI and its about time It has the K Gordon Murray version on one side the original Mexican production on the other side The contrast between the two is fascinating A lot of the times the original Spanish is not much saner ROBOTMUMMY starts off with a nice long flashback bringing you up to speed on the previous episodes sort ofcontinuity was tossed out the window in number two and its downhill from there logic wise You dont even get The Angel back or any mention of him in this final episode Names places even family trees switch between films After a while you start LOOKING for the continuity changes  By now the series villain Doc Krupp is totally pig biting mad nearly drooling with dementia and STILL wants to steal the Aztec breastplate Rosita Arenas is sent back to the past with another nice edit of the AZTEC MUMMY floor show and wanders out into the dark in her nightie to help find that doggone breastplate again The mummy isnt any happier with this then he was last time The robot actually has a production credit It was made by Viana  Co SA I mention this because it looks like the grips came up with it between takes on a slow afternoon when the real costume went walkabout Nope This was PLANNED  Wait until you see the controller it runs from X box where WERE you when Krupp NEEDED you The Robot LOOKS crushed to death at the end but actually came back in two more Mexican made moviesit had a FAN BASE  All in all a funny quirky finish to a three movie series Sit back and enjoy
1,Pulling in 26 million viewers one has to wonder what everyones opinions on the storylineplot is Reading the run down over at lifetime I was led to believe that this would be an edgeofyourseat thriller about a single mother being stalked and finally confronting the stalker Sadly I was mistaken While the main plot is interesting enough  Single mother run off road one night then is stalked by same guy the reasoning behind the stalking left nothing but a really bad taste in my mouth Laura Leighton plays the victim and she does it well Whether it was all those years on Melrose Place or not she does well in this movie playing a mother who would do anything to protect her son from harm and shes looking pretty good too these days Leighton is really the only good thing about this movie I think many people will identify with the main character after discovering why the stalker is stalking it will be a viewonlyonce type of movie
1,This scene shows how Wallaces experiment by using his brain manipulation invention goes terribly wrong creating the Were Rabbit His desire as a social entrepreneur is to improve society for the better therefore created a Brain Manipulator machine He risked his own life to help solve Tottingtons pests rabbit problem and more importantly to overcome the overcrowding of rabbits being collected and stored in his basement Though he thought his experiment worked however it resulted in placing more pressure on him and Gromit to find a solution before the Annual Vegetable Competition again risking his life Gromit who is a silent faithful dog and a loyal helper finds himself continuously thinking of innovative ways to save his master from his radical crazy inventions going terribly wrong What is interesting in this movie is trying to identify who is more entrepreneurial Wallace or Gromit
1,It is so nice to see Bruce Willis come down off his action throne and let us see that he really is a talented actor He shines in this film as the near40yearold image consultant who has totally lost touch with his inner childuntil he meets him face to face This is one of those rare films that doesnt talk down to its audience and truly offers something for the WHOLE family It is about caring for each other keeping some of the child inside you and realizing that you dont grow up exactly the way you thought you would Willis seems to be building an impressive track record for working with kids just witness The Sixth Sense with Haley Joel Osment and he has great chemistry with Spencer Breslin here There is some nice photography and music and the ending is wonderful and uplifting A great film to see with EVERY member of your family
1,This young filmmaker has a talent for capturing his audience quickly with unusual camera work and sparse but intense scripts The concept here of combining animation with live footage is remarkably wellexecuted and the soundtrack is very good The decision to release the movie in twelve parts online puts the onus on the director to make each episode fascinating enough for the viewer to invest in buying each upcoming episode I only wish all motion pictures had this kind of commitment to keeping their audiences entertained throughout their stories Highly recommended
1,Anthony Minghellas The English Patient is a film that takes us back to the golden years of Hollywood It is grand and impressive in scale and yet so heartbreakingly intimate in its portrayal of human love and suffering At the 1997 Academy Awards the film owned the night taking home nine awards from twelve nominations the most decisive cleansweep since Bernardo Bertoluccis The Last Emperor in 1988 Based on Canadian author Michael Ondaatjes 1992 Booker Prizewinning novel of the same name The English Patient is a touching meditation on life love and loss tracing the history of a criticallyburnt man in the aftermath of World War Two During the war a man Ralph Fiennes is discovered in the burning remnants of a crashed plane With his face scarred beyond recognition and with the man seemingly suffering from amnesia he is assumed to be an Allied soldier and is simply referred to as the English patient After the war in the mineridden hills of Italy a kind nurse Hana Juliette Binoche who has apparently lost everybody close to her remains in a ruined monastery to look after the dying man Over time she comes to learn more and more about her English patient who is actually revealed to be a Hungarian geographer Count Laszlo de Almásy Rather than losing his memory in the plane crash we learn that this scarridden man has perhaps chosen to forget his past both to protect himself from persecution and to cure himself of the tragic memories of his past love Via numerous flashbacks we learn of Almásys former exploits in the Sahara desert and his romantic liaison with a married woman Katharine Clifton Kristin Scott Thomas Its certainly easy to see why The English Patient was so successful at the Oscars It is such a beautiful film blending the quiet beauty of the Italian countryside with the endless golden sands of the desert Cinematographer John Seale captures the landscape to perfection not since David Leans magnificent Lawrence of Arabia has a film shown the desert with such beauty and grandeur making particularly good use of sweeping aerial shots from Almásys plane Even in the films more intimate moments excellent use of closeups and lighting capture the emotion of the scene coupled of course with the brilliant performances from all the cast members A longtime favourite actor of mine The English Patient might just contain Ralph Fiennes finest performance and considering his history includes such films as Schindlers List and The Constant Gardener this is not a complement that is to be taken lightly His Count Laszlo de Almásy is initially a very sympathetic character but as we slowly learn more about his past his likable qualities are eroded by his lessadmirable tendencies towards others Ownership is a major theme of the film When asked by Katherine what he hates most Almásy replies with Ownership Being owned When you leave you should forget me However as the relationship progresses and Katherine perhaps tries to distance herself from him Almásy reveals a hint of arrogance insisting that his love for her somehow entitles him to have her whenever he likes I want to touch you I want the things which are mine which belong to me Juliette Binoche who received an Oscar for her performance here is excellent as Hana the lonesome nurse who fears to love because of the tragedies that have always harmed those close to her After some time of caring for Almásy alone she is joined by a dubious Canadian thief David Caravaggio Willem Dafoe who lost his thumbs during the war and who suspects that it was Almásy who betrayed him to the Germans Hana also strikes up a tentative romantic relationship with Kip Naveen Andrews an Indian bombdiffuser in the British Army However due to her past history Hana is afraid that becoming involved with Kip will doom him to death particularly considering his very dangerous line of work At 160 minutes in length The English Patient wonderfully evokes memories of the classic romantic epics of old successfully finding a balance of mystery love joy and tragedy The ending of the film is heartbreaking and sorrowful but also uplifting in its own way Whilst some romantic relationships are doomed from the very beginning others have a very good chance of bringing happiness Nevertheless in every case it is always better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
1,I just saw it at the Toronto International Film Festival Director Neal Slavins impressive starring cast includes William Macy seen in The Contender at last years TIFF Meat Loaf AKA Meat Loaf Aday AKA Michael Lee Aday David Paymer and Laura Dern also starring in Novocaine also at this years Festival Based on the Arthur Miller novel by the same name Focus follows Christian but Jewishlooking Lawrence Newman Macy as he struggles among the hatred and antiSemitism in his neighbourhood Pitted between the Jewish storeowner down the street Paymer and his cardcarrying antiSemite next door neighbour Meat Loaf Newman faces difficulty in dealing with inner conflict and conflict around him Guilt over knowing whats right but not doing anything battles with wanting to blend in and keep peace with the neighbours Things gets more complex when he meets and marries Gertrude Dern who everyone thinks is Jewish Gertrude teaches her husband a few things about judging books by covers Will Newman stick up for the Jewish man in the end or will he flee Go see it to find out The acting was fabulous The writing was incredible The cinematography was excellent The sound was well done Technically amazing the movie was disturbing Chilling Emotionally intense I found myself bringing my knees up into the fetal position a couple of times I have great admiration for everyone who worked on it I have not seen a film this good in a long time It touched me Wow
1,This was the best film I saw in the year 2000 The Cohen brothers have never let me down before and they certainly didnt this time either Its one of those rare movies these days  its witty intelligent and vastly entertaining I left the cinema with a warmth in my heart Of course theres lot of Cohen stuff in there  odd characters and peculiar gadgets welldeveloped plot and magic camerawork But no Cohen film is resembling any other Cohen film if you overlook the general quality of them of course The big surprise for me was that Clooney is so good But the true master performance in this movie comes from Tim BlakeNelson But the rest of the cast is superb too A film that is lightweight comedy with a musical touch that evolve its story round rednecks and old time country music  dripping with wit and intelligence Thats a very unlikely combination But its exactly what this picture is
1,This game was one of the main reasons I actually got a PS2 I remember playing Soul Edge Sometimes called Soul Blade back in the day and I was hooked on it I did play the original Soul Calibur but I never got a chance to play it for a huge amount of time I did however buy the Gamecube version of Soul Calibur II and that was what truly got me hooked on the series and I was ecstatic when I heard of Soul Calibur III This game still gives us the classic characters such as Mitsurugi Cervantes Nightmare and Taki However it also adds several new characters such as Zasalamel Tira and the unplayable Night Terror The TRUE boss of Tales of Souls The strategy based Chronicles of thes Sword mode is a new feature which I really like it can be quite challenging in the later chronicles but its a good addition to the series The Soul Arena mode has several missions in which you must fight a certain enemy under certain circumstances The exception is Final Battle in which you simply must defeat Night Terror Its another fine touch that makes the game all the more fun In some scenes in Tales of Should you will be made to press certain buttons in order to get a different result this can be in order to dodgeblock an attack or to get a better ending Every character has two endings All in all this is an excellent game and Id recommend it if youre a fan of fighting games
1,Perhaps many viewers who got frustrated by this film live their lives without ever thinking deeply about life itself What i want to point out here is that distant is not only an arthouse film but one of the best arthouse films From all the arthouse films I have seen distant is the one that really stands out as a glittering piece of gold It is even fair to say that this films cinematography and depiction of human emotion surpass Tarkovskys Nostalgia One commentator got it right that sex a jaded common feature among foreign films is surprisingly lacking in distant and in a good way What is most remarkable about distant is that it captures the details of life we usually ignore and the rich essence of our existence that often gets buried under the din and visual extravaganza of our commercialized world Fortunately distant doesnt have that much to spare the audiences and what we see on the screen is a bare portrait of human beings
1,Christopher Nolans first feature film wowed critics who saw it when it first came out Shot on a micro budget of 6000 this is a student film with real class The film is shot in black and white and features people who you assume are friends of Nolans appearing in the movie This is not to say they are bad actors because they are quite good You could see Jeremy Theobald and Alex Haw appearing in other projects but unfortunately they havent since this was made 6 years ago Nolans thriller much like Memento does not play chronologically it shifts the scenes around much like Pulp Fiction The writing is fantastic It is a great twisting thriller but because the temporal order of the film is shifted around it makes it even more interesting I thought the last ten minutes in particular when everything starts to become clear were excellent For a film of such a small budget and with no recognizable names at all this is so good It is superior to most that Hollywood studios offer and Nolan after three films this the superior Memento and the not quite as good but still excellent Insomnia has cemented himself as the most exciting new talent of recent times I cant wait for Batman This film is short and sweet and certainly a great watch It is very professional and the twists are fantastic and completely surprising I also thought that the score from David Julyan was also excellent very atmospheric and had a chilly quality to it He has gone on to compose Nolans other films  Overall I would recommend this I intend to get all of Nolans films This is a low budget gem  
1,While the camerawork was certainly funky  perhaps one dutchroll short of stoned  the premise of the film was fantastic It really took a scathingly satirical in the true traditional of Hal Hartley look at God Jesus and Devil The interaction of Jesus and Satan provides some hilarious scenes Even the monologues of Jesus were great  this was by far the best Jesus Ive even seen So laidback Zenlike SonofGodish but still such a nice guy On one level this is a very general look on the paradoxes of Christianity but yet there is still a personal level where you can relate to Jesus Christ without having a GodComplex thanx to Martin Donovan and Hal Hartley
1,Im not a big TV person but when I saw the premier episode of Greek I couldnt wait until next week I dont miss the show for NOTHING THANK GOD for DVR LOL Im in love with Cappie he acts like a bad boy but he is so sweet Everybody has their own character so we have pretty much all types of people You could still throw in a Hispanic and a chubby persons I didnt go to school in USA so I never liked the idea of frat houses and stuff like that so when my husband told me about the show I didnt pay attention until he asked me to watch it and since I didnt have noting better to do I agreed I laughed SO hard the first night that I just needed to keep watching it So im with the other people that voted for this show to continue on I will hope for a second third and who knows how many more episodes Its a really good show very funny and entertaining
1,This is one of the best Bloke movies from the early 90s and whilst slightly dated its one of those movies that would never get made today which makes it very special In fact a very similar movie was made in the 90s called Masterminds and it was a PG variation on the same theme but it was nowhere near as fun or realistic for that matter So whats so special about this film Its the comradre between the main characters and the against all odds theme of the film Sean Astin is very likable and has starred in some of the most memorable films of the 8090s particularly The Goonies He also went onto greater things with Rudy and The Lord of the Rings Trilogy but Encino Man is a good trip down memory lane Will Wheaton from Stand by Me lends nice support to the film and Andrew Divoff is a terrific villain Louis Gossett Jr sleepwalks in his role but he does add some brevity to the film particularly his relationship with Astins rebellious nature So hows the action By todays standards its rather tedious and cheap looking almost like a TV movie but the production values are good and the violence is actually quite nasty for a film involving school students However the director makes up for the limited budget with some nicely suspenseful moments and well placed humor So park your brain at the door and enjoy this fondly remembered action flick but dont expect Oscar material
1,The title of the film seems quite appropriate given the persona of the lead character Fanda Hes an older man living in the late autumn of his life yet frolics about as a jubilant school boy whos just entered a spring meadow The frailties of old age and the warning signs of death are all illusions to him His wife supports this idea when she observes Fanda laughs at funerals and death In other words death is not something Fanda takes too seriously he has more important things to do than worry about what already is inevitable Life however and the pursuit of living life to its fullest is the philosophy that governs Fandas existence He is not one to merely exist but must live for each day and each passing moment for tomorrow is not guaranteed  The film seems to make a strong commentary about living as though there is no tomorrow let alone death Too many people take life much too seriously and consequently miss out on the actual living part of life Fandas wife for example shes so worried about preparing for death not in some religiously connotative way but in a far too practical even lifeless way that she forgets how to smile laugh and just have a good time Her humanity seems to have transformed into zombie autopilot mode Fanda to the contrary is perhaps too blithe and absentminded for his own good He needs a person like his wife Emilie to help balance him  Its as though Fanda possesses the invincible spirit of a child like a kid trapped in an older mans body He is introduced as the adventurous type he pretends to be people hes not in order to get gain squanders money factiously lies and is always up for a good laugh Deepdown though he is a kindhearted and gentle old man who wishes to be submissive to his overly pragmatic wife The two offset each other quite nicely though neither one of them truly appreciates the binary quality of their relationship until they metaphorically chance upon death meaning their divorce It is during this courtroom scene that Fanda realizes the reality of death and what it means if he is separated from his only love His wife emotionally recalls all of his flaws yet is tenderly drawn to continue to love him despite his crazy behavior In this moment of her forgiving him Fanda realizes his selfish behavior of driving his wife bonkers and makes an internal commitment to make her happy  Ironically though after making this commitment he becomes what his wife later calls a living corpse The lifeblood within him drains away as he becomes more like hera zombie going through daytoday motions He doesnt seem to live anymore but exist For example he gives up his zany pranks doesnt squander money quits smoking on account of his wife not his health and overall just acquiesces to whatever she wants of him Succinctly put he changes on account of wanting to make her happy Thus the binary quality of their relationship begins to slowly vanish Realizing that her husband is not who he used to be there is a part of Emilie that misses the old Fanda She misses her husbands aloofness and the fights they used to have because it was in those moments that they were truly living not just simply existing  I believe the filmmakers were trying to get across a specific message here that true and loving relationships will not always be easy or convenient but often times will take sacrifice and endurance to wade through the seemingly bad times The possibility of death at any moment is what reminds people to live for every moment Life is often taken for granted but when threatened with deathbe it literal or figurativepeople awake from their ungrateful slumbers and are aroused to start living life to its fullest Its as though they are scared that theyll never live again so they better make the most of it while they have it Fanda and Emilie had been married 44 years with fights along the way but it wasnt till they were both threatened with the possibility of deathlikeseparation that they began to show their true colors As the old maxim goes Love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation They both begin to see what matters most in life and that is the people they meet along the way More importantly the intimate relationships they make with their significant others
1,Tipping the Velvet 2002 TV was directed by Geoffrey Sax for BBC television The basic plot is a comingofage story for the protagonist Nan Astley played well by Rachael Stirling As a teenager Nan works in her familyrun oyster house Everyone expects her to stay at home then marry an appropriate husband and settle down to family life Nan expects this too Everything changes when Nan meets Kitty Butler Keeley Hawes a beautiful and talented performer who dresses in mens clothes and captures the hearts of her audience The audience includes Nan who is sexually attracted to Kitty in a way in which shes not attracted to her boyfriend  The remainder of the film follows Nan to London and through her ups sort of and her downs horrible as a lesbian and sometimes male impersonator  As is typical for the BBC every role no matter how small is performed by an excellent actor The BBC has a depth and breadth of performing artists that is truly marvelous None of the supporting actors stands out in my mindthey were uniformly good Both Stirling and Hawes are wonderful and their acting carries the film along Its always sad to be reminded of how difficult life can be for someone who doesnt fit societys mold for what is normal I know it isnt easy for lesbians even in the US even today Imagine the obstacles to love and happiness for lesbians in Victorian England Weve come a long way but we still have a long way to travel
1,A touching story told with tenderness awkward young Jewish girl in WWII America befriends an escaped German POW who is hiding out in her clubhouse They discuss their lives and beliefs hes antiHitler she sneaks him food he becomes her only friend and ally All this reminded me of the muchbetter theatrical film Whistle Down The Wind where Hayley Mills befriends convict Alan Bates but you certainly cant fault the direction here which is smooth or the performances which are sterling Mature in her preteen years Kristy McNichol carries most of the picture and never hits a false note Suddenly when the prisoner is discovered and Kristy is found out as well the movie gets very tough Her father shocked and ashamed that his child would consort with that Nazi lays into her with a quiet fury I have seldom seen before he tells her You are dead to me which must be devastating for a little girl to hear The final scenes dont cop out there are no big reunions no handholding climaxes The girl has to face the world and in doing so learns a bitter lesson about neighbors friends and family A startling film
1,Overall a well done movie There were the parts that made me wince and there were the parts that I threw my hands up at but I came away with something more than I gone in with I think the movie suffers from some serious excess ambition Without spoiling it let me say that the obvious references to the trial by fire in Ramayana is way beyond what this movie stands for The Ramayana is an epic Not a 200 page book that puts down women in India The movie is about two girls married into a very distinctive Indian family While the basic tenets of the unwritten laws of the family tradition seem to be that of conservative India let me assure my reader that I having lived in Delhi for 12 years found entire parts that just did not ring those bells I mean some things and some actions are very true but some other stuff is just way off the mark Especially today Delhi is complicated India is complicated The director tries to simplify both And fails pretty miserably at that Why in English Can you imagine a movie about American Indians in English Or the French speaking in English Seriously jarring Even the servant spoke in fluent accented English albeit with a hint of colloquialisms in the language for believability But the chemistry between the leads is palpable If you like it hot this is a movie for you I think that is the biggest saving grace  the development of a true real life love story If this film was about Radha and Sita then it would have got full marks from me And in being about them it could have made a subtle statement But this movie goes out there to say this is what India is and this is what Indian society is like And in that respect it succeeds as much as it fails Just take everything you see with a pinch of salt The dark secrets of India are not being revealed Just two girls are falling in love Just like it happens everywhere else
1,Eve is an eye opener because of the great sceneries and the techno music in the backgrounds we hear This movie shows a good aspect on the human body being Gods creation and to considerate about it viewers can earn better respect on the legendary story of Adam and Eve either if its true or just a fairy tale depending on what we believe from watching this movie Actressmodel Inger Ebeltofts impersonation of Eve is so good theres no good word to describe her performance and I cant imagine having another actress being Eve This movie to me comes in really handy for the type of therapy of stress relief Wed never fell so relax then before from watching this movie This movie is a masterpiece God supposedly wanted this movie to be made in the first place Mr Razbin
1,When this show first came on the air I saw it once or twice and thought it was another fat guy skinny wife show that seemed to populate the networks at the time It was just okay upon initial viewings and I didnt watch it again however once it went into syndication I caught several episodes simply because it was on twice a night and Im telling you the more you watch this show the funnier it is Once you see how all of the great supporting characters are connected this show makes you laugh out loud Every new episode I watch is more creative than the one beforepeople who only watch this a couple of times will not notice this The writing and story lines are much more sophisticated than they appear at first this is far from According to Jim First of all Kevin James is hysterical incredibly charming and a talented comedic actor as is the supporting cast Leah Remini has excellent timing and Patton Oswalts Spence is one of the funnier characters on the show And of course Jerry Stiller is brilliant as Arthur I was shocked to read comments that he was the worst part of the showhes a gigantic part of why this show is so greathis delivery of these ridiculous schemes rounding out the crazy dad character are beyond hilarious And the yellingthe best episode is when they show him as a kid yelling Lemon Icee That episode during which Carrie takes him to a therapist in hopes to get him medicated to make Doug less stressed out guest star William Hurt decides that Arthur yells because hes never been validated The latter part of the episode where Doug beats up his childhood self in a therapy session is beyond funny its one of the most creative scenes Ive seen on a sitcom I feel the strange need to defend this show because it is severely underratedwhile Friends was sometimes amusing and Raymond has some great episodes and characters they both lacked the creative touch that King of Queens has In an era where most sitcoms have canned jokes and are on the whole mediocre King of Queens continues to push the sitcom envelope and show real comic genius Critics of this show obviously dont get itor havent watched the show enough to give it a chance because anyone with real comic and creative sensibility has to laugh out loud while watching Its certainly on par with my other two favorites Seinfeld and The Office in its ridiculous tone Its the Arthurs Kramers and Michael Scotts of TV that keep us watching and laughing out loud
1,I really think this movie deserves some Oscars I really dont care what people can say badly about this moviebecause its a really well played parts from Samuel L Jackson and mainly by Christina Ricci Im a big fan of hers right since I saw her in Addams Familybeen trying to watch all things she makes and this is absolutely one of the best parts she played I love her looks even though people say shes not prettyI think she isand I love her eyes The movie is about many thingspeople say that is religiouspeople say that its about racismpeople say that is about drugspeople say that is about nymphomaniawellmaybe is a little bit of all that But what I truly feel is that this movie has a high level of eye opening for what blues iswhat it stands forand mainly were it comes from lifeheartpainsorrowand above allspontaneous feelings I hope you get to see itif you are that kind of person that likes a movie not only from the pictures or the story it tellsthis is a good movie to seeif your notwellsee it anywaycant hurt that much and you get to see Christina Ricci acting so horny Shes a fox
1,I just saw it at an advance screening I havent read the book but heard many good things about it The movie was absolutely fantastic very moving With a roller coaster of emotions you totally connect with the characters Shaun Toub was great it was a complete departure from his usual roles and his acting for those who understand PersianDari was incredible One thing to notes it that Khaled Hosseini actually loved the film which is unusual for book adaptation movies Even after seeing the movie several times he was sobbing Also the animation from the intro was exquisite with names displayed as if it were Persian calligraphy very unique At times the translation was not clearly conveying the message efficiently but all in all this was a great movie
1,This film is about Xavier an Erasmus exchange student from Paris who spends one year in Barcelona During that time under the influence of all the new impressions he changes and grows Upon return he has a much clearer view on his life and finally takes it into his own hands This is one of the most moving films Ive ever seen and the reason is probably that Ive been in a very similar situation Im from Germany not from France and for me it was Madrid not Barcelona but I can assure you that this film is a completely accurate depiction of what an Erasmus semester in Spain will do to you From what I hear the story is autobiographic and thats probably why it is so realistic Let me give some examples mild SPOILER alert  Xavier shares a flat with other students from Italy Denmark Germany Belgium Spain and England The flat looks EXACTLY like all the Erasmus shared flats Ive seen in Madrid The main characters are nicely developed and some funny scenes arise from the usual stereotypes The Spanish landlord is also 100 accurate  The story of Xavier and his girlfriend Martine who remained in Paris is also very typical About 90 of all relationships break up during an Erasmus semester or shortly thereafter  Theres a wonderful scene in which Xavier tries to convince Wendy his flatmate from England who is kind of uncool to go out with all the others He finally succeeds and Wendy probably has the night of her life Another great thing in this film is that its truly trilingual The students in the flat speak Spanish or English and Xavier speaks French with his mother and girlfriend There are subtitles so that everyone can understand whats being said I surely hope that this film never gets dubbed anywhere I can imagine that for nonErasmus people this is simply an entertaining comedy but for all my fellow Erasmus I can only say This is YOUR film If you havent seen it do so But be prepared for some feelings of nostalgia 1010
1,This movie was thought to be low budget but it turned out to be awesome I just rented it from blockbuster and i loved it The acting was very good hot women and some scary parts It is plain and simply worth the money to pay for
1,A MUST SEE documentaryThis movie had so many things to consider while watching it It was a great documentary of a trial of a 15 year old black kid named Brenton Butler He accused of killing a white tourist in Florida It shows how the police took statements from the husband of the dead woman of the description of the man that killed his wife The husband seemed to want to change some things to merge with what the police said the young man was wearing The police little to investigate the crime Brentons lawyer Patrick McGuinness is meticulous in getting information to help his client He tells the viewers what he thinks and the strategy he will use on the police to show their incomplete investigation and beatings against his young client to get him to confess The camera goes with McGuinness to where Brenton was questioned McGuinness also takes pictures of the room and how the audio is monitored He questions a policeman on the stand and ask what the heard Brenton say to one of the investigators and he challenges their own words McGuinness investigates with Ann Finnell each place the police should have gone and the things they should have done but did not The movie shows the Butlers as a loving Christian family who have faith in their sons innocence and faith that God will set Brenton free They visit him in jail and pray with him there to encourage him There are scenes of group prayer for Brenton the lawyers the Judge and everyone involved in this case I am a white and I was surprised to see how blacks in high police positions treat other blacks It was very disappointing to see black and white police stick together when they think they got their man Police have a hard job and I believe most of them are honorable not like the ones in this movie I think this is a great movie for anyone involved in the Judicial system including Judges police and lawyers and even potential jurors to watch this movie and learn from it

1,I saw The Reader at a film festival in Manhattan this week It touched my heart in a way that few short films have done In ten or so minutes it tells a poignant twocharacter story that resonated deeply with me Duncan Rogers has done a superb job capturing very real tender moments on film What I really admire about this film is that the director has chosen a story appropriate to the short format These are genuinely interesting characters and their story is told in the perfect length of time This is no small feat Havent we all seen shorts that are simply longer stories squeezed to fit the format or stage stories that werent properly adapted to screen I applaud The Reader for really doing it right and I encourage anyone who is interested in film and in storytelling to look at it seriously Worth every moment
1,Not being a fan of the Coen Brothers or George Clooney anyone can see the skepticism I took into the theater Once again someone in Hollywood dares to create something different This time it was those zanie for a temporary lack of a better word Coens doing their thing to one of the great works in literary history Who wouldve ever thought Homer had this in mind I dont know where this film is going to fit in the history books of Hollywood but it will be in both mine and many others DVD or VHS library It is one of those films that you can watch over and over The story is brilliantly written Clean and entertaining with a couple of Gumpesque brushes with fame great performances by Clooney Turturro Nelson and a brief but hilarious Holly Hunter Being born in Mississippi and raised in other parts of the south I wish more people would poke a little fun at us like this They even invoke a soundtrack fitting for the rural south You are NOT doing anything better this weekend go see this movie 
1,Hayao Miyazaki has captured the imagination of audiences young and old across the globe and his most recent cinematic work of art is Ponyo a childrens fairytale borrowing on story elements from The Little Mermaid Of course like other Miyazaki classics such as Spirited Away and his last film Howls Moving Castle Ponyo is full of a creativity that can only be truly appreciated by adults but this it is distinctly more a childrens story than those recent efforts Its a magical story best described as beautiful and lovable aiming for charm instead of conflict Ponyo is the story of a bugeyed childishlooking fish of the same name the daughter of an undersea sorcerer who longs to escape the sea and become a little girl When she does she quickly befriends a young boy named Sosuke In the process she gains a strong magic and unknowingly throws the world out of balance between land and sea and a giant storm drowns most of the clifftop town where Sosuke lives with his mother and it threatens to end the world Like Howls Moving Castle Walt Disney picked up Ponyo for an American release and dubbed it over with an impressive selection of Western voices even choosing homegrown products in the youngest siblings of Disney band the Jonas Brothers Frankie Jonas and Miley Cyrus younger sister Noah to voice Sosuke and Ponyo respectively Also voicing characters are Liam Neeson Fujimoto Ponyos father Tina Fey Lisa Sosukes mother Matt Damon Sosukes father Cate Blanchett Ponyos sea goddess mother and a trio of hilarious elderly women are played by Betty White Cloris Leachman and Lily Tomlin The effort is definitely there to make this film appeal to American audiences and Disney is getting close But voices are of little significance in a Miyazaki film which is all about visual creativity A fan of transformations and animating liquid and fluid motion creating a fairytale taking place partly underwater mustve been a joy for Miyazaki to work with and maybe even his entire motivation for choosing this story Among the highlights are droplets of water that Fujimoto sends after Ponyo that move like living waves as well as a variety of other magnificent sea creatures and breathtaking storm scenes make Ponyo as awing as any other Miyazaki film As a childrens story however Ponyo concentrates its efforts on being adorable The discovery of true friendship and love between Sosuke and Ponyo is heartwarming even if Noah Cyrus shouting childishly when Ponyo excitedly embraces human life can get a bit annoying But as delightful as many of the imaginative elements and loving relationships are theres very little antagonism or danger Past Miyazaki films have clear villains but the conflict in Ponyo actually shrinks as the story goes along Sosuke believes hes lost his mother at one point and in the background is the idea of the world going out of whack and that humans should be ashamed of polluting the sea but Ponyo is mostly tension free Most glaringly its climax is uneventful despite how overall likable all the characters are Ponyo will surely satisfy Miyazakis fans in every way with its imagination and newcomers will still be smitten by his simple yet visually ambitious storytelling but this is distinctly more of a childrens movie best for families and others who love fantasy regardless of its form or target audience Its not quite what youd expect from Miyazaki considering his recent work but its sure to be remembered as another of his beloved stories Steven C Visit my site at httpmoviemusereviewsblogspotcom
1,The best romantic comedy Ive seen in years Not the kind of slick over the top Hollywood stuff by Ben Stiller or Adam Sandler and a lot less syrupy than a Hugh Grant epic Julianne Nicholson and Jay Mohr are perfectly cast and both deliver smoothly professional performances as the engaged couple who decide to spend a little time sowing their sexual oats before marriage Instead of playing it strictly for laughs the writers and director concocted a nice blend of human feelings and comedic action Nicholson is just great as the awkward seductress and Mohr does a great job as the man who reluctantly enters into the game but soon finds himself enjoying his flings a little too much We see just enough of the supporting characters to nicely round out the plot without distracting from the main story Andy Richter earnest friend and Helen Slater distraught singlemom are particularly good There is enough meaning and emotional complexity to make this a lot more than a standard boygirl farce Indeed with just a little better pacing and a tiny bit more cutting this film would be a top ten comedy
1,Alter Egos do not come funnier than the creation of Sacha Baron Cohens Ali G Completely misled by his delusional and nonexistent sense of the Middle England Suburban surroundings that his social background consists of He persists on living the style of a Los Angeles Gansta While still living with his Gran in the London suburb of Staines he keeps tight control of his Posse the West Staines Massiv Spending his spare time between Me Julie his girl the Posse and teaching local eight year old Scouts at Keep it Real advanced lessons at the Government funded John Nike Leisure Centre This is where the story takes off being told that the Government funding has stopped Ali G then proceeds on a oneman quest In the struggle for Justice I iz willing to lay down me Life just like Martin Luther Van Dross did Being his reply to the local media crew when interviewing him on hunger strike while chained to a fence Charles Dance here plays David Carlton the sinister and devious Deputy Prime Minster who is Even more eviller than Skeletor Using Ali G unknowingly to lose the Prime Minster 18000 votes three weeks before the General Election Seeing Ali G as a bumbling idiot his plan backfires Ali G suddenly becomes an over night sensation and a saviour of the people working directly with the Prime Minster The story becomes more sinister and with hilarious consequences Ali G Indahouse is a great British movie that brings the hugely talented attributes of writing along with Dan Mazer executive production and acting of Sacha Baron Cohen Charles Dance and Michael Gambon as the PM play their parts with great seriousness among the gags and hilarity that is Ali G Ironically seeing the parodies playing their parts in a World that really is real and who are continually preaching Keep it Real from their own little World that is the West Staines Massiv is true comic paradox Directed by Mark Mylod his first full length feature film since directing television work such as Shameless Shooting Stars The Fast Show and the Smell of Reeves and Mortimer to name a few Very Real and very funny
1,I remember catching this film on a C4 screening a year ago and I was completely blown away by the whole thing I thought the film managed to represent such a diversity of genres the supernatural a love story the intrigue of crime and so many more I was hooked on the whole thing after a minute or so and was really concerned about the characters It made me feel terrified at one second for Jimmy and then had me laughing away at the gangsters in the next and all the time I had my fingers crossed that things would work out for Jimbo Heath Ledger and Rose Bryne are superb Bryan Brown is absolute quality and had me creasing up along with David Field who was funny as well as being an evil git Since I saw this film I managed to order it on DVD and as a result every person I show it to has been hooked in much the same way This film is perfect for a Sunday afternoon or a lazy evening and its one that you can really appreciate with your mates around
1,This film powerfully demonstrates the struggle of two women in love in a culture so deeply entrenched in ritual and tradition All this against a backdrop of an India which itself is struggling for freedom from these same values This film is both political and personal and never too preachy or idealistic on either front It is easy to see why Fire has caused riots in India but tragic nonetheless A true film such as this one deserves to be seen by all people of the world not just privileged westerners
1,Adam Eric Jungmann and obnoxious best friend Harley Justin Urich are driving cross country to a wedding Along the way they pick up sexy hitchhiker Sarah Aimee Brooks Then for no reason a monster truck keeps trying to run them off the roadand maybe kill them Who is doing this and why Pretty good horror film Its energetic and full of flashy direction which gets you right into the action Its also a horror comedy Most of the humor is infantile and REALLY gross but actually somewhat funny Also this movie really piles on the gore at timesbut thats a GOOD thing The acting is OKJungmann overplays his nerd role a bit much Urich is stuck with the hopeless role of the foulmouthed sexobsessed best friendbut pulls it off Brooks is good too in a limited role BUT I could see the twist ending coming long before it happened and logic totally disappears at the end especially the rescue Still this is a gory sometimes funny and sometimes scary horror movie I give it a 7
1,I am a huge fan of Harald Zwart and I just knew that I had to see this movie even though I cant say Im a soccer fan But watching this just filled my heart with joy and I had a great time in the movies watching it Bjørn Fast Nagell does a tremendous job directing this movie and even though you notice the main characters are new at acting they grow with the movie and makes it what it is Even though it is supposed to be a soccer movie there is surprisingly little soccer in it The whole idea is to show the six guys making up the word N O R W A Y on their trip to the World Cup in soccer playing in Germany this year  If youre only gonna see one Norwegian movie this year this is the one
1,I cant stand people who comment on this program or other HBO programs as too graphic or unnecessarily graphic or that they contain gratuitous nudityviolencesodomy etc Guess what Prison life isnt PG13 The gratuitous graphic content is TRUE TO LIFE of this situation Prison contains inmate rapekillingsdrug deals and showers If you dont like it then dont watch the program Im certainly no fan of prison rape but if it was left out of the show Id be surprised and lend the show less credibility If the prisoners didnt curse it would just be silly Sure its gratuitous language but that is REALISTIC The show is good some of the viewersnot so much I guess
1,I saw this movie over 5 years ago and the subject still infuriates me as it should Her anger and initiative were inspiring Not that I would takeover an army and kill people but the scene at the well and at the rebel strong hold will never leave my mind This is a great film but be prepared for the strong subject matter
1,1930s comedy mystery about The Crooked Circle a band of hooded crooks who set about plotting the murder of some one who swore to oppose them Enjoyable but really unremarkable little film the movie works simply because the cast headed by Zazu Pitts and James Gleason both of whom would later appear together in a couple of Hildegarde Withers films after Edna Mae Oliver dropped out of that series and supported by a great cast of actors and actresses you know but may not know the name of I dont hence the lack naming A breezy hour long romp the movie doesnt make a great deal of sense with mistaken identity secret passages ghostly music and people not being who they seem Its the perfect thing for a dark and stormy night or a late night viewing when one is nostalgic for the late late show
1,Ah When good actors take on bland material If you are thinking of this movie as a tight police thriller you may be disappointed While the situations are very true to life the plot proceeds at a very predictable clip and you can pretty well see what lays ahead way before the actors take you there Many of the criminals and secondary figures are really just stereotypes in motion Much of the dialog is just plain silly But If you love to see good actors rise above this kind of material and make something of it then you will LOVE this movie Sam Elliott is nothing short of brilliant in taking the onenote character of Detective Falon come alive with depth and pathos Those of you who have never seen Elliott emote that much beyond his usual scowling stoic stances will be delighted at the range of emotion he depicts in this film And also in his early fifties in this film he looks fantastic His bare chest scene gives hope to middle aged men everywhere Esai Morales does a wonderful job elevating his role as Det Falons eager beaver new police partner He could have easily played it as a Robin to Elliotts Batman but instead he breathed a genuineness and passion into this role He makes it work despite some of the lame lines he is given to say Paul Sorvino is fun to watch He plays the eccentric police captain He seems to know he is slumming in this movie and is having a ball doing it He makes it fun for us too This movie is very bythenumbers in plot but makes up for it with great performances Sam Elliott fans should definitely get this one as it is suck a kick to see him spread his wings and do so much more than he usually is allowed to do
1,The original The Man Who Knew Too Much brought Alfred Hitchcock acclaim for the first time outside of the United Kingdom Of course part of the reason for the acclaim was that folks marveled how Hitchcock on such a skimpy budget as compared to lavish Hollywood products was able to provide so much on the screen The original film was shot inside a studio For whatever reason he chose this of all his films to remake Hitchcock now with an international reputation and a big Hollywood studio behind him Paramountdecided to see what The Man Who Knew Too Much would be like with a lavish budget This is shot on location in Marrakesh and London and has two big international names for box office This was James Stewarts third of four Hitchcock films and his only teaming with Doris Day and her only Hitchcock film I do wonder why Hitchcock never used Doris again At first glance she would fit the profile of blond leading ladies that Hitchcock favored Possibly because her wholesome screen image was at odds with the sophistication Hitchcock also wanted in his blondes  Doris does some of her best acting ever in The Man Who Knew Too Much Her best scene is when her doctor husband James Stewart gives her a sedative before telling her their son has been kidnapped by an English couple who befriended them in Morocco Stewart and Day play off each other beautifully in that scene But Doris especially as she registers about four different emotions at once  Day and Stewart are on vacation with their son Christopher Olsen in Morocco and they make the acquaintance of Frenchman Daniel Gelin and the aforementioned English couple Bernard Miles and Brenda DaBanzie Gelin is stabbed in the back at a market place in Marrakesh and whispers some dying words to Stewart about an assassination to take place in Albert Hall in London Their child is snatched in order to insure their silence For the only time I can think of a hit song came out of a Hitchcock film Doris in fact plays a noted singer who retired from the stage to be wife and mother The song was Que Sera Sera and I remember it well at the age of 9 You couldnt go anywhere without hearing it in 1956 it even competed with the fast rising Elvis Presley that year Que Sera Sera won the Academy Award for Best Song beating out such titles as True Love from High Society and the title song from Around the World in 80 Days It became Doris Days theme song for the rest of her life and still is should she ever want to come back In fact the song is worked quite nicely into the plot as Doris sings it at an embassy party at the climax Instead of doing it with mirrors Hitchcock shot the assassination scene at the real Albert Hall and like another reviewer said its not directed its choreographed Youll be hanging on your seats during that moment This was remake well worth doing
1,Shtrafbat  Penal Battalion is a moving and mostly honest look at the lives and deaths of Soviet soldiers who were sentenced to wash away their crimes with blood during World War Two One can almost call it the Russian equivalent of highly acclaimed Band of Brothers miniseries Formed in July of 1942 on the eve of Battle of Stalingrad the penal battalions were considered expendable units and suffered horrible casualties sometimes as high as 90 Prisoners of GULAG political prisonconcentration camps deserters soldiers who were captured by Germans but managed to escape soldiers accused of breaching protocol were all given a chance to join the Shtrafbat and prove that there were not Traitors of the Motherland with their lives Those who sustained injuries and those who died in battle were considered rehabilitated and were reinstated in the eyes of the law This miniseries features a look at one such Shtrafbat under the command of Tverdokhlebov  an honorable officer who was captured by the Germans was shot and left for dead It features a colorful and varied group of people thrust into a situation from which there is no escape The authoritative yet honorable crime boss Antip Kulak The Fist and his little gang of unreformed criminals a young Jewish intellectual who struck his antiSemite officer Father Orthodox Priest Mikhail who joins the battalion when his parish is destroyed in the housetohouse fighting political prisoners who hate the regime that condemned them to the GULAG but who are nonetheless willing to fight one last time for their people and country must all find their courage and their reasons to keep on living and to keep on fighting Although set during a war not every episode features combat in fact what combat scenes there are are often chaotic sporadic and short  which was probably the intent of the director In between the miniseries focuses on various relationships between the cast their backgrounds their thoughts and tragedies The rape of a young woman by one of Shtrafbats soldier and then his execution execution for supposed AWOL periods of boredom on the march the celebration and subsequent consequences of finding a German bunker stocked with food and champagne the moral dilemma of officers unable to save their men from their own superiors cheating on a spouse and other situations feature prominently The camera is unflinching  it does not turn away from the ugliness of war and the ugliness of human nature nor from raw human emotions The dialog likewise does not censor out the swearing The acting is superb and deep and the script is likewise well written Everything from rage to weariness to resignation to finding a scrap of joy to hang on to is rendered almost faultlessly One complaint might be that some of Russian linguistic and cultural idiosyncrasies may not always be understood by someone not familiar with the language and culture Because it is a history drama in a sense some of the terms and situations military rank mention of other battles certain historical references may be lost on some viewers This understanding is not needed to thoroughly enjoy Shtrafbat but these references are a nice touch of authenticity Another complain that could be levied is an occasional anachronism and bending of history to suit the plot but frankly this is such a riveting miniseries that one will likely forgive these slight mishaps
1,ApartmenteL is one of the most interesting movies that I have ever seen I experienced extreme frustration while watching this movie as I was gunning for the two leads to reunite That never happened in the end which disappointed me to no end But the ending lends an even more cynical touch to a generally cynical movie It is not a movie which people are likely to rewatch but one watch itself will have a deep impact on people As of now I havent rewatched the movie and I dont think I will The story follows the experiences of a man Max who is engaged to be married to Muriel He remembers his old girlfriend Lisahe considers this the love of his life as he listens by accident to Lisa talking on the telephone Thus he tries to find Lisa Here starts his extremely frustrating search for Lisa There are many layers to this movie There are undercurrents of jealousy vouyeurism and so on There is also another character called Alice who is involved in the whole confusion The movie then moves through a whole range of twists and finally leads to an ending which could be interpreted in many ways It is fascinating how this movie has only four main characters but the clever writing makes it interesting and unique What I love about the fact is that a movie about obsession jealousy is done in such a light hearted manner It has a very fast pace which is probably the reason why it can appeal to a large audience The main character Max has shades of grey and I felt the ending was perfect I dont think he is supposed to be a clean character considering the fact he is searching for his long lost love while he is engaged and he also has a fling with Alice The character of Alice is even worse Her manipulation and her compulsive lying can really irritate viewersthat is the point I guess The scene where she breaks down in front of Lucien really shows another facet of her character It shows a side of her that wants to be accepted and that she is tired of all the lying and the games and she wants to lead a normal life In the end she understands that she needs to get away from it all The ending lends a cynical touch Because it seems as if Maxs love for Alice is temporary and fake It is as if to say that love in general is a temporary emotion and it is better to choose the safe optionie Muriel than to pursue something that is so fleetingie Lisa or Alice In many ways this is not really a romantic movie but a satire about romancein a way The performances deserve high praise Vincent Cassel as Max gives a great performance He perfectly portrays the confusion of a man who is not really sure about his engagement His geeky looks are an added advantage as it fits the character perfectly But the real star of the movie is Romane Bohringer as Alice Her nuanced portrayal of a woman who is jealous of Alice and is in love with Max The scene where she screams I am a nutcase too really shows her desperation and her yearning to live a normal life with a man who loves her Btw I also thought lesbianism is another interpretation that can be drawn from this movie Alices actions can be explained in many ways And her unreasonable obsession with Lisa may also be explained as a manifestation of a lesbian desire It may be farfetched considering she encourages Lisa to forgive her current boyfriend But I got the feeling that she was a lesbian for a long time She also avoids questions from Lisa regarding a boyfriend She spends a whole lot of time with Lisa and she is happy during that time That may lead many to question her sexual orientation Overall I would give it a 910 I think it deserves it but I subtracted one because of the rewatchability factor I think it is a perfect movie otherwise
1,This movie was really well written and was very entertainingThere was great acting in it too Luke Perry did a very convincing job like he always doesIf you are looking for a eventful movie to watch this should be at the top of your list There is a mixture of comedy drama and action You can literally feel what the actors are feeling at points I was very impressed by this movie The special effects were very well done The whole movie was very convincing This movie is one of my favorites What happens is North America could be torn apart and Jack and his team have to try and to stop an eruption by destroying North America It was a very cool and creative idea I loved this movie and i know you will too
1,By now the games stale right The jokes have been done Its all over The creative genius which drove this game for the first two games was gone after all Wrong The game is still intact the jokes are here folks Sure theyre all rehash but so was Monkey Island 2 And 1 for that matter The difficulty is well placed somewhere between the slightly easy 1 and the ridiculously hard 2 The ship fighting subgame is badly innappropriate in the tradition of subgames And this game has the best joke of the whole series When asked for your membership card to an exclusive beach always select You dont need to see my identification Its worth the price of the game by itself
1,This film by the wellknown Czech director and writer collaborator Petr Jarchovský is remarkable for its particularity but annoying and distracting in its details Taking its theme and title from a Robert Graves poem it deals with a woman with several men and some obnoxious relatives in her life whos trying to survive and protect her two children 15yearold Lucina Michaela Mrvikova and little blond asthmatic Kuba Adam MisikThe poem is much in evidence but the themeit gets a little lost Marcela Anna Geislerová the Beauty and Jarda Roman Luknár have lost everything in the Prague floods of 2002 and have nothing left it seems but good sex which they go at with such a vengeance in their tiny apartment that Lucina and Kuba in front of the telly must hold their ears against the noise Hrebejek relishes such explicitness and skates on the edge of embarrassment or shock Theres no good explanation precisely why but financial desperation has led Jarda to processing stolen cars in the big garage that adjoins his flatlet His carthief cohort drives off a posh Volvo the easygoing Benes Josef Abrham has left with the keys in the ignition while visiting a large property he owns Benes is a supernice guy but no fool His Volvo is wired for tracking by satellite in cases like this and that leads the cops straight to Jardas garage and he and his cohort are off to jail Beauty in trouble flees to the good angelOn whom she can rely begins the Graves poem But actually this fracas leads Benes to Marcela when he meets her at the police station He introduces her to sushi and how to drink wine and plies her with a picture book about Tuscany where he though Pragueborn owns a lovely villa and has lived most of his life Hes here to reclaim the house in Prague now occupied by a couple with an ancient and infirm mother whom he allows to remain Benes every gesture is benevolent even though he doesnt prevent Jarda from going off to jail In the circumstances Marcela must retreat with Lucina and Kuba to depend on the charity of her mother Zdena Jana Brejchova and the far less tender mercies of Zdenas present husband the scrawny diabetic Richard Hrstka Jiri Schmitzerwho for the kids starting when they commit the cardinal sin of consuming his dietetic cookies proves to be the uncle from hell Jiri Schmitzer hijacks the film at this point and never quite lets it go Even in the final scene he is a figure of leering menace It is surprising that the obnoxious Richard doesnt sexually abuse one or both of the children He is insistent that Marcela needs to get out on her own and when Benes offers to take her under his wing he and Richard become improbable allies Improbableperhaps implausible Why should Benes like him But then what is Beness whole story About some things the film gives too much information and about others not enough  Clearly the good angel Benes is infallibly kindand a polished goodlooking older man whose manners befit his Italian upbringing Its only at the end when hes pushed to the limits over his Prague property by the devious occupants he proves that he is not one to wont lie down and be walked over  Also to be dealt with is Jardas religious fanatic mother Sdena Jana Brejchova and her interactions with Zdena and Richard are something to watch But she is just another wild card that does not augment the deck  The poem has been set to music in a Czech translation and is sung on screen by the accordionistvocalist Raduza first in a tiny scene then in a more extended one staged at a prison performance witnessed by Jarda and the car thief pal If you revere Hrebejk as an auteur you may relish this sequence otherwise it tends to feel gratuitous Also included are a number of songs by Glen HansardMarketa Irglova of the Oscarawardwinning Irish musical film Once including the latters theme song Falling They feel more out of place than they would otherwise because of their familiarity from Oncethough this film came first Hrebejks people are arresting even little Koba has his Shakespeareanchild moments and a wealth of charm but the director and his writer seem unable to resist the temptation to digress and to overexpand The property hassle Benes endures may be useful for showing he has a tough side But such an elaborate demonstration wasnt necessary The acting is fine and there is a wonderful with quirkiness and specificity but the basic themes of love sex and money get lost in the shuffle and Marcelas conflicts and how she resolves them never become clear Its fine that there is no resolution and true to the theme and to Gravess poem that Marcela still has hot sex with Jarda during a revisit to Prague after moving to Tuscany with Benes and her kids But there are too many questions remaining about what to make of the obnoxious Richard or of Jardas annoyingly pious mother Emília Vásáryová How come all of a sudden we learn Koba is getting letters from India purported to be from his dad whos in prison When did that come about Interesting details hastily pasted in This seems a world in which you cant see the forest for the trees
1,The numbers dont lie 109 people have voted for this film That says a great deal about the standing of one of the most intuitively insightful comedians of the late 20th century And for those of you who know the work of Bill Hicks if he were alive today imagine what he would have to say about the boy president from his home state That his short career remains unrecognized is a sad situation and this film or rather these two films explain why First you see how his talent was obvious from the start again and again those who knew Bill Hicks always say he was not only funny he was also unique The film also shows how the quality of his material was too challenging for many in the entertainment industry His drinking also contributed to his career problems but that is less evident in this film And then the second film is a complete performance If you have never seen or heard Bill Hicks this is a wonderful introduction to the person and his dark but intelligent humor Especially due to the fact that the topics are now almost 14 years old yet remain ironically up to date is underlined by the fact that many of the events took place under the first President Bush Watching them together  first the biography and then the performance  makes you aware of how greatly talented this young man was how quickly his life passed and how the American media can sometimes act as the great big homogenizer Lets make sure nothing is too provocative nothing will be too interesting And the result Well as the man himself said go to sleep America your government is in control In his lifetime at least in Great Britian this artist was recognized for his talent and was successful there 11 years after his death 109 people at IMDb can say something about the film After youve seen them both I hope you understand why more people should be listening to Bill Hicks
1,Great adaptation of the Christie novel Surprising attention to authentic period details for the time Many films of the mid1970searly 80s that try to do 1920searly 30s look far too mid70searly 80s for my liking so expected the worst here and was gladly proved wrongThe costumes and sets are very well done I liked this production very much  largely due to the adorable Francesca Annis portrayal of a carefree bright young Lady Frankie and James Warwicks charming Bobbie The pair would go on to portray Christies Tommy  Tuppence which is funny as some contemporary book critics compared Frankie and Bobby to her earlier characters of Tommy  Tuppence The supporting characters were equally well done  the over the top Mrs Rivington acted by Miss Marpletobe Joan H and Badger is played perfectly as the post WWI Bertie Wooster type
1,If you like your films to pull your emotions out of you if you like your films with a guy you can root for and relate to if you like your films in black and white you gotta see this film Watch it from start to finish because you dont want to miss a beat It is sometimes slow and it makes you wonder when something is going to happen then when the plot begins to unfold you will be on the edge of your seat I know I was My Mother told me about this film as our family had some of the same things going on in it as the film does We loved Frankie who plays the lead convincingly What ever you think about Frank Sinatra put that aside in the film he is skinny and he doesnt sing so keep an open mind For the era it was made in it tells a story that is still being told today in homes all across the nation and quite possibly the world Please watch if you like older films give this one a try
1,THE FALCON AND THE SNOWMAN is a superb example of an anti80s film While many other films of the decade in general lacked substance this film is pure substance Theres nothing stylish or fake or superfluous about it It boasts two superb performances Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn as lifelong friends Christopher Boyce and Daulton Lee respectively Hutton Penn and Tom Cruise were a triumvirate of early 80s actors who all looked headed to much bigger and better things all 3 starred in TAPS While Penn and Cruises popularity soared Hutton has been largely forgotten about and thats a shame Actually Hutton is the first of the 3 to win an Oscar for supporting role in ORDINARY PEOPLE in 1980 but I think his performance in this movie is even more outstanding Hutton really captures the postVietnam war rebelliousness in his character Chris Boyce A failed seminary school student Chris has a lovehate relationship with his father well played by the great character actor Pat Hingle The scene where Chris quotes the poem his father thought hed long forgotten is a particularly powerful one Chris gets job at Dept of Defense and uses his hatred of US govt and its foreign policy to sell seemingly useless plans of old projects to the Soviets He gets his buddy Daulton a hyper drugdealing selfserver in on it to be the courier of the project plans on microfilm While Chris is doing it based on his beliefs Daulton is doing it strictly for the money The Soviet liaison is excellently played by David Suchet Penn and Suchet have a real quirky chemistry and its a kind of funny set of exchanges between them But make no mistake this film is anything but that It is a serious character study about pessimism malaise paranoia and mistrust Again the leads make this film Hutton delivers a brilliantly understated performance as Chris a rather smart young man who had so much potential Penn as usual does a tremendous characterization as Daulton a pathetic loser who acts before he thinks and most of the time doesnt think at all The ending of this factbased film is very saddening on several levels A truly powerful character study
1,If you believe that any given war movie can make you really feel the war you need to see Letyat zhuravli called The Cranes are Flying in English It tells the story of Veronika Tatiana Samoylova and Boris Aleksey Batalov who are in love on the verge of WWII They are walking along the waterfront watching the cranes fly by when the war starts Boris is promptly sent off to war Veronika hides out with a family and ends up marrying the son whom she does not love Boris meanwhile continues trotting through the countryside fighting the Nazis and experiencing all the horrors of war until he he runs out of energy When Veronika  working in a military hospital  receives this news she refuses to accept it until Boris body arrives home on one of the trains Simultaneously the radio announces that Germany has surrendered and the Allied Powers have won the war the Soviet Union lost 27 million citizens but its the start of a new era This movie did a very good job showing the human impact of the war not only in the battlefield but also how it affected the civilian population This is definitely a movie that everyone should see
1,Drive was an enjoyable episode with a dark ending Basically a man and his wife are infected in their inner ear by a high pitched sound wave being emitted by some military equipment Some favorite parts of mine from this episode are Mulders dialogue in the car and the scene where Scully goes in with the Hazmat team and find the little old deaf lady completely unaffected by what they thought was a virus The ending of course is tragic in its realism because it leads the viewer to believe that they are going to actually be able to pull off this elaborate plan to save the victim but when Mulder arrives the man is already dead 810
1,The hurried approach that Lewis Seiler takes with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot while still maintaining an efficient runtime One of the clearest examples of this is the transition between poverty and wealth for the married medical couple The audience is instantly transported from a shanty medical office to a luxurious suite at the citys most prestigious inn This development is critical to understanding the position the doctors have been thrown into The story suggests from the intro that these two people are generally happy with providing medical practice to those who are less fortunate By abruptly cutting from this scenario to the morally conflicting occupation the mobs personal physician the viewer is called upon to experience this sudden turn of events The Nelsons Kay Francis and John Eldredge are forcibly employed by Gurney Bogart without objections This stylized notion of organized crime being too influential and powerful to overcome has become a standard component in every gangster picture The one aspect of this film that raised some questions for me ironically dealt with the pacing of the story and that rate at which it was told I think that character development and social identity can suffer when certain aspects of a story are not fully examined This paradox happens to be a result of personal taste in that I think that the movie going experience can be enhanced through rigorous character development However for the purposes of this film I must admit that the rapid action contributes more dynamic flare to the impact of the film 12 of 
1,Tia Carrere was the reason I decided to watch this film as neither the title nor the cover would have been enough to make me spend my time and money on this film  which goes to show me and everyone that a DVD shouldnt be judged by its cover SPOILERS The film felt like it was trundling along not really going anywhere for the moment  the awkwardness of Paul Faber Zak Orth around girls being almost too embarrassing to watch and the fringe on the otherwise attractive Kirsten Beck as Alexondra Lee being too schoolgirlish to watch Where those really fashionable in 1995 The relationship between Vicky Mueller Tia Carrere and Todd Boomer Jason London was tantalising from the start of though That first meeting across the lake  magical What a beautiful coincidence they should meet again just as he has behaved like a complete moron Boomer with two Os as in moron in front of Alexondra A shame really that we as the audience knew who Vicky Mueller really was Well the title did give that away wouldnt you think What really surprised me was the acting Especially in the scene where Vicky gives Todd a metal version of his alter ego the dog character in the little white jewellery box The actors really managed to recreate that tingling sensation of a first kiss  point of no return for Todd and Vicky A shame really that the film ends with focus on after getting over Todds fathers Harvard drive his reuniting with his friends I could envision a whole new film  following Vicky to New York  there must be a good art University there that Todd could attend Nevertheless a film that does just what we want Hollywood to entertain us for the duration of the film Did anyone else notice how none of the loves are happy ones in this film Todds mother is slightly insane on the phone 247 his Dad doesnt find her attractive any more Todds teacher obviously is disenchanted by his wife and vice versa  Todd himself enters into a wonderfully erotic  daring relationship which however nice it may be would realistically be very difficult to maintain age difference maturity difference etc and Alexondra  Zak do not get together because Alexondra is not mature enough to handle a relationship  her reactions towards the condom the cheating Zaks advances etc are all very immature and often involve running away and Zak himself the poor guy  is too much of a best friendlike a brotherguy to pull even Alexondra Mind you good film though I gave it an 810 Brilliant performance by the actors  who bring the script to life
1,Early 80s creature feature concerns a long abandoned gold mine that some intrepid miners are determined to check out Naturally they find no gold down there but one very hungry monster that slithers along in search of prey While I have to be honest and admit I found it dull at first I personally prefer the thematically similar The Boogens it actually grew on me as it went along Now the characters arent too interesting nor the actors either The closest to an interesting character is Morgan played by Keith Hurt In any event female lead Terri Berland is quite good looking and Rolf Theison makes his domineering jerk an easy person to hate The writer played by effects man Mark Sawicki wears thin quickly It begins in a comfortably predictable enough way with a nighttime set piece in which two victims are claimed to get things off to an acceptable start The monster itself is intriguing for its design as you can imagine it gets revealed a bit at a time until late in the game and for being the product of stop motion animation when this process was no longer used very much Director Melanie Anne Phillips directing under the pseudonym of David Michael Hillman and crew deserve some credit for their creation of atmosphere They manage to make the film look quite claustrophobic and gloomy and their use of lighting works well The film does build in intensity towards a pretty good ending Suffice it to say they do the best they can on their low budget An obscure little item worth looking into for diehard horror buffs 710
1,This game has cartoon graphics not much violence and really short levels  then why do people say it is so brilliant Because it always holds your attention it captivates you and refuses to let go You will try for hours to try and find that damn flight recorder try to work out how to get into the room without alerting the guards etc The levels are short only when you know what to do  until that you will spend hours trying to figure out where to find correspondences where to find helicopters and so on And youll have fun all the while you are doing it Well worth a rent
1,I must admit at first I was worried about Farscape The opening segment was not very strong and I began to worry about what was to come However once it set in to familiar Henson territory with the wry sense of humor the unique and enduring characters and the compelling story combined to create an excellent piece of science fiction The story follows John Crichton played by Ben Browder a scientist who has developed a spaceship and theory that rely on slingshot propulsion However during the first test his craft encounters an unknown magnetic field and he is propelled into an unknown galaxy where he finds himself in the middle of a struggle between escaping prisoners on the starship Moya and the Peacekeepers human enforcers He is quite literally drawn into the prisoners ship and after many twists and turns finds himself united with the prisoners Ka Dargo a Luxom warrior PaU Zhaan a Delvian priestess Rygel XVI a deposed ruler and Aeryn Sun a Peacekeeper who has reluctantly joined the crew With excellent special effects moderate makeup and puppets and robots that exceed the Henson standard of perfection as well as a very well written story and character driven plot FarScape looks to be a fantastically original creative and clever science fiction series
1,I saw this movie on PBS the first time Then I bought the video and watched it countless times Every time I watch it I can get something else out of it Its a real testament to wanting to hold onto a life that was good but now the world is changing But you dont have to be older to hold onto the past even the young characters like Charlotte dont want things to change The overall tone and mood is excellent The cast is outstanding with allstars like Kathy Bates Beau Bridges and Arthur Kennedy And its fun to see the upcoming stars before they hit more recognizable feature films like Kevin J OConnor The Mummy and Vincent DOnofrio Men in Black and Law  Order Criminal Intentone of my favorite shows Its just one of those movies that stays with you
1,With all the dreck out there this is a gentle movie about young love Yes its true that young love often makes more out of something than it deserves but why arent people down on Romeo and Juliet Paul and Michelle are models of good behave compared to them Yes they run away and set up an ideal life but this is a movie not real life Paul is more sexually interested than Michelle who has been come onto in a bad way Eventually they have sex but no one is forced into it The movie does let kids know that sex can cause babies One thing there is nudity in the movies The camera does not focus on it but it is there The ending of the movie has Paul in good chance of being found out In Paul and Michelle they separate for a time If you dont like the ending of a movie think one up yourself Alternative endings are not just for DVDs
1,Im not going to go into too much depth but Showtime was a pretty funny movie There wasnt any slappingyourknee funny scenes that I can remember but it had its moments The cast is pretty good Robert De Niro is good as usual and Eddie Murphy pulls off a pretty funny performance Rene Russo was just fine in the film no complaints there There were two characters in the story that I liked that they didnt explain much at all The first one was Trey Sellars Eddie Murphys buddy at the gym played by Ken Campbell I supposed he was just a friend of Treys but I wanted to know more about him The other character that I liked was Mitch Prestons Robert De Niros fellow coppartner played by Nestor Serrano I guess he was just another cop working with Mitch Preston but I wanted to know if he was his partner or what not I think maybe Im putting too much thought into a movie I mean after all its a comedywho cares about the characters I guess I do though I was really pleased to see this was directed by Tom Dey who also directed Shanghai Noon Ever since I saw that movie I was looking forward to his next work I think he did a pretty good job with this film and I again look forward to his next work All in all it was a good movie but I wouldnt recommend paying full price for a ticket unless youre a diehard Robert De NiroEddie MurphyRene Russo fan It was worth seeing in the theater but not for full price Id recommend seeing it at matinee price  Also heres some movie trivia for ya The guy who played the camera man played by Judah Friedlander is the guy in the music video Everyday by Dave Matthews band He was also the clerk in Meet The Parents also starring Robert De Niro And on top of that he also played Derek Zoolanders brother in Zoolander both Zoolander and Meet the Parents star Ben Stiller Just some useless trivia for ya I hope you enjoy the film Thanks for reading Chris
1,Contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an against the system type of movie and attitude It is an excellent portrayal of the system in question and how ridiculous it truly is The funny parts in the movie are in fact funny because they speak the truth about the world around us Anyone who finds this movie to be unrealistic is simply denying the self evident truths about life And that is to learn what you enjoy That is what college should be about I come to find that a comment must have at least 10 lines I think I have given my opinion on the matter So I now write a couple more lines just as filler I hope you have been entertained during this time I encourage you to go see the movie It is well worth your while so long as you follow it and immerse yourself in the movie
1,Spending an hour seeing this brilliant Dan Finnerty and his Dan Band perform their special on Bravo is the most enjoyable hour Ive ever spent watching TV This young man Dan is such an incredible talent as a singer performer and even dancer He can go from the cheesiest of ballad pop songs all of which have only been sung by women to hiphop rock also songs written for women This guy can do anything Ive seen him live at least 11 times so I was not expecting just how well that his show would adapt to a television or film format but all reservations went away instantly when the show started because of Dans overwhelming star qualityDo yourself a favor and watch this or better yet buy it
1,Great film No gratuitous gimmicks like in most Hollywood films Everything supported the suspense of the plot Bw gave it a basic nofrills feel also In short it was visceral in its simplicity of cinematography and cast Following serves as an interesting contrast to Memento Characters in both used manipulation and subterfuge extensively In that sense both reminded me somewhat of In the Company of Men also highly recommendable One difference between Nolans two films is that Memento was a little easier for me to follow given that the bw scenes progress in a constant chronological direction and so do those in color I dont think that was true of Following where scenes seemed to be shown at random If you have the choice between VCR and DVD Id highly recommend DVD since that gives you the option of watching the movie a second time in chronological order not just in the scrambled albeit ingenuous order presented by Nolan It also makes it easier upon a second viewing to piece the order together for yourself if you want to As another viewer noted one of the best things about both this movie and Memento is that none of the cast were famous They were characters not bigname actors who brought in personas developed in other movies Given certain similarities in the plots I wonder if Memento is sort of a remake of Following but intended to reach a bigger audience like Edward Burns made Shes the One in the mold of  and with largely the same cast as  The Brothers McMullan
1,More maybe is mostly remembered for the excellent soundtrack composed by Pink Floyd in 1969 they werent superstars yet Actually they made an album with the film music no fan can miss it But this is also the first film of GermanFrench director Barbet Schroeder its a cult movie When it was released censorship everywhere cut several scenes of sex and drugs It is also one of the first films to treat explicitly the theme of drug slavery A German boy travels to Paris and meets an American girl they fall in love Together they search for sun and exoticism But its a too high price love she initiates him into drugs In the Sixties antidrug campaigns were not like today there wasnt much information On the contrary in many milieus taking drugs was a sort of spiritual experience So its quite surprising to see a film of that period which describes a nightmarish heroin experience The film is simple not vulgar at all and shot in a cinemaverité style Actors Mimsy Farmer and Klaus Grünberg are very convincing More is a document of the end of the Sixties and a document of the end of the hippies illusions as well
1,THE KING OF QUEENS in my opinion is a pure CBS hit Despite the fact that Ive never seen every episode I still enjoy it very much For that reason its hard for me to say which episode is my favorite Even so I must say that CBS really knows how to make a good sitcom Before I wrap this up Id like to say that everyone always gives a good performance the production design is spectacular the costumes are welldesigned and the writing is always very strong In conclusion if this show lives on in syndication after it goes off CBS I strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good
1,This film was a huge surprise to me while i watched it at Cinequest in the big California Theatre in San Jose Its a musical which normally I dont like but I have to say this one was different Robert Peters who directed the film and stared in it did such a wonderful job During his Q  A he told the audience that he only had two other people for his crew Most of the dialouge was made up on the fly and he actually made the film while attending another film festival in Germany I cant say enough great things about this movie the only bad thing is that you really tend to notice the camera work and it shakes a bit If you happen to come across this film check it out
1,Good dramacomedy with two good performances from Hunter  Hurt but Albert Brooks steals every scene he is in With a great script this movie soars and gives everyone a chance to show their acting talent And although Joan Cusack is not in this much but she has one if not the funniest scene in the movie The highlight of the movie for me was Albert Brooks speech on the devil Only one draw back is the fact it goes little slow in places And I only got totally interested in Brooks role not so much in Hunters or Hurts I give this a 7 out of 10
1,The Stepford Children besides being a very good made for TV movie shows the very disturbing result of indoctrination It is quite a statement about how being made to act within the confines of what is considered Good behavior can destroy whatever it is that makes a person unique and an individual I think that this is a movie that parents who want to maintain some semblance of the thought that loams within the hearts and minds of youngsters should watch with their children and discuss what the movie is saying I dont know if that was in any way the intent of this movie but I have always been of the opinion that it is one of the best movie devices against the wish to have children conform to an unrealistic and domineering pretense of what is in the best interest of anyone other than that of the children themselves I hope to one day see this movie on DVD I am at the starting gate waiting
1,This working girls go to hell soap is a time capsule candidate courtesy of its immaculate physical production 50s costuming look at all those bows and pearls creamy Johnny Mathis theme song and ohso daring for its time sexual attitudes Rona Jaffes novel on which the film was based keeps on being republished and just a few years ago Vanity Fair actually devoted an article to this delectable bon bon of a movie Take a look at the new DVD transfer and youll know why The three leads  Hope Lange Diane Baker and Suzy Parker  echo the girls from How to Marry A Millonaire or Carrie Bradshaw and her friends from Sex and the City Gentlewomen songsters off on a spree Their romantic adventures and sexual entanglements are the stuff of paperback passion empty caramel corn calories devoid of nutrition impossible to resist snacking on Lange is genuinely touching in her neoGrace Kelly way Baker is properly dim and idealistic as a timid virgin who gets gasp knocked up by a hiss cad It helps that the cad is played by Robert Evans the throaty voiced coke snorting film mogul who surely has lead many an innocent young lamb to the slaughter in his Beverly Hills bedroom Suzy Parker is fascinating in the first half of the film all blithe self assurance and knowing remarks She struts her stuff with the panache of the fashion icon she was in the 50s Alas shes not up to where the film sends her into madness and obsession But she exudes glamour and savior faire and her acting is at least adequate One wonders why the critics loathed her virtually driving her out of movies a few years later Perhaps an aloof attitude on the part of a good looking woman is just too much to bear It sank Ali McGraws career a generation later and when you think of it Ali McGraw and Suzy Parker were basically the same actress The films only major flaw is a weak ending It pretty much collapses into a romantic swoon at the end rather than rising to a wham bang melodramatic finish like the other famous soap opera from producer Jerry Wald Peyton Place which had Lana Turner weeping and gnashing her teeth during a rape trial Here Hope Lange wanders out onto the New York sidewalk spots burly eternally hung over but now of course sober Stephen Boyd and they simply walk off togetherinto the sunset one presumes Otherwise this is pretty much the definition of a guilty pleasure Oh Yestheres also Joan Crawford breathing fire at all the young girls and smoking cigarettes while she hisses to her married lover over the phone And the titles are done in hot pink with ribbon lettering that recalls the department store ads of the late 50s Dont miss
1,Hardware Wars is a hilarious 12 minute short film parody of the original Star Wars movie which was released just a few months after Star Wars in 1977 This film uses household appliances as space ships and Star Wars lookalike actors to send you rolling around on the floor in uncontrollable fits of laughter This film has won many awards at film festivals and was the film which inspired Mel Brooks to write his Star Wars parody movie called Spaceballs This is my favorite parody film and I recommend it to anyone who is familiar with Star Wars and has a good sense of humor 
1,This film really used its locations well with some amazing shots dark and disturbing the film moves very slowly but constantly keeps you watching Modern Love worked well in the Gold Coast Film Fantastic program this year offering audiences a glimpse at an Australian Cinema that is usually neglected Most importantly it is refreshing to see Australian cinema not taking on the cliché Aussie characters and story lines we have seen done to death over the years This film would compliment any festival and will open debate after its screenings The performances and characters are well developed and the cinematography is fantastic An interesting exploration into family relationships and environments
1,This is a surprisingly great low budget HorrorComedy its funny and pretty well made with good performances and a really cool twist ending All the characters are pretty cool and the story while unoriginal is very good plus Eric JungmannAdam and Justin UrichHarley had fantastic chemistry together One of the funniest moments in the film for me is when Adam is trapped in the bathroom and Harley wakes up to find that monster truck sitting there and decides to take a pss in the truck and Aimee Brooks is just plain sexy plus this is one of the best low budget Horror films I have seen in a long time Its very gory but in a comical way and I thought it was very well written as well plus Michael Bailey Smith is fantastic as the Monster Man and had some wicked makeup Its similar to films like Joy Ride Duel Jeepers Creepers etc etc and it has some suspenseful moments here and there plus The gore effects are really well done for the most part This is a surprisingly great low budget HorrorComedy its funny and pretty well made with good performances and a really cool twist ending I highly recommend this one The Direction is very good Michael Davis does a very good job here with great camera work good anglesgood use of colors and using a great setting plus he kept the film funny and at a very fast pace There is a lot of gore We get extremely bloody nose bleedsgory impalings bloody stabbingsguy is cut in half by a monster truck human remains in a cooked stew guts all over the placeguys guts fall outpencil in the eyesbloody slit throatbunch of people walking around without limbsgory dead squirrelheads are squishedsevered limbsbloody and mangled corpsesdecent amount of bloodshedone very gory scene at the very end and more The Acting is very good for a low budget film Eric Jungmann is fantastic here as Adam he was a nerd but a very likable one he had fantastic chemistry with Justin Urich had some cool linesand I just loved his character he also seemed to be enjoying himselfand he was especially good at the end Justin Urich is excellent as the ass of a Best Friend however I just couldnt help but love him as he was very funny and often stole a lot of the scenes I really dug him Aimee Brooks is gorgeous and did great with what she had to do she had good chemistry with Jungmann and like Jungmann was especially good at the end as I loved her mysterious character Michael Bailey Smith is wonderful as The Monster Man he was very creepy looking had some awesome makeup and is now one of my favorite slashers Rest of the cast do fine Overall I highly recommend this one 12 out of 5
1,I have been hooked on GG since midway through 20012002 2nd season when I tuned in to see Smallville 10 minutes early Thanks to Beginnings I now have all but 2 episodes on tape right up through last night Ep 49 I am a middleaged straight male and this is the ONLY weekly TV show I watch  I love this series because a Lauren Graham is a damn finelooking woman and funny and smart to boot b the dialogue is extremely wellwritten c it is flatout hilarious putting overrated garbage like Everybody Loves Raymond to shame Many current TV comedies have been heavily influenced by the highly successful and muchdespised slimepit known as Married with Children where the viewer is encouraged to deride and feel superior to the characters In GG the characters have faults but we can see our own foibles in them and laugh with them not at them This is stimulating TV where the writers challenge us to keep up with rapidfire exchanges and outofleftfield popcultureliteraturecurrent events references I get immense pleasure out of watching these episodes over and over again catching all the oneliners and references to previous episodes Stars Hollow is its own little world one that I will happily continue to visit as long as the series runs
1,Snap crackle pop The jarring sound of every change in camera angle And thats not to mention the white flashes and the clipped endings to almost every spoken sentence What on earth were they up to in the editing room Or could it be that this approach was intentional Surely not What purpose could it serve Despite all its technical shortcomings this is an interesting film depicting a day in the life of Joe a hustler determined to earn 200 for his wifes pregnant girl friend Joe Dallesandro is outstanding as the easygoing passive laidback young man who is willing to let the other person do most of the talking while he listens with a faraway look in his eyes The story is meagre and sketchy documenting the uncertain life led by a man who relies on casual street sex to support his young wife and baby One thing is certain Joe is uninhibited when it comes to disrobing for sex or posing for an artist Understandably so for he has a handsome face and and equally handsome body There is a scene in the film that is remarkably effective There is no sound no dialogue Joe stark naked is crouching on the floor feeding crumbs of cake to his little baby There is a beautiful serenity and tenderness captured in these quiet moments Another scene of amusing interest is the one in which Joe desperately seeks a loan of 100 from a gym friend coming to the point of asking in a very circuitous approach Joe tries to look interested but is hesitant in his conversation when an artist gives him a nonstop resume of Greek and Roman art Its a preliminary to another occasion when Joe divests himself of his clothes and poses as the discus thrower in true classical style At the end of the film we gain the impression that we have got to know Joe pretty well After all he has uncovered more than his soul
1,Ingrid Bergman Cleo Dulaine has never been so beautiful Gary Cooper as Cleent so perfectly cast as a laconic Texan who knows this gal is up to no good When the two lock eyes at the French Market we know this match will be full of sparks When they stroll in her garden in her restored French Quarter house and the love theme plays it is a dream for all us romantics The costumes are lovely the set decoration makes you wish the Quarter was just that way And that Saratoga still had that hotel with the wide veranda with all the old biddies gossiping From Edna Ferbers novel the story is of revenge for old wrongs and the fights over who would run the railroads in the early days of that industry In the Saratoga scenes Florence Bates as a grand dame steals every scene But it is the scene of Cleo taking on the little lawyer her New Orleans relatives have sent to buy her off that is a Magic Movie Moment After Cleo has bested him in the negotiations he looks at her with longing and says may I say  you are verybeautiful And Cleo with a happy wicked smile says yes isnt it lucky You want to shout YES One of my all time favorite romantic films
1,Ive already seen spinoffs of cartoons such as The Flintstones Scooby Doo Tom and Jerry and Looney Tunes and most of them are great When I saw the All Grown Up pilot in 2001 I thought it was interesting to see how the Rugrats would look in their preteensteens and it contained things that would usually happen during that time of life such as going to a concert going to school and being grounded The actual TV show is better because the Rugrats seem to wear different clothes in each episode and Angelica doesnt get punished as much as she did in the original Rugrats series Tommy and Susie get punished in this series Ive also noticed references to Rugrats in this show and even flashbacks of how the Rugrats looked in the original series They actually talk to the adults in this show because theyre 10 years older This show is aimed at a slightly older audience than the original Rugrats Viewers of the original show may like this
1,Set in Paris in the year 1910 a retired old rich opera singer decides to give her fortune away to her beautiful cat Duchess  voiced by Eva Gabor and her kittens but the jealous butler Edgar comes up with a plan as he kidnaps the cats and leaves them in the countryside Luckily for them with the help of a streetwise and independent tomcat named Thomas OMalley  voiced by Phil Harris helps them get home especially meeting some of his good friends like the swinging Scat Cat  voiced by Scatman Crothers and try to foil Edgars plans Very entertaining and edgy postWalt Disneys death animated movie with a couple of nice jazzy tunes like the memorable Everybody wants to be a cat good voice acting and some terrific animation for its time even in these times of computer animation Not one of the greatest Disney animated movies but a cult Disney animated fave and one of the few gems of its day that works well highly recommended
1,The late Director John Frankenheimer directed his first feature film The Young Stranger after starting out directing live television dramas in New York City This film came on the heels of the success of Rebel Without A Cause in 1955 James MacArthur made his feature film debut as a troubled teen with a movie producer father played by James Daly who doesnt establish enough of a relationship with his son Kim Hunter plays the mother who tries to bridge the gap between her husband and her son The film uses the popular juvenile delinquent angle of the time to tell its story MacArthur gets in trouble at a movie theater with an overzealous theater manager played by Whit Bissell MacArthur in turn has to deal with a police sergeant James Gregory bent on teaching him a lesson The material could easily have turned exploitative laughable and sensational like any number of others of the period did However under the surehanded direction of Frankenheimer the film is a sensitive portrayal of teenage and parental dynamics The dialog is realistic and most of the scenes hold up surprisingly well Some of the scenes with Bissell as the theater manager and Gregory as the police sergeant are a bit heavyhanded and dated The performances are uniformly good though which is necessary for a film of this nature and about this topic to succeed This is an impressive feature film debut both for MacArthur and Frankenheimer  of 4 stars
1,Although its definitely an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours and its always worth a watch this film never quite meets the targets that it should for two reasons Firstly after the first fortyfive minutes or so it focuses heavily on Helen and Johnny who are far less interesting characters than most of the others  Janet Jennifer George and Miss Scattergoods are all much more enticing Although at first this works since in life we dont always know everything about everyone else and because the point is being made that perhaps Helen is slightly selfinvolved it quickly wears thin and we want to see more of the other characters Secondly the film seems to lose its way in terms of plot in the second half The letter itself holds far less significance than it does in the first half and again although this works well in some ways it seems odd to leave so much of the potential displayed in the first half behind Overall this film is sweet and goodnatured with some genuinely hilarious moments  for example Janet explaining condiments to an avid audience The lazy but quietly desperate atmosphere that Helen feels is heavy and the sense of living in a small seaside town is accurately portrayed but the film isnt quite as intelligent as its trying to be It just misses being both a light romantic comedy and being a clever portrait of life However its still good and if you get the chance its definitely worth seeing
1,Dolemite is a blaxploitation film about well Dolemite and his army of kung fu killer women led by Queen Bee He fights to get his club The Total Experience back from Willie Green by utilizing their kung fu abilities and their devotion to him I liked this movie because of the witty dialogue and also the use of Rudy Ray Moores ability to preach to his brothers in rhyme
1,Like many other commentators here I went in expecting a taste of music that would satisfy my curiosity  and got more than I asked for I heard and saw a powerful exquisite sometimes haunting sometimes touching lyrical sentimental in the truest way and absolutely stunning blend of music and musicians Reminded me a lot of some forms of Indian music East Indian but at the same time was very very different Starting from the the first track by Baba Zula to the Kurdish singer Aynur what a voice to Siyasiyabend to the jam session or Jugalbandhi  as we call it in India in the small Turkish bar ft Selim Seslar Big fan now   I enjoyed every minute and wished it wouldnt end One of the best music commentaries I have seen and heard in a long time  I am craving for a CD of the soundtrack and hope I can find it online somewhere soon and also for old and latest albums from Baba Zula A day later the music is still etched in my brain and I dont want it to go away Turkey and specifically Istanbul now seem such beautiful and exciting places  and I am going to start saving today to go take it in Faith Akin  this is a gem
1,Ordinarily Anthony Mann made westerns with the big guys  James Stewart Gary Cooper Henry Fonda    the A list cowboy stars But in this B film he tackled something notably different and had quite a bit of success with what turned out to be a truly one of a kind western The main character played by Victor Mature is a trapper mountain man and ordinarily they are romanticized in films  Robert Redford in Jeremiah Johnson that sort of thing where the hero is not in fact a typical mountain man but a clean cut heroic figure who hangs out with real mountain men Not here For once a true mountain man  vulgar crude animalistic  is the central figure and its something to see giving Mature one of his better later roles The real acting chops are provided by Robert Preston excellent as a selfabsorbed Custer type cavalry commander and James Whitmore the poor mans Spencer Tracy as another of those old timers who feel themselves trapped between ever more hostile Indians on the one side and the oncoming force of civilization on the other Even more impressive is a very young Anne Bancroft as the officers wife who is initially repulsed by the very sight of Matures grisly character then finds her own veneer of civilization slipping away as she begins to realize to her own shock that shes attracted to him Rarely if ever has a remote frontier fort been so accurately realized on screen without the romantic allure that John Ford gave such a place in his masterful Fort Apache The battle sequences are big scale and notably violent and particularly impressive if you seen them in widescreen format Good show and underrated movie all around
1,This film is bone chilling in a way that is hard to describe While it is fairly accurate in its description of the events leading up to and the subsequent investigation regarding the first attempt to destroy the World Trade Center in 1993 seen now post 911 it is almost unbearable It would be a mistake to call this film prophetic but it certainly makes the common playground wisdom of fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me come alive Our government learned nothing from the 1993 attempt on the World Trade Center and subsequent readings of the 911 Report show that many of the mistakes that led to the bombing in 1993 were repeated Some people have criticized the First and Fourth Amendments of the US Constitution as being partly responsible for the Islamic terrorists being able to carry out their evil plans but that is wrong headed in every possible way Surely the people making this argument are not supporting a ban on Free Speech a free press or freedom of religion I certainly hope they are not supporting our government officials being able to break into any persons home or office to search without cause or without a warrant The fact is the FBI the INS and even the local police could have gotten warrants based on the information they had in their possession but they chose not to for a variety of reasons Besides no matter how distasteful or ignorant it is it is not illegal to speak badly about America or its leaders Likewise it is not illegal to either own guns or to pray toward Mecca Consider this until Lee Harvey Oswald actually fired his rifle at President John Kennedy he wasnt really breaking any laws Living in a free society has its drawbacks Still Path To Paradise is a must see film that I am afraid will never be seen by that many people As far as I know it is not on DVD and 2007 is its tenth anniversary and there are no known revivals of it Im not really surprised people dont like to document their failures and this film certainly shows that the various agencies that were supposed to protect us did not do their jobs right and for the pettiest of reasons like jurisdictional squabbles and a refusal to share information This is a shame as Path To Paradise is well done and gripping and as many have stated before the final scene where Ramzi Yousef played by Art Malik the bomber who built the truck bomb that was used in the first attempt at destroying the two towers is flying past the World Trade Center after his capture and extradition simply says Next time we will bring them both down is a film moment that froze me in place for several minutes
1,Forget all those people who tell you its not as good as the book So what This is a film after all It is a sheer joy to watch made entirely on location in Cephallonia gorgeous photography but with dark disturbing moments as well The only problem I have is with the obvious miscasting of Nicolas Cage as captain Corelli Apart from that the film was a very pleasant surprise
1,This is the Australian TV series It is a classic The stories and actors are excellent Who can forget Picker and his gramophone or Chet being ambushed This is cult TV The Australian actors in the series were the best of their day and have immortality in The Outsiders What can I say timeless adventure The music and song just fantastic The closing credits starting with the close up of the wheel then Keir sleeping n being jostled around and then the long shot just cannot get much better than that All 13 episodes are equally solid in the portrayal of the Australian myth and I think this is what this series hasIt does not matter that the two main characters were from overseas I think that is the key to the series and why it is so good
1,Now I am not prone to much emotion but I cried seeing this movie It certainly has more appeal among blacks than other ethnic groups but there is something here for everyone The classic song Its so Hard to Say Goodbye really makes this one worth watching at least once
1,This was the first Mickey Mouse cartoon released and the first cartoon with sound In the cartoon Mickey does not yet wear gloves He does not yet speak either All he does is whistle and play music The song that he plays is Turkey in the Straw using several farm animals as musical instruments For example he plays the teeth of a cow like a xylophone and pulls nursing piglets like an accordion keyboard I taped this cartoon off of the Disney Channel and I think it is wonderful It was based on a silent film starring Buster Keaton entitled Steamboat Bill Jr
1,This is definitely a movie that will make you think about the everyday struggles a person can go through every day Great acting by the two leading roles exemplifies this further and you will not regret seeing this movie in any way Its a heartwarming tale of two new friends exploring the ups and downs of everyday life seen from the seat of a wheelchair Their friendship is tested as well as their spirits when they get their own flat outside the nursing home I recommend this film to everyone who likes buddypictures or just wants to see a wonderful and heartwarming film that steers clear of all the clichés and pitfalls and not once gets soggy
1,Let me start by saying overall I enjoyed The Long Kiss Goodnight I would give it a 710 The Good 1 Acting Samuel L Jackson is entertaining in almost any role In this movie he doesnt play his usual character the type that is in control instead Geena Davis is in control and Sam is along for the ride His timing on his lines are great and he is the high point of the movie Geena Davis also gives a great preformance as Samantha CaineCharlie Baltimore She is a believable action hero and I dont think too many other actresses could pull off the preformance Geena Does 2 The Action This is a very action packed movie Things are pretty much always crashing or blowing up or someone is chasing someone else The special effects are pretty good especially for being almost 8 years old I can see some green screen stuff but it doesnt detract too much from the acting The Bad 1 Why did it take half of the movie to set up the plot This film needed to be edited in the script stage so that it didnt run as long as it did Maybe a drama or something can run this long but people really need to be into the movie the entire time to sustain it I think that if you can stick out the first half you will be pleseantly suprized the second half 2 Geena Davis is cold weather and a tank top but she never seems cold 3 Some things are unrealistic Sam Jackson flies through a giant sign after he is blasted out of a room and then he lands in a tree and just gets up When you see this part you will think its a gag overall fun movie 710
1,I have some of the older videos and dvds of Dr Who Ive played them over and over I adore each of the Doctors for different reasons But due to a man in the BBC hierarchy Dr Who was canceled even though it was still one of the mainstays of the BBC lineup With the departure of Sylvester McCoy the Doctor stayed alive through the fans BBC graciously allowed fans to write books and cartoons The momentum of Dr Who has been steady even after 1989 Then they took a chance with Paul McGann The movie was flawed but it gave the BBC an idea of what we wanted In 1999 the man was gone and the newbies at the BBC felt it was time to bring the Doctor back It was a complete success Here in America the Scifi Channel took a chance and it has become a complete success as well although the writers were having to start over and explain the Dr Who mythology for new viewers It is incredible to me that they have done it In Season 1 staring Christopher Eccleston with Russell T Davis as lead writer and Phil Collinson as producer the Doctor has come back to us and in each episode we learn more about who the Doctor is The Doctor Who universe has always been about Choice Love and Sacrifice This is what they provided It makes me want more and it saddens me that Mr Eccleston has chosen to leave the show My first Doctor was Doctor no 3 Jon Pertwees Doctor Mr Eccleston neednt worry about his position in the Dr Who universe It is as solid as the rest He is the 9th Doctor I didnt know of Mr Eccleston prior to his performance in Dr Who but I do now I wish there was some way he could know there is push out in the Dr Who fan community to find his other work and enjoy it We have already seen that he is a great actor
1,When Alfred Hitchcock made STRANGERS ON A TRAIN it was a harbinger for the bulk of the film going public that he was back at the top of his form From 1946 to 1950 his films were not box office successes and his contractual arrangement with David O Selznick ended because of this Actually he made some really good films in the period such as NOTORIOUS SPELLBOUND UNDER CAPRICORN ROPE and my opinion STAGESTRUCK But while NOTORIOUS AND SPELLBOUND were liked the audiences were turned off by Hitchs attempts at experimentation his use of a dream sequence by Salvator Dali in SPELLBOUND was acceptable as was the setting among psychiatrists But the experiment with long takes in ROPE confused the public making ignore the merits of that film and the willingness of Hitch to have the audience fooled by a lie told by a leading character in a flashback was disliked  far more disliked then it deserved to be  in STAGESTRUCK A matter of bad timing for UNDER CAPRICORN it was released just as the scandal of its star Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rosallini broke out made it seem to be a failure which it wasnt THE PARADINE CASE was another failure  and one that really had little in its favor With STRANGERS ON A TRAIN Hitchcock shied away from the special tricks that interested him in the recent films Instead he concentrated on his favorite themes of shared guilt and mistaken identity Based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith the story was of how Guy Haines a professional tennis player meets a fan of his  Bruno Anthony a playboy  who is traveling on a crosscountry train at the same time as the athlete Bruno is talkative and fawning and Guy views him as one of the typical fans he has metif a little eccentric with his talk of wanting to be on the first rocket to outer space But Bruno knows all about Guys personal problems He is married to a promiscuous young woman named Miriam and is in love with Anne Morton daughter of a Senator Bruno knows that Miriam wont divorce her successful celebrity husband Bruno mentions how he can sympathize  he hates his stepfather who is constantly criticizing him Then Bruno mentions sort of off the cuff an idea he has about two men  technically strangers  exchanging murders for each other and then committing two perfect unsolvable crimes instead of fumbling them Guy listens to the idea  and agrees it is an interesting idea The train reaches Guys destination and his last comment is like a validation of the idea He just does not realize that the eccentric Bruno is a sociopath and believes Guy has just agreed to the two killing each others foe Its a wonderfully simple plot actually Bruno of course does kill Miriam but he fully expects Guy to live up to the murder agreement and kill his stepfather Guy is horrified  and worse he finds that he is the police departments number one suspect When Bruno to encourage Guy mentions he has the latters lighter he pocketed it on the train and can plant it at the murder site Guy finds himself in deeper problems  how to avoid the police and how to control if possible the insane Bruno Hitch always planned the shots of his film carefully so that from the start we see both our heroes from their feet heading towards their fateful meeting in the train with each other There are constant crosscontacts used in the film to show how the two men are drawn into each others orbits It is like fate drawing them together Yet both have their own personality  and Hitch with a typical twist makes the mad Bruno actually more of an attractive figure His scheme may be vicious it will kill two people if successful and he will have Guy live up to the agreement no matter what but he has a zest for life One suspects that once Guy too had one but his marriages failure coupled with his now dating a socially prominent woman has made him more circumspect and dull than he was The cast is good too Robert Walker probably had his finest role in this film only a year before his death It was a far cry from the homespun boynextdoor of SINCE YOU WENT AWAY or THE CLOCK His lithe figure also looked quite elegant in tales in several scenes As Guy Farley Granger acts like a cousin of his comurderer in ROPE especially as the circumstances make him increasingly suspicious to the authorities as his earlier role made his jittery behavior increasingly suspicion to Jimmy Stewart As for the ladies Kasie Rogers is properly sluttish as Miriam  enabling the audience to be prepared for her demise in a famous sequence shot in the reflection of her eyeglasses so that they actually are cheering Bruno in his act of evil Patricia Hitchcock appears as the younger sister of Anne Ruth Roman who bears a close resemblance to Miriam and accidentally sets off Bruno at a social occasion She plays this rare role well Ruth Roman is properly supportive of Granger but her role is limiting because she is establishment in her background and somewhat low keyed Other supporting performers Leo G Caroll as the Senator Marion Lorne usually a comedian as Brunos dotty mother and Norma Varden as an unexpected recipient of violence from Walker are all shown to best advantage  all at the hand of a master
1,Roy Anderssons Du Levande is not totally original as it is counter piece to Anderssons previous movie Sånger från andra våningen Still the movie has aura of total originality Some conventions of movie making are still thrown away most of the actors look nothing like what you would expect in movie and the shots take long time Most of the time camera doesnt move but people move around it The shots start from somewhere and many times the scenery builds up in amazing proportions WG Sebald comes to mind in literature with same technique Because of the time invested in every shot the suspension is really high in many of the scenes There is a story and isnt  it is left for viewer to build up in his or her own mind This movie is positive It is determined not to see this all in negative way and at the same time will not pass the social injustices One of the messages I got from it was that maybe all failures and accidents are not fatal after all Great movie
1,Sigrid Thornton SeaChange was seemingly born to fill the role of Catos Philadelphia Gordon in this story that is often compared with Margaret Mitchells American Civil War classic Gone With the Wind Waters Heaven Tonight is in arguably his best role also as her larrakin love interest and the two leads head a wonderful Australian cast in this arguably the most wellknown and bestloved of Australian miniseries Its  an outstanding production all round though dont try watching all of it in one hit and it deserves to be remembered as a magnificent portrayal of life in preFederation Australia Rating 810
1,I saw this last night on Turner Classic Movies TCM I had never heard of it before and was quite surprised to find it so engrossing Bogart does a star turn as a citywise cynical editor who reluctantly goes along with his greedy radionetwork boss in this incisive B programmer About 12 years before he played similar citywise cynics to perfection in movies like Deadline USA Knock On Any Door The Barefoot Contessa and The Harder They Fall Bogie already had the star qualities down pat In order to boost ratings and bring their somewhat highbrow programming to a more popular level WUBC the Voice of America pushes a tellall radio miniseries about a woman who was acquitted 20 years ago by a plea of selfdefense of killing her husband Not willing to be discreet in order to save the womans and her husbands reputations the station uses underhanded methods to reveal all to all listeners and as luridly as possible As a time capsule I also found it very illuminating of malefemale mores in the workplace in the mid1930s Although beyond Henry ONeill Im unfamiliar with the supporting cast the players were uniformly excellent and the direction was taut If you like this kind of movie at all eg A Face In The Crowd An Inspector Calls etc dont miss the opportunity to see this one 
1,This lasted several years despite the late hour it was on Like a lot of 80s crime dramas it looked cold Both physically and figuratively This isnt a bad thing though And the obviously low budget actually worked in its favor Gritty during a time when slick was in Allan Royals wraparound segments as the news writer gave it a slight edge The only actors I remembered were Scott Nylands Earthquake and Tony Rosato SCTV The cast of barely knowns was a good thing because one could see the group as a whole and not as a bunch of people supporting a star And yes thats a young Clark Johnson Homicide in a recurring spot I hope a DVD release is in the future Someone out there wanna get on that
1,I have not seen it since 1998 and yet I STILL cant get it out of my head or stop recommending people to find it so that shows what an impression it made Just a wonderful story I just hope to see the stair at least once in person I didnt know much about Mr Petersen before this movie as I hadnt seen any of his previous works but his subtle acting in this impressed me and I think his portrayal of Grissom on CSI just shows more of the same He knows enough to let the character shine through instead of the actor shining through which makes him just that much better of an actor I cant remember enough about the poor accents to comment but I must say I have always enjoyed Barbara Hershey in all of her roles as well and I thought she also did a phenomenal job in this movie
1,I would say that this film is disturbing The brutality is depicted in a very sick way its like a psychosis in 40 minutes In the same time it is a cruel introspection in human behavior The scenes are ferocious starting with the butchery of the horse and ending with the brutal sex scene in the kitchen Every emotion is exploited to extreme the frustration of the butcher the love for his daughter almost incestuous the rage when he finds out she has been abused every feeling is so natural and so wrong This film delivers the truth about human nature in a very honest and brutal way The message of the film is that ones life can change in a second as a consequence of ones behavior and that the most primitive emotions are the most powerful and can determine ones acting Id loved the unique manner of filming the simplicity and the brutality accompanied with the silence in which only inner thoughts pierce through
1,Three tenyearold children born at the same time during a solar eclipse begin to slyly murder anybody that offends them While killer kid movies werent exactly new at the time of this twisted 80s slasher the theme of children as murderers works nicely for this film Bloody Birthday does deliver some good chills and suspense while managing to be a competent killer thriller with some strange qualities It straddles a fine line between cheesy and creepy but it does remain entertaining throughout with an interesting plot Theres some strong murder scenes as well as a good bit of nudity to establish this as a solid slasher guilty pleasure The cast does a fairly good job Young stars Elizabeth Hoy and KC Martel deliver some menacing performances while rising star Julie Brown does a striptease before a memorable murder scene Veteran star Susan Strasberg does well as the teacher and Jose Ferrer has a cameo appearance All around this offbeat slasher entry isnt bad though its admittedly not flawless but it is well worth watching for genre fans  out of 
1,I got this movie out a week after the death of Ichikawa Kon  I suppose if there is one way to mark the passing of a great director its to raise a glass of wine to him while watching one of his greatest movies Ichikawa had one of the finest careers in Japanese film but as he never had a distinctive style or theme he often seems to be overlooked compared to his near contemporaries such as Ozu and Kurosawa he was a little younger than them but not by much He is one of those directors who defies auteur theories  its likely that his wife who wrote the screenplay for this and many other of his movies was as much responsible for the quality of the movies as he was But at his best he was as good as any Japanese film maker at the time In particular he had great technical skills allowing him to tell complex stories in an accessible manner But in terms of theme this movie could hardly be simpler  war is hell No really its seriously hell Fire on the Plain doesnt follow the normal war genre rules There is no real beginning  we start as the wretched Tamura who is a regular private although it is implied he is more thoughtful and educated than most of the others  at one stage it is shown he understands English but he clams up when the others ask him how he knows it is ordered to hospital as his unit is already in an appalling state The soldiers are defeated and starving to death They are no longer an army just a rag bag group of refugees  hunted by the locals and pretty much ignored by the Americans who have bigger fish to fry Hunger and despair is driving the soldiers to the edge and beyond of madness In typical Ichikawa style its not all just grim  its oddly funny in parts a very black humour of course The high points of this movie to me are the outstanding performances from the leads and the vivid photography The characters in all their humanity but also their complete loss of humanity are all too believable This is that rare film  one which will refuse to erase itself from your head even if you want to forget it
1,Bottom has been my favourite sitcom ever since i saw it on tv and the movie is even better if your a bottom fan i say this is a must buy the plot is that Eddie and Ritchie run a hotel named guest house Paradise but not all goes right for them as customers leave until a famous actress come to stay they try there best to impress her but not all well go right this is a upbringing to British cinema so buy this and you will wet yourself with laughter also starring Simon Peggi shaun of the dead and also bill neigh love actually it might of not done good in the box office or by the looks of it on this website but dont listen to them buy this and i swear you will love it
1,I really enjoyed this movie and I usually dont like animated pictures But I thought the cats were appealing and the story line was charming There is a good song called Everybody wants to be a cat that is a lot of fun It has some comic moments and is an interesting adventure I think it helps to be an avid cat lover to enjoy this film
1,As a local performer I thought that Grease showcased what Broadway producers are looking for and it highlighted a small bit of the acting population Although my favorites did not win but came in second I enjoyed comparing myself to them and seeing what I liked and where I could improve as a performer They brought in Olivia NewtonJohn because she is the obvious link between the Broadway production and television audiences They sang songs from the movie Hopelessly Devoted et al because these songs will be included in the new production I agree with the earlier comment made that the BWay cast looks so much older but you must bear in mind that these are people who have been on Broadway and worked their tails off to be there If the entire cast was green and fresh then I believe that would have compromised the casting process by which producers choose their talent
1,Werner Herzog again explores the psyche of a man In Little Dieter we meet an effervescent brilliant man who survived the war in Bavaria seeing starvation and strange sights moved to the US and fulfilled his dream of being a flier War food death survival hoarding planes heads coming off how one American is born Herzog again sees madness as plane of existence and the surreal blends with the poignant as Herzog himself narratives this psychic travelogue of a German becoming an American who flies prop planes in a late 20th century war where the culmination of technology pilgrimage and eating out of garbage cans with spoons is melded with constant optimism into a man redefined into American As always with Herzog we are faced with florid madness brilliance and what is man in the face of his own excesses societal and personal We laugh and cringe and are amazed at this man Where else for this man but America
1,I will start by saying I have always been a Bonnie Hunt fan She always adds life to any character she plays and she did a wonderful job in her directorial debut I have to admit this is a chick flick But keeping that in mind it is a wonderful story it touches on many emotions and elicits all sorts of reactions This film depicts real life like people with real life like situations Tho I have to exclude the coincidence that is the major part of the film Its a love story not just of a man and a woman but the love of family friends and loved ones past Even pets I really enjoyed it Well worth the rental or the purchase
1,Sorte Nula is the 1 Box Office Portuguese movie of 2004 This extreme low budget production estimated USD150000 opened during Christmas opposite American Blockbusters like National Treasure Polar Express The Incredibles and Alexander but rapidly caught the adulation of the Portuguese moviegoers Despite the harsh competition the small film did surprisingly well topping all other Portuguese films of the past two years in its first weeks The film is a mysterymurder with a humorous tone cleverly written and directed by Fernando Fragata who has become a solid reference in the European independent film arena Did I like the film Oh yes
1,Acceptedlets see The only reason why i had chosen to see that movie was the hot dog shown in commercials when Shradersp said ASK ME ABOUT MY WEINER After that i HAD to see that movie and i watched it with a couple of my friendsand WOW amazing One of the best films of the year THe entire movie i was laughing like crazy The plot in this story is that Bartleby Justin Long doesnt get accepted into any of the schools he applied so he makes another fake college for him and his friends so that he can fool his parents that he DID make it into college So he makes the finishing touches and he fools his parentsuntil more students look at the website and see the clicker ACCEPTANCE IS ONE CLICK AWAY and all these rejects come to this school They face many problems and they just cant seem to get anything right 1010 LOVED IT NOW WATCH IT
1,this film explores if not creates a whole new genre with perfect imperfection  hilarity truth fun talent and circumstance that make for MAGIC  from creative musical numbers to off the cuff comedy that incorporates actors at their very best if i hadnt have known better i would have thought there was an elaborate script here what you get a mighty wind meets conversations with god meets something so fresh and new and delightful that it becomes its own entity peters and fell both give stellar performances and reel you in immediately the rest of the cast is also phenomenal there are no small parts only small actors and everyone involved here should be patted on the back taken out to dinner and be considered for an Oscar well done
1,The Childs Play series isnt a favourite of mine but Bride Of Chucky is actually an okay movie This time we have two dolls Chucky and his former girlfriend when he was human Tiffany Together they go on a journey to find an object There are a few interesting scenes through the movie like the guy getting hit by the truck and literally exploding the sex scene between Chucky and Tiffany and the ending which allows for another sequel to take place Wasnt really a straight forward horror it mixed a lot of comedy and was a sort of spoof of the horror genre This made the movie better like comedy does do with many horror movies All up even if your not a Childs Play fan give this one a go
1,Contains Spoilers Luchino Viscontis film adaptation of Thomas Manns novella is visually if not philosophically faithful to its source Brittens opera offers a more faithful reading of the ApollonianDionysian struggles which consume the aging writer It is certainly one of the most gorgeous films ever made  In the Visconti version the emphasis is more on the physical aspects of the story Never has Venice looked more beautiful and alluring more decadent and effete If youve read the novella its like having the descriptions on its pages come to life Dirk Bogarde gives an outstanding performance as Gustav von Aschenbach Although he has very little dialogue he conveys the bitterness aroused passion and finally pitiful yearning of Aschenbach through facial expressions alone Bjorn Andresen the young actor who plays Tadzio the beautiful object of Aschenbachs desire was perfectly cast He too plays the part with facial expressions and gestures The Tadzio character is pivotal to the story so any actor in this role must be worthy of inspiring passion and desire Visconti with his incredible eye for beauty knew exactly what he was doing And changing Ashenbach from a writer to a composer based on Gustav Mahler and then using Mahlers music especially the Adagietto from the 5th Symphony was another brilliant stroke Although Id read the Mann story before the film Mahlers music and Death in Venice will always be inextricably linked in my mind As will the haunting images which appear throughout the film especially that last one of Ashenbach dying on the beach as Tadzio walks slowly into the sea  One day this film will be released in DVD widescreen format and its visual splendors completely restored to us
1,The movie is based on a Jules Verne book I actually have read once about ten years ago I remember I liked the book a lot and this movie does a good job in telling the story The most important thing in this movie isnt the story however but the highly original visual look it has The visuals are absolutely beautiful and they are apparently achieved by a clever combination of animated drawings combined with live actors stopmotion animation and sets that are painted so that they look much like from an animated movie Combined by Jules Vernes own unique versions of airplanes and submarines and Karel Zemans good directing results in a very well done and convincing visual style that manages to effectively hold ones attention until the end of the movie There are some problems as well one of the underwater scenes at the end takes maybe needlessly lot of time for example as the story in the first part of the movie is rushed through quite quickly None of this matters much though since the movie is always highly enjoyable A gem that deserves to be more well known for todays audiences as well A recommended movie for the whole family
1,The Ali G show was really something amazing  he was so stupid wannabe rapper but no one he interviewed noticed that he was just pretending Sasha Cohen is actually very intelligent guy who pretends to be stupid so he could get really honest answers from people And it is very funny So I didnt expect movie to be good cause it was all acted  no real people or interviews So the basic point of all show was lost But I was wrong  I laughed all the time it was one of the funniest films I ever saw Sure it was stupid but who cares if you cant actually brake in to safe with a car battery like someone said It wasnt supposed to be a realistic documentary And it isnt like the show it goes in totally different way but that doesnt mean it is bad When I finished watching I was totally impressed but now when some time passed I realized that it was not that special anyway But it still deserves a nine  well at least for what it is supposed to be
1,The stark cold landscape of Big Sky Country with its majestic snowcapped mountains juxtaposed to barren plains is put to poetic use here in this Lynchian fableslide picture show about death and melancholy from the young and talented Polish Brothers who previously treated indie movie fans to the bizarre and fascinating Twin Falls Idahoa film about a young woman falling in love with two brothers who happen to be Siamese twins A little orphan boy is dying and a town is about to flooded in the name of progress in the form a damn and hydroelectric power plant With its eerily pleasing music score minimalist dialogue and character development and uncanny fantasy sequences involving some very unique angels the Polish brothers put their focus on what every good film artist knows a film should be about the moving picturesthe images the scenespaintings of deep beauty captured on celluloid This is best to be viewed late at night so that the haunting imagery can linger in your mind and wash over you as you drift off into sleep The fact that all of this was done on a shoestring budget of less than two million dollars puts Hollywood with their bloated film costs and hollow movies to shame and indicates something grand to come from the Polish brothers in the future
1,I liked this show from the first episode I saw which was the Rhapsody in Blue episode for those that dont know what that is the Zan going insane and becoming pau lvl 10 ep Best visuals and special effects Ive seen on a television series nothing like it anywhere
1,A blackly comic tale of a downtrodden priest Nazarin showcases the economy that Luis Bunuel was able to achieve in being able to tell a deeply humanist fable with a minimum of fuss As an output from his Mexican era of film making it was an invaluable talent to possess with little money and extremely tight schedules Nazarin however surpasses many of Bunuels previous Mexican films in terms of the acting Francisco Rabal is excellent narrative and theme The theme interestingly is something that was explored again in Viridiana made three years later in Spain It concerns the individuals struggle for humanity and altruism amongst a society that rejects any notion of virtue Father Nazarin however is portrayed more sympathetically than Sister Viridiana Whereas the latter seems to choose charity because she wishes to atone for her perceived sins Nazarins whole existence and reason for being seems to be to help others whether they or we like it or not The films last scenes in which he casts doubt on his behaviour and in a split second has to choose between the life he has been leading or the conventional life that is expected of a priest are so emotional because they concern his moral integrity and we are never quite sure whether it remains intact or not This is a remarkable film and I would urge anyone interested in classic cinema to seek it out It is one of Bunuels most moving films and encapsulates many of his obsessions frustrated desire mad love religious hypocrisy etc In my view Nazarin is second only to The Exterminating Angel in terms of his Mexican movies and is certainly near the top of the list of Bunuels total filmic output
1,I taped The Morrison Murders on Lifetime Movie network and I watched The Morrison Murders on Lifetime Lifetime Movie network and on Courttv Jonathan Scarfe and John Corbett did a great job of playing Luke and Walker Morrison I am glad that Walker got his brother Luke to confess of murdering his parents and their brother Bobby I enjoy watching True stories on Lifetime Lifetime Movie network and on Courttv The Morrison Murders is a good movie to watch Next time The Morrison Murders is on Lifetime Lifetime Movienetwork or Courttv I am going to watch The Morrrison Murders again because My favorite actor John Corbbett is in The Morrison Murders I give The Morrison Murders a ten because it is a good movie about Walker who tries to find out who killed his parents and his brother Bobby and at the end Walker discovers it was his brother Luke who murdered his parents and his brother Bobby
1,I first saw this on Demand Or on TV Im not really sure But this has got to be my all time favorite movie ever I mean this movie has blood gore laughs and chills through out the movie I recently ordered Monster Man from Amazon and ive been watching Monster Man ever since i got it Trust me you will love this movie  PS The commentary on the DVD is way funny They also said something about Monster Man 2 during the commentary Lets hope they make Monster Man 2 If you have the chance rent the movie or buy it You will absolutely LOVE it This is the best movie that has come out in 2003 1010
1,The historical inaccuracies of this film have been well documented It was never intended to be serious history but an entertaining saga and there it succeeds Errol Flynn was never better as this role was tailored for him Olivia DeHavilland was never more beautiful Arthur Kennedy never more villainous Anthony Quinn never more noble than as Crazy Horse It had much humor and pathos and held your interest throughout The one historical aspect I found most glaringly inaccurate was the final Last Stand which occurred on the banks of the Little Big Horn The film version was filmed in a desert with no river in sight However I still consider it marvelous entertainment typical of Hollywoods golden age
1,You can take the crook out of the joint but it seems exceedingly more difficult to take the joint out of the crook Weve seen this kind of character in this kind of situation before and since in movies like BOB LE FLAMBEUR ELEVATOR TO THE GALLOWS TOUCHEZ PAS AU GRISBI THE ANDERSON TAPES etc Too many times to mention What helps make this one one of the more notable is of course the heist itself which plays out wordlessly in real time and the demeanor of the lead Bogart would think twice before crossing this guy The ironic ending is perfectly suited to this story it almost demands it All around one of the better films noir
1,This is unfortunately Carlins last recorded HBO concert from a series that lasted over 30 years Though this may not be his best work it is excellent funny and thought provoking This recording is also a bit different from most of his other concerts that it is a bit lengthier than most of his other concerts Throughout his long prolific and influential career Carlin has moved from the more observational humor and fart jokes towards a more humanitarian viewpoint of society and culture His focus on the English Language and euphemisms increased throughout the years and culminates in this performance Though I would argue that his audio book When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops best displays his vast wit with regards to language euphemisms and the breakdown of our values Its Bad For Ya is quite indicative of his long transformation from a comedian to a writer If you are offended by foul language or the disparagement of the church you will probably not like any of Carlins stand up material However if you enjoy being mentally stimulated and can tolerate the language and blasphemy you would probably greatly enjoy this concert
1,This one gets better with each new look Certainly one of Paul Sorvinos best roles Outstanding music score which was also outstanding on sound track LP so why no CD One the very early dolby stereo sound film releases By the way the original 35mm theatrical trailer for this is really GREAT
1,This is a gripping story that borrows elements from the Kennedy assassination and uses them successfully to create an excellent western tale The movie has a good music score though it relies on repeating the title theme a little too much Giuliano Gemma and the rest of the cast are superb This is a more cerebral than usual spaghetti western that relies more on story than action and it succeeds because the story is excellent This is not to say that there is no action in the movie There is plenty and it is very well crafted This movie pulls you in right away and keeps you absorbed til the end Youll always be wondering whats in those documents everyones after It also has some biting commentary on American politics This movie shows why Valerii in my opinion is in a three way tie with Sollima and Corbucci for second place in the rankings of spaghetti western directors
1,I enjoyed Ramin Bahranis Man Push Cart and this film is equally good This slice of life is almost a documentary about how life on the edges is lived Alejandro Polanco and Isamar Gonzales do an excellent job as a 12yearold brother and a 16yearold sister who live in a small room over an auto shop There are no parents they are on their own surviving Ali supplements his income by stealing auto parts selling bootleg DVDs and selling candy on the subway Izzie supplements her income working a food truck by selling herself They are trying to make money to but their own truck One is tempted to express outrage at the fact that these two children are left to fend on their own and certainly one can be very upset that Izzie sells her body to willing truckers but the fact is that this exists today in the worlds richest country not some underdeveloped land Save the outrage and do something
1,Nazarin by the acclaimed surrealist Bunuel is ovbviously an attack on the Catholic Church and its loss of values It is not a visual film and I think it would have played better on the stage Bunuel takes us through this man the nazarene that lives like Christ lived a true follower ie in poverty and without a care for property and what the next day bringeth Some might call it a parallel to Christs story but any follower and practitioner of the word life should be like Christ in a way But in essence Bunuel also inquires into the ogle of mans selfishness and need to sin and how goodness may save us all It is a bold statement to make that may enliven or recite to memory the movie for some Truth be told the Nazarene is also selfish because he gives without wanting in return or asking for it His selfishness is his folly and the two women who follow him represent the sides of a coinwith the same face on each side Lots of people represent sides of a coin in this movie all with both faces the same But the movie isnt exactly memorable once it ends and one could attack many of its ethical perforations and effusions within the movies own doctrine Not topnotch Bunuel but a surreal dream sequence that bunuel stages whithin where the message of the movie is framed and is worth noting for it shows you the capability of the director Bunuel
1,In 1937 Darryl Zanuck who had recently moved from head of production at Warner Brothers was trying to get his newly created company 20th Century Fox off the ground and on a level playing field with his old bosses at Warners and the glitter palace at MGM This Is My Affair was an attempt to cash in on the current success of historical films set around the turn of the century San Francisco In Old Chicagoand in retrospect he succeeded quite mightily The plot is fascinating A trouble maker but heroic naval officer Robert Taylor is given a secret assignment by President McKinley to uncover a ring of bank robbers that are paralyzing American finance He finds the gang but falls in love with their female mascot Barbara Stanwyck and must decide between love and duty Not everything about this vintage film works well but overall it is a good slice of studio filmmaking The plot gimmick would be borrowed by Kurt Vonnegut for Mother Night the lead role of that film of the book was played brilliantly by Nick Nolte and seems quite believable at least within the confides of studio make believe As a fan of old movies I am always thrilled when I stumble upon one that I have never seen and This is my Affair was no exception
1,The Director of Kannathil Muthamittal directed the first Indian film I had seen Dil Se which led me down the path of buying well over 122 Hindi DVDs in the course of four months I can say I understood the total attraction I was somehow confused as to why the film would stop for music videos It was an excellent movie I didnt know what to make of the dancing and the female vocals were a bit shrill for my western ears but somehow I found AR Rahmens score hypnotic I bought the soundtrack the following day and then Lagan Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and K3G the following week and with the exception of Ichi the killer a few other Korean films  I cant be bothered to watch much else Kind of strange for someone who has only watched a strict diet of Hong Kong Horror and ActionScience fiction films for the past 30 years But I should get back to Kannathil Muthamittal It is one of the Mani Ratmans latest efforts and I laughed Cried Got totally mad terrified and most of all I didnt feel manipulated The acting was superb the photography was beautiful I think you could stop the movie at any given time and would notice that any give frame would be worthy of painting The music fit the movie perfectly and after the credits rolled I wanted to watch again so I did It would be foolish to discuss the plot for fear that you may miss the pleasure of watching the events unfold and the characters develop This is what great film is all about I stood and applauded in my home theater when it was over My wife is watching now and I cant wait for her reaction I cant expect it will be anything less than mine
1,This outing of Knotts includes one of his best sidekicks ever Frank Welker Welker makes the film Knotts and Welker compete for the laughs and both receive plenty Knotts works for a small no where town where the city is being run by some of the most ignorant officials When things go wrong the city fathers allow Knotts to take the fall Frank Welkers character befriends Knotts and together they stumble together to clear up the mess and Knotts good name This film shows the usual Knotts scared to death character that made him famous for years on television and film This may have been Knotts last good outing When you have an extra 90 minutes get a good old fashioned laugh a great icon Don Knotts
1,The short film which got Gaspar Noe on the movie map introducing us to his horrific but thoroughly interesting character The Butcher played brilliantly by Phillipe Nahon Noes direction here has all the hallmarks of his later films showing he was carving his own voice and style from the beginning His sudden cutting along with harsh loud noise skipping flashbacks and many other techniques all are used to disconcert the viewer And it certainly works Also he is not afraid of showing violence as viewers of Irreversible will know Here the violence is equally powerful and in the sequel Seul Contre Tous it is almost unbearable The film opens with a horse being killed It is shot in the head and we watch it writhe on the floor its pool of blood flowing out We then see a human birth in all its bloody glory the daughter of The Butcher He was orphaned in WWII and has grown up hating the world and everyone and everything in it He serves his customers but his interior monologue constantly reminds us of his thoughts he wants them all dead His daughter Blandine Lenoir who would also reprise her role six years later is the only thing he cares about and we watch them grow older together She is however mute and the subject of bullying and toying The Butchers relationship with her is almost incestuous bathing her when she is old enough to do it herself etcbut this is explored more in the next film When she is attacked by a man the Butcher explodes with rage stabbing an innocent man in the mouth He goes to prison taken from the only things he wants his shop and daughter In the short 40 minutes we see all this and more his time in prison and release back to his world Because of his daughters state autistic as well i think she is bland does little except stare and is under the full control of her father The film continues in the exceptionally bleak Seul Contre Tous If you can watch these two films this one first It has some truly excellent acting but is very difficult to watch because of the relentless tone 7 out of 10
1,Wow Why arent more British movies like this Great rights of passage money with a big heart and some stand out performances The comedy is quirky and original and the kid is really great One to hunt down and watch Look out for it Ten out of ten
1,Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films In The Company of Men  Your Friends and Neighbors with this funny and original thrillercomedyroad movie When Betty Renee Zellwegger witnesses the brutal murder of her nogood husband Aaron Eckhart she develops a bizarre sort of amnesia and flees in his car not knowing that there is large stash of drugs in the trunk Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are the hit men who follow her What Betty is chasing besides a new beginning although she cant remember the old life is her beloved Dr David Ravell Greg Kinnear Only problem Dr David isnt real hes a soap opera character on the show A Reason To Love and hes really an egotistical actor named George McCord To say any more regarding what develops would be too much but Nurse Betty is certainly original Its hit men are like the hired killers of Pulp Fiction are violent yet philosophical its take on soap operas terrific spoof material and its acting is the best feature of all This has to be one of the best cast films in recent years Renee Zellwegger is perfect for Nurse Betty with the constant gleam in her eye that pushes her in her quest Morgan Freeman brings his constant state of grace to the role of a killer at the end of his career and Chris Rock is his partner a man of rage and great impatience Greg Kinnear is at his comic best as the vain actorsoap opera doctor There are also great supporting performances from actors such as Emmywinner Allison Janney The West Wing Harriet Sansom Harris Frasiers agent Bebe Glazer and Kathleen Wilhoite Chloe on ER Actually the supporting cast is a Whos Who of television best character actors A unique film that is funny one moment and chilling the next Nurse Betty is a mix of great acting casting and a terrific screenplay
1,Logged on to the imdb to say what a charming film Love Love is and am totally confused Seems to me that someone has been getting their titles mixed up Plastic demon baby what This wasnt Love Life A little bit luvy dovey for my tastes but a great funny and original film Especially liked the ending that didnt fall into the normal pit of cliche that all hollywood romantic films crash and burn it Nine out of ten
1,Very nice movie I was browsing the channels on my TV and I usually ignore the channels that air drama movies but then I saw this channel that airs old school movies and it is where I saw this movie At first when I saw the title The Cure I thought its gonna be boring but then I got hooked when I saw Brad Renfro was in this movie because of one of my favorite movie of all time is The Client where Brad also stars Then the scenes was getting better and better The story is so beautiful and very touching I cried hard in this movie which I dont usually do Great casting and there are so many beautiful linesquotes in this movie which is very striking and made me cry hard Now I bought my own copy on DVD and I always recommend it to everyone
1,I enjoyed this film which I thought was well written and acted There was plenty of humour and a thoughtprovoking storyline A warm and enjoyable experience with an emotional endingGood fun
1,What a great show A very underrated dramatic show It is great how there are no main characters and every episode some other characters are the main charactersI think the best character on the show is Vern Schillinger He is a tough bad guy and an Aryan on top of that which makes him a true bad guy prisoner who there are many that are known to be This show has many murders I think it is a little over exaggerated for the killing on the show but I have to admit that is one of the reasons why I think the show is so greatI think some characters were killed off a little early but some sure still made their mark You cant compare things like Prison Break to this show they are totally different I think some of the actors on the show are also very good and underrated and should what is due to them A great show my favorites A show that should be considered of the the greats for years to come
1,WTF Do any of his booksmovies end in a happy ending The Notebook was goodbut sheesh enough with the depressing endings already Im told that he writes about realistic situations that people deal with in real life Understandablebut sometimes its nice to see people who have sacrificed their whole lives to only get to a mediocre unhappy time in their lives  to finally find the true meaning of happiness and are able to live it out for the rest of their days Dont we already know what really happens in real life Cant we  for one moment an hour and a half live vicariously through a movie that ends on a happy note  that gives us hope for our own futures  Yeah  wah I know But for real I think we need to preface movies that end like this one with a warning Beware No happy ending
1,Millions in gold is traveling by train to the US treasury Traveling along is Lois Lane to report on it Along the way the train is attacked by masked thieves They detach the car with the armed guards in it and attack the remaining ones This leads to a vicious fight between the remaining guards and the thieves The thieves overpower them but then Lois Lane jumps in She beats the thieves off the train at one point using a gun but the train starts to careen out of control Lois cant stop it and the thieves will stop at nothing to get the gold Good thing Superman is on the way Fast exciting nonstop action Probably one of the best of all the cartoons Just great
1,One of the best guy movies Ive ever seen has to be the Wind and the Lion Gad the scenes Raisoulis bandits swarm over the wall A staid British gentleman calmly gets up from tea with Candice Bergen and drops three of them with a Webley revolver in his coat A whisper from the ghost of Empire Lest we forget Lest we forget US Marines coming ashore from the long long gone Brooklyn They were carrying Krags it should have been Lees but oh wow And the Winchester 97 blowing large holes in obstreperous natives and even more obstreperous and faithless Europeans  Raisouli Sean Connery o Wowwondering What kind of gun does Roosevelt use Teddy RooseveltBrian Keith o Wowwondering What kind of gun does Raisouli use and writing yet another angry letter to Winchester about the stock on his Winchester 95 Raisouli armed with but a sword A Prussian cavalry officer HOLSTERING his pistol and drawing HIS sword Honor Thats something long dead from a world long gone but Raisouli would never have flown a plane full of children into a building Milious at Miliouss magnificent best and now out on DVD
1,I watched this film during a special advanced preview in Reading Berkshire The two main characters Michael and Rory strike up a friendship when Rory is introduced to the care home that Michael already resides Michael is amazed to find someone who can finally understand him as until now his cerebal palsey made people think that he couldnt communicate  Rory introduces Michael to the life that hes missing Rory is a feisty character who doesnt let his condition Muscular Dystrophy get to him They bond and apply for Independent living and find a lovely flat and assistant and have all the fun that they could ever dream of Dont go to see this film if you are after some Entertainment Do go see this film if youre willing to see something a little different The storyline is strong the actors are fantastic and despite the sadness that comes with the film the mood is uplifting I thoroughly recommend it Though if you are anything like me and prone to crying  take tissues as youll need them
1,I am awed by actress Bobbie Phillips and her superb skill as an action star This movie is propelled by her wonderful acting and terrific action prowess I am a fan of scifi but I must say that this film exceeds most science fiction films in its cinematography and mostly its utilization of an actress whose presence supersedes the plot which is fine but is nothing new Even though it looks as though this film was made for television in my opinion it is better than most theatrically released films of its kind
1,And what is its genre The backstage expose story what theatrical life is really like behind those Broadway and other curtains It certainly has a lot of competition Singin in the Rain both I and II 1929 and 1952 42nd Street Golddiggers of You name the year Dames of 1934 Noises Off 1992 from the farcical side and A Star is Born I and II from the 1930s and the 1950s from the tragical side not to mention Summer Stock of 1950 the list keeps rollin along So what makes this movie so special And why are there so few comments about this stunningly great movie Have so few people actually seen it How amazing to see a younger Frank Langella preDracula and preFrostNixon by 30 years How amazing to see the fresh and talented Tom Hulce so preAmadeus And yet another superb Stiller What a wonderful lineup of talented people at their very best from so long ago And such a script Who was this David Shaber So full of realistic disillusion and pathos compared to the usual sentimentality and feelgood comedy As especially exemplified by the StarIsBornlike episode where the heroine achieves Broadway while the Langella character has to content himself with still another provincial tour Langellas subsequent hysterical and sadistic blowup against the starstruck Latin teacher and his granddaughter in which he vents his fury and frustration is just one of many fantastic and psychologically real moments in the film The Latin teacher and his love affair with backstage life certainly echo Marlene Dietrich and her seduced professor in The Blue Angel of 1929 Another in the series of mercenary and coldhearted agents like Kevin McCarthy who was preceded by Burt Lancaster in The Sweet Smell of Success 1957 and succeeded by Alan Alda in Clubland 2001 in movie history The sexual liberation of the Hulce character recalls similar incidents in ONeills great comedy Ah Wilderness And what a tribute to the vanished operettas of long ago The Red Mill of Victor Herbert Rose Marie and The Vagabond King of Rudolf Friml The Desert Song of Sigmund Romberg etc What satirical insertions of bits from the great plays like Romeo and Juliet Tributes to the theater itself as expostulated by the star Langella The richness and depth of this movie are simply endless And to be saddled by such a title Who could have an inkling of what this great movie is about from such a ridiculous and unsuggestive title But on the other hand what title could one have applied to such a magnificent drama which might have lived up to its stirring emotional content PS I just saw 2009 Frank Langella in his latest acting spectacular as Richard Nixon in FrostNixon How this great actor after 30 years simply goes from triumph to triumph
1,I just want to say that Chris Diamantopouloss role as Williams for that entire show was Emmy worthy It was uncanny how well he did And to be as rapidfire and as random and as creative as Robin Williams really isWOW There were scenes where Diamantopoulos had to say probably 20 rapid fire lines and do 15 different characters while delivering those lines all while sounds as much like ROBIN WILLIAMS doing those characterswell that my friends is impressive acting Its one thing to do a Robin Williams impersonation for a couple of minutes Its another to do it for a whole TV movie I dont know how I felt about the whole show and I dont know how much they played with the facts but I do know that it was Chris Diamantopoulos that kept me watching So for that I give HIM a 10
1,Being a great fan of horror especially Asian horror I have seen tons of movies but this one is outstanding Why It does have a plot which is unfortunately quite rare among horror movies The actors did a good job It feels like a real documentary film even if its not It does not get boring for a moment The director cleverly combines the plot with the acts of a certain Japanese magic cult perhaps this cult never existed but still its believable It reminded me of the similarly great movie Forbidden Siren To me the one and only annoying thing about the movie was the character Hori the psychic but this is subjective I recommend this movie to all fans of quality horror 9 out of 10
1,it starts off with a view of earth and jupiter aligned where do we come from and where we are headed the story starts with the dawn of Man a documentarylike view of the Prehistoric grasseater ape that was facing its extinction due to no physical ability that would let him hunt to eat and the lack of grass and water in the austral Africa the monkeys hadnt survived if it wasnt for the godlike intervention of an alien artifact that somehow transformed the apes that touched it and gave them the ability to use tools that were first used as weapons that allowed them to kill pigs to eat for super and to kill other monkeys in fights for water that ape was Man an enigmatic start for an enigmatic film after the fastforward that leaves the movie at the present days we see a magnificent dance of spaceships at the sound of Strauss The rest of the movie is about how tools got control of Man the strange artifact appears once again to evolve Man to his final stage the starchild at 1968 the year this movie was released only astronauts had idea of what was out there in space after this movie that changed its futurism took 7 years to be explored the special effects are incredible they are completely realistic even today the directing along with excellent taste in music good acting and the fantastic filmography makes it an epic the plot with its vision of the year 2001 and the evolution of man tools with an AI psycokiller with the psycotropical hypnotising end makes it the trip our lives if you have never seen this movie see it dont be scared with the lack of dialog sit back and enjoy its a symphony of evolution its terrific
1,Some said that this was a nose candy glorification flick but short of the original Dr Hydes concoction no drug has yet been developed that can provide THIS effect If Viagra was the slime mold stage that white sparkling powder is the Stephen Hawking evolutionary rung or at least the pharmacist idiot savant branch This reality show is really about the sacred cows of medicine seen as was the emperor without clothes Few of us want to question the health field both because most of us would not have lived to our current age had we been born before modern medicine and because our subconscious hopes that we will continue to live on if we have faith in the helping professions So the geniuses who produced this movie made jokes out of those Calcutta Bessys giving us the sugar that allows us to swallow the modern institution of medicine The timing was right and many were able to see the business side of the healing companies behind the curtain of Oz A decade before when George C Scott ranted through the movie The Hospital my wife and I were sitting in the packed premiere in Oklahoma City Just as in Jekyll  Hydes remake we were almost unable to keep from falling out of our seat and laughed and howled uncontrollably for the duration The hundreds of other audience members were deadly silent They were shocked that doctors nurses  the hospital institution were being mocked It was as if the Pope Billy Graham and Gandhi were were sitting in the Animal House beer stained tee shirts and all competing to see who could tell the funniest God knockknock jokes between belches Had The Hospital been a slapstick comedy rather than a satire they might have been able to see what was being shown to them Unfortunately they were like Republicans at a screening of Michael Moores 911 Perhaps smaller golden parachutes would have been given to the corrupt medical corporation leaders health insurance companies would have had a tougher time denying medical care and health providers would have been demystified earlier if George C Scott had tap danced in a tutu while delivering his terrible truths Butforget everything I just said Watch the movie be consciously made as happy and joyful and full of laughter as the best ever Saturday Night Live skit and let the subconscious soak in the documentary of the underlying reality Just dont blame me when Got to Got to Got to Got to becomes one of your sayings or when Hydes Got Nothing to Hide occupies that portion of your brain now paralyzed by Its a Small World After All Or when you start calling your local hospital Our Lady of Pain and Suffering instead of Our Lady of Eternal Construction Even Oklahomans were changing their favorite terrible boss wishbone winner entreaty from Piss on him and leave him for dead to Body in a pit you in it The smell of deathits gone Chicken sushi Mary MARY MARYEEEEEEEEEEEEE
1, Average adventure movie that took a serious story and Holywoodised itThe watering down effect done particularly towards the average script snatched away this movies place as a would be solid classic Why water down such a great storylineProbably because it deals with sensitive colonial subject matters and the producers do not want to create political heatjust quick profits thank youThe directingcinematography and soundtrack and acting was goodThe screenplay was averageThe charm of Connery made up for his wrong Arabic accent and all the scenes with President T Roosevelt were masterpiece takesThe costumessets here was very goodToo bad we did not get more of a serious historical drama since this is what the story demandsOnly for big fans of the lead actors or fans of exotic RomanceAdventure Holywood movies
1,This movie is based mainly on the emotions and interactions of people There are only three locations the school the store and the coachs house that are really used Its primarily at the coachs house however A movie doesnt need special effects or amazing views to be amazing in itself Four friends who had bonded during their basketball days meet up One is rich important and has no real love outside of money One wants to be mayor again but his competition is turning him sour One wants to be superintendent of the school and take care of his family One is a traveling alcoholic First off I love the actors in this film Theyve all been household names to me They proved their worth here One of the most pivotal moments is when Tom played by Gary Sinise blows up on the coach He yells and rants about how the coach cheated in the winning game His blows the coachs whistle and yells back his catchphrases  Forgive me Father for I have sinned Its amazing to watch with energy that just chills you Highly recommended to anyone who understands human emotion and doesnt need shiny effects to interest them
1,Pixote is directed with barely a shred of sentimentality And yet I more than imagine Hector Babenco owes some of his filmmaking chops with this film to Vittorio De Sicas neorealist style in particular Shoeshine that film as with Pixote takes place mostly inside a childrens prison And yet while I might still prefer De Sicas film if it came down to deciding between the two its so close because it is no pun intended like choosing between two children Theyre both marvelous works of raw drama and with Pixote Babenco has an extra edge and harrowing quality to deal with in that this isnt filmed in conditions brought on after a world war This is how it was in Brazil one would see it with slightly more flair and awe in City of God perhaps in some of the same locations and these children were on the streets before and after the film was made Some arent alive some 20 years later for all anyone knows The star preteen street kid Fernando Ramos da Silva plays the title character a youth without a father or really any family who will look out for him and placed among dozens of other street kids and delinquents in a reformatory for boys The conditions couldnt be much worse and are made even more unbearable as two children are killed one after the other by some cause of the guard duty Theres a riot and an escape and halfway through the film we find Pixote with a few other youths including Lilica a practical transvestite not even 18 and they become pickpockets drug dealers whatever to get by None of this I should repeat is shown with a kind of hamfisted earnestness certainly you would never in a million years see Ron Howard or Paul Haggis direct this kind of picture and yet theres an emotional honesty to everything exactly because nothing is trivialized Nearly every scene is significant to showing how fragile life is for Pixote and how he could be killed or die some way at any turn and so without even reaching puberty yet he has to be on the level of those around him who are a little older though not by much at all and become things that will haunt this person forever Despite Babencos usage of a tender and mournful musical score and one or two scenes with people crying a lot nothing feels forced As with De Sica maybe moreso given the consistent conditions of San Paolo and Rio street kids hes a natural director of children and coaxs out of Ramos da Silva and Jorge Julião and others some really fine work that provides just the right touches of cinematic drama that is not so real that it becomes documentary which isnt a bad thing persay and even subtlety in some scenes Pixote may not be as well known as its later 21st century Brazilian films that look back on the horrors of Rio or even neorealist films but it should be Anyone wanting to get a good hard glimpse at what it was like should seek it out at a library or other and soak in what is the best foreign film of 1981
1,This film is the most romantic in years David Duchovny is superb He´ll make you cry smile and dream Minnie driver and James Belushi are very good too But David is astonish Don´t miss the opportunity to see this little film and fall in love with Bob and Grace Run don´t walk
1,This was the film that first indicated to me what a great actor Martin Sheen really is He modestly claims that Charlie is a better actor Charlie cant hold a candle to him I found it suspenseful and thoroughly enjoyed the intertwining of the love story with the main plot and I usually HATE love stories Theres a great plot twist at the end that struck me as being fully credible particularly in the early 80s time period and probably now also The final scene had me on the edge of my seat This film roundly illustrates that treachery is often doled out by those we trust while declared enemies have more in common than they suspect and finally that human compassion can be found where we least expect it irenerose
1,I regard this loving and sensitively written story to be one of the screens true masterpieces After having seen this film originally on the silver screen with my mother in Los Angeles California when it first came out many years passed before I would have the opportunity to experience it again The beauty quiet simplistic elegance and tranquility of the film to me set it aside from many many others of its kind Yes tears still come to my eyes when I see it and hear the refrain of that once in a lifetime song perhaps still today my number one alltime most beloved film I would hope this classic love story will be enjoyed and appreciated by our future generations
1,Thats certainly not the best film ever But thats certainly worth seeing for people with a special kind of mind So the one who loves sadness and depression and scary fairytales at night and wolves and real madness  welcome If you find a copy of course As for me I could stand it only once But since that the Wolves and SaintLucy and childrens drawings and a headless Christ live in my nightmares
1,Dont watch this movie expecting the Jane Austen wit crisp dialog or clever social commentary This time around the premise of Northanger Abbey has been updated in a very sensual way  In this versionCatherines erotic daydreams are not just silly fantasies but a connection to the world of adult sexuality she is just peeking into with her daylight adventures By day she is very prim and demure and her swain Henry treats her with the utmost courtesy But as her own sexual nature awakens her daydreams shift every so subtly from mild to steamy to lurid  At the beginning of the story Catherines visions of sex are based entirely on the Gothic novels she devours in bed It is both heartwarming sexy and provocative to observe the way her dreamy picture of handsome Henry dissolves into a lurid dream of being carried off and ravished by romantic villains At the same time it is wry and touching to cut back to her bed in the morning  Catherine sleeping peacefully looks so innocent one would never guess what really goes on in that pretty little head  Later after being invited to Henrys castle Catherine overhears a family argument and totally misunderstands its meaning Jumping into bed she covers herself up with the bedsheets and lies awake listening fearfully her striking blue eyes the only visible sign that she is alert Little by little however those pretty blue eyes droop and close as she drifts into another heated dream of innocent desire This time Catherine dreams she is in Elizabethan times waiting fearfully outside the castle for the approach of the banditi Its pretty clear she is more excited than terrified by the idea of being carried off by bandits She all but shudders with excitement and anticipation But then after a shot of her running frantically to escape we are back to the daylight world where the maid is scolding her for having made a mess of her room before falling into a sound sleep Its worth noting that Catherines heavyeyed yawning in the morning light is itself a rather sensual symbol of how passionate her dreams have been  Ultimately of course Catherines stern and unimaginative lover Henry divines the nature of her fantasies and gives her a stern lecture Its interesting that Catherines immediate collapse into tears symbolizes not a retreat but an advance into adult relationships In the next scene she tearfully burns her Gothic romance and throws herself shamefaced and sobbing onto the bed Significantly this turning point is also marked by Catherine falling into a deep sleep  except that this time there are no dreams of make believe passion Presumably Catherine has matured enough to be ready for the real thing Though Katherine Schlesinger has lovely blue eyes and a lively expression and all her performance is charming it must be said that outside of the heated dream sequences this movie adaptation is excruciatingly dull Im giving it 9 stars only because the truly romantic may enjoy it purely on a daydream level If youd like to read a book about a genuinely strong willed young heroine who overcomes real darkness and danger in a real Gothic setting I highly recommend THE PERILOUS GARD by Elizabeth Marie Pope
1,This is a movie that has all the basic elements of its genre It makes you wanna cry it makes you laugh it disgust you it makes you angry etc  The topic of the story is fortunately not about some disease or drugs what is the common trend in gay themed movies in these days but it focuses on the social interactions between characters what could be considered not to be in the high school elite The play and the direction could be a little bit more sophisticated but on the other hand its somehow better so because it really shows the distress of the characters that they are experiencing If this was intended then this is a remarkable job and assuredly an achievement specially for such an young director  Its actually a good story that gives you a little inside into how it is to be a fat girl and to acknowledge it to yourself
1,This movie was simply amazingThe writing was incredible as well as the directing and actingThe story instantly gets you interestedThis movie is one of those movies that has your heart pounding the whole timeAs always Damian Chapa is brillianthis on screen acting is as powerful as any Hollywood actorThe cast in this film is perfectEach character made the story more completeThe cinematography was captivating and it uplifted the movieI was totally stuck to the screen and couldnt stop watching itthere was no getting up for popcorn or anythingThis movie is one of the best all yearmaybe even the bestDefinitely rent this movieI recommend it this movie if u want to see great filmaking or just for pure entertainment
1,Its the old old story  kids have a party in an old house demons are unleashed death and gratuitous nudity ensues You all know it its still a lot of fun Many people okay many horror fans to be specific have fond memories of this movie and its always with slight trepidation that you revisit an old movie to see if its still as good as you used to think it was Luckily this is It has something for everyone well everyone who happens to be male I suppose From a fun title sequence to a shoplifting scam involving cunning use of Linnea Quigleys ass to the mirror scene to the full on demonic fun this is a blast from start to finish The girls are cute the guys are     male the death scenes are well done with some good gore effects and unlike some horrors from the era this actually keeps a good sense of atmosphere and even tension throughout Dont get me wrong its still fun first and foremost but it offers some nice freaky moments that should please most genre fans
1,The Duke is a very silly filma dog becoming a duke But its a very fun movie It has some of those corny pranks that many kids movies have but thankfully no bodily function jokes as so many animal movies feel compelled to have Mostly its just dogs being dogs and people being   well people The good guys are likeable and appealing The bad guys are ridiculous and of course the pun of many jokes But there is something dignified about this movie for even though it is silly its not out for every cheap laugh like Home Alone and others Crocket Simon and Copper do an excellent job playing Black and Tan Coonhound Hubert who becomes the Duke after his beloved owner a real Duke dies For the most part they just act like dogs no talking or humanlike emotions and attitudes However they do stereotype poodles and Hubert does fall for her just because shes a poodle Come on These are dogsthey have a different view of beauty Overall charming fun and enjoyable
1,Motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat bgrade desertbased films such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man which more or less takes place in the desert It also models some of the bizarre humor and especially eccentric trail of characters of writer Joseph Minions comedy After Hours In a sort of desert roadtrip fantasy a metaphor of temptation and redemption Gus played well by Jordan Christopher Michael a clever 10 yearold boy cashes in his piggy bank steals a Mustang and runs away from his grossly neglecting parents It begins as a trip through salvation which is apparent in the scenes with John Diehl but once he becomes hooked on a scratchoff game called Motorama he becomes easily tainted by temptation and looses his childish innocence He travels from one crazy fictional state to another concocting ways of getting Motorama cards from participating gas stations just enough so that he might spell out the prize winning word MOTORAMA and be eligible for the 500 million cash prize Along the way he is embattled with dozens of strange characters such as Flea who plays a high strung busboy Meatloaf who plays a crazy biker and Mary Woronov and Sandy Baron a Seinfeld regular as two violent kidnappers  The DVD rerelease can be very deceptive as have previous attempts to sell this film to the noncult market first with taglines comparing it to Home Alone and Thelma  Louise The newest calling it a love story with the tagline implying that the film is about Jordan Michael Christopher on an adventure to meet the girl of his dreamswhich despite the size of her picture on the DVD cover is actually only about a 1 second cameo by Drew Barrymore as the fantasy girl that Gus dreams about Why didnt they just market it for what it was Thought it may seem totally bizarre on first viewing it is actually a welldesigned narrative  Motorama is great material for fans of strange bgrade comedies This was quite an interesting story and particularly because of the strength of its lead actorJordan Michael Christopher who unfortunately has few other screen credits of noteand the clever metaphor inherent in the plot Hopefully its rerelease on DVD will make it an easier find for cult fans
1,Imagine you have the opportunity to see yourself again as a kid Now think what would happen if you had the chance to speak with your younger self or even change himyou Would you try to influence or try to change your younger selfs beliefs in light of your future experience Or perhaps the encounter would change your older selfs perception of life and reality  Walt Disneys The Kid tries to engage this complex thought by putting older self Bruce Willis in a collision course with younger self Spenser Breslin from The Santa Clause 2 and The Cat in the Hat fame The result is a sometimes funny sometimes touching encounter which makes you ponder about your own past present and future  and truly believe it is never too late to change your course
1,Excellent drama about 2 alienated spoiled punks who go afoul of the federal government each for his own reasons One a druggie just wants to score some bucks for his next fix but the other has a far more sinister agenda fueled in part by a resentment of his father Good performances and a hot script makes this a winner
1,I dont think I will include any spoilers but If I do I can cover my butt The Last American Virgin came in a time were such teenage coming of agehigh school sex romps were the rave Films such as Prepies 1984 Hot Times 1974 and the popular Porkys  1981 were making mucho money Yet it is the Last American Virgin the one that actually has a more serious plot story amidst the nudity and sexual situations It is the often told tale of three high school buddies who want to lose their virginity The go to the wrong places prostitutes the dangerous ones older woman with jealous boyfriend and the convenient ones luring their high school female counterparts The movie has a lot of funny moments and although the cast did not produce a single major movie star it is worth remembering for a fantastic 80s soundtrack that includes Devo The Cars Journey and others By today standards is raunchy and might have grabbed a NC17 rating but is a well told story of how sometimes personal fixation can only bring painwhile love might be right in front of us It is a little piece of 80s Americana and worth having in your movie collection
1,Being a 90s child I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons I dont know why early 90s cartoons had something special I dont know if it was the uncertainty atmosphere a generational change whatever But Tiny Toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show Easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead
1,Lets be fair there are no RULES for scriptwriting so I wont say the movie SHOULD be something other than it is Ill just state my opinion OK I really liked the script the way things are told and characters are introduced However I think when a play is adapted to the silver screen it could maybe try and fit this other media Since this movie was directed by João Falcão the same man who directed the play its not too much of a surprise that the film turned out a bit too theatrical Its the mans first movie for cryin outloud What Im saying is there are parts in the film  like the city of Nordestina which slightly resembles the set of Hoje é Dia de Maria  that feel like were not at a movie theater Were at the theater Lines are spoken too formally characters are moving choreographically and the lightening is clearly meant for a stage Sure maybe that was the intention but thats been done On stage Wonderful things have been made when adapting a play into a movie  the beautiful Closer for instance When I went to see this one though I didnt feel like I was watching a movie But overall it was a good one worth watching Its a nice love story funny at times and sad at others My vote is a 7
1,Sometimes reading the user comments on IMDB fills me with despair for the species For anybody to dismiss 2001 A Space Odyssey as boring they must have no interest in science technology philosophy history or the art of filmmaking Finally I understand why most Hollywood productions are so shallow and vacuous  they understand their audience Thankfully those that cannot appreciate Kubricks accomplishment are still a minority Most viewers are able to see the intelligence and sheer virtuosity that went into the making of this epic This is the film that put the science in science fiction and its depiction of space travel and mankinds future remains unsurpassed to this day It was so far ahead of its time that humanity still hasnt caught up 2001 is primarily a technical film The reason it is slow and filled with minutae is because the aim was to realistically envision the future of technology and the past in the awe inspiring opening scenes The films greatest strength is in the details Remember that when this film was made man still hadnt made it out to the moon but there it is in 2001 and thats just the start of the journey To create such an incredibly detailed vision of the future that 35 years later it is still the best we have is beyond belief  I still cant work out how some of the shots were done The films only notable mistake was the optimism with which it predicted mankinds technological and social development It is our shame that the year 2001 did not look like the film 2001 not Kubricks Besides the incredible special effects camera work and set design Kubrick also presents the viewer with a lot of food for thought about what it means to be human and where the human race is going Yes the ending is weird and hard to comprehend  but thats the nature of the future Kubrick and Clarke have started the task of envisioning it now its up to the audience to continue Theres no neat resolution no definitive full stop because then the audience could stop thinking after the final reel I know thats what most audiences seem to want these days but Kubrick isnt going to let us off so lightly Im glad to see that this film is in the IMDB top 100 films and only wish that it were even higher Stanley Kubrick is one of the very finest filmmakers the world has known and 2001 his finest accomplishment 1010
1,Yesterday I finally satisfied my curiosity and saw this movie My knowledge of the plot was limited to about 60 seconds of the trailer but I had heard some good critics which caused my expectations to increase As I saw the movie those untied pieces had been combined in a story that was becoming quite intriguing with some apparently inexplicable details But in the end everything is disclosed as a simple succession of events of bad luck sorte nula in Portuguese Above everything I felt that the story made sense and everything fits in its place properties of a good script I must also mention the soundtrack which helps the creation of an amazing environment And if you think of the resources Fernando Fragata used to make this film I believe it will make many Hollywood producers envious
1,North and South is a miniseries from the golden age of television miniseries in the 1980s which was a time for long sweeping epics with high production values and lots of star cameos It is for the most part excellent for what it is although I personally prefer the less soapopera like elements of the story and the overall sense of history James Read and Patrick Swayze deliver excellent performancesespecially Read whose George Hazard serves as kind of an emotional anchor in the midst of the often melodramatic story The series also contains topnotch work from Kirstie Alley Wendy Kilbourne Hal Holbrook Lewis Smith Genie Francis Georg Stanford Brown and others The costumes filming sets and music are all firstrate as well Dont take it as a history lesson but take it for what it isa wellmade sweeping epic from a bygone era Book 2 which followed a year later is also excellent but I would advise viewers to skip Book 3 which came out 8 years after Book 2 and was not nearly as good as the first two parts Books 1 and 2 are classics though even with their soapier elements and they are well worth watching
1,It is a surprising movie that gets you in your chair waiting for the last minute of the film leaving on your leaps a sweet taste of  I want more There are very good actors Portuguese actors that have a lot of experience in the world of theater and films It is not a million Euros budget film but still we can see the destruction of a car in an excellent perspective that gets you in the movie If you have the opportunity of getting your hands on this excellent film dont wait for another minute just see the film I think that Portuguese film are increasing the quality Watch out Spanish producers The Portuguese are getting a high quality standards I saw the film and Im waiting for more
1,I just finished watching this film For me the most outstanding work in this film was the music score While many silent film scores work very well with their scenes I feel that this is the best score Ive come across The mutiny scenes in particular worked extremely well
1,First of all this is an art film and a good one at that I loved the presentation and way it was shot Very cool Certain scenes were some of the more graphic horror sequences Ive ever seen This film did scare me not because of suspense or shock but because I was deathly afraid that Id soon see something REALLY appalling That did happen in a few places but mostly at the beginning This film also dragged and the 74 minutes seemed long However if youre into film you have to see this To date Ive seen nothing like it 810
1,Overall I give this film a decent 76 To start Ill say I love how the character was portrayed and adapted on to the screen If you read comics occasionally or simply watch DVD extras youll see the Blade character is drastically different from the one we see in the film Among the changes Blade is now most importantly half vampire therefore acquiring all of their strengths but none of their weaknesses The credit for this goes obviously to David Goyer a fellow fan of the darker genre of comic books Thanks to him Blade has become a much more interesting character and I find him one of my favorite antiheroes really Wesley Snipes is born to play this role although some wouldve probably pererred Dezenel Washington or Will Smith lol His acting here doesnt need to be exactly Oscar winning per say considering the character but Im glad he decids to play the DayWalker in the two sequels Also starring is Stephen Dorff as our main villain and Kris Kristofferson as Blades Alfred so to speak The acting is good actually and the action keeps the plot going for sure The opening scene in the club is one of my favorite parts Ive got to say As much as like this movie there are few things that bother me which take away from this film ranking with something like SpiderMan or XMen Stephen Norrington had the villains portrayed in a way I didnt like so much honestly Their lines were so full of foul mouthed comedy it didnt really feel like a comic book film to me Plus La Magra a bit disappointing as the final villain but the intense sword fight makes up for it I guess Not to mention a sense of extra nonrealism a black man in a leather coat with a sword beaing the  out of a cop in broad day light some how going unnoticed by the crowds walking by seemed kindawelldumb Moving away from a few of its flaws the music by Mark Isham was great and fitted the film nicely Luckily all these problems are fixed and improved on in the stunning sequel Blade 2
1,1956s The Man Who Knew Too Much is exceptional entertainment To those who prefer the 1934 original I will say that that one is faster paced and wittier However even though the American version was heaven forbid a big budget blockbuster I believe it blows the British version out of the water I think this is one of Hitchcocks 10 bestno small feat considering he made over 50 films and many of them were among the greatest of all time I find so many things to love 1James Stewart Americas favorite everyman for so many years does an excellent job playing the distressed father here He can make any film enjoyable and working with such a likeable character in such a gripping story he had me rooting for him very intensely Leslie Banks in the original is nothing in comparison 2Doris Day Yes Doris Day Despite all the criticisms directed toward her I think she makes the loving wifemother an extremely sympathetic person I disagree with the negative remarks towards her character just because she is softspoken and gentle it doesnt mean she is docile and helpless I dont want to spoil anything but she does make a crucial discovery by herself after her husband has failed She gives the story a level of warmth that just wasnt there in the first one and for those who care about that this version is the way to go And I loved Que Sera Sera I think it is one of the most beautiful songs Ive ever heard and deservedly won its Oscar It elevated the film to another level 3The Albert Hall sequence I dont think it was too long at all I think the suspense built the whole time to that terrific crescendo and Hitchcocks direction in this scene was absolutely brilliant And the assassin was truly frightening  4The ending really put a smile on my face even after the aforementioned scene was over I found the rescue scene to be exciting and it was great to see the charming family together again The last line in the film is highly amusing I dont think the film started out slowly Hithcock was trying to get us to know and like the McKennas and he did a great job I wasnt a huge fan of the kid playing Hank but I didnt have a problem with him Since Hank was Ben and Jos kid I cared about him too its not like he was a brat or anything  I found no major flaws in this movie and so many major and minor virtues Way to go Hitch
1,This is one of the better Marion Davies talkies  and one of the few to allow her to exhibit her skill as a physical comedian which was so endearing in her silent films OK so she does a clunky tap number but even Ruby Keelers dancing from the era does not hold up for younger generations The problem here is the script The story falls into unbelievable melodrama in the last reel Its quite stagey and is obviously adapted from a play but not well enough Still there is some snappy dialogue and slapstick throughout Worth a look
1,This is a funny clever film and well worth your time In my opinion it is much better than American Pie and other films of the same genre that seem to get knocked out all the time I hadnt heard of this film so I guess it didnt get much press which is kind of a shame It doesnt take itself too seriously but at the same time delivers a serious message to people about life and life experiences and what is importantAs opposed to a film about a bunch of desperate guys trying to get laid for the first time and one dude sticking his dk in a pie but in the end everyone gets laid and whoopdedo One thing that impressed me was that the soundtrack was pretty awesome and not the usual cheesy American poppunkThey actually had real punk from back in the day like the RamonesThat in itself made the film better To be honest I wasnt expecting much from this film and I was pleasantly surprised at how good a comedy it is
1,Cam Archers lyrical Bobbycrush boldly captures the disorienting kaleidoscope that is adolescent desire with a lush rendering beautifully photographed by Aaron Platt that is more vibe than narrative Caught somewhere between documentary and dream Bobbycrush recalls the inventiveness of early Todd Haynes and the vivid hyperrealism of Gus van Sant With grit glamour and heartbreak its kinda like the movie equivalent of Sonic Youth playing bubblegum pop
1,Id read all the negative reviews for Anna Christie You know the gripes about the static camera outdated acting and wordiness of the screenplay But when I viewed it yesterday I found it remarkably affecting and enjoyable Yep Clarence Browns camera remains stationary for the most part and Im pretty sure one of the microphones was concealed in the ships light Yep theres a lot of dialogue and no spectacular action sequences Its an early talkie with primitive technical aspects But then theres Garbo Marie Dressler George F Marion and Charles Bickford all proving that great acting is timeless I believe Anna Christie is still one of Garbos most iconic performances And its a wonderful performance from the Divine One in a role that is really quite atypical for her Yes weve seen Garbo weary and almost beaten yet never with bags under her eyes or her knocking back shots of whiskey Garbo played so many delightful costume roles that to see her play a contemporary woman is fascinating Shes not weighed down by heavy dresses or makeup This performance seems quite raw from Garbo The plot from the ONeill play follows weary Swedish exprostitute Anna and her reunion with her boozy seaman father Annas had enough trouble for any girl of twenty as she tells drunken slovenly Marthy Dresslerin a bar She finds solace in a life at sea and romance with a roughhewn but goodhearted fisherman Charles Bickford But her past threatens to ruin it all Charles Bickford is overlooked in Garbos long line of largely inferior leading men Hes one actor who can actually share the screen with her and not get swallowed up by her magical presence The pair have great chemistry together and seemed to enjoy working with one another Dressler can never be accused of underplaying and once again the grand dame is up to her old tricks but shes terrific and convincing in her role never annoying as in the dreadful Dinner At Eight Ive never really heard of George F Marion before but he was wonderful as Garbos father This is PreCode and rather gritty and dark by MGMs standards I really enjoyed it and while it may creak in some places its still wonderful
1,The title is a reference to the destruction of the remnants of a harvest like rice husks by farmers who burn them creating fires on the plains This is a bleak tale of the destruction of the Japanese soldier The story is set in the closing days of the Philippines campaign as a soldier with TB who returns from a hospital because since he can walk they have no room for him His superior officers dont want him around since hes really too sick to work or fight Abused by his officer hes sent back to the hospital with orders to either be admitted or kill himself They still wont take him and hes soon left to wander across the war ravaged landscape trying to find help or a place to stay or even just food Its a bleak journey with no hope in sight and only death and mans inhumanity to man at every turn Billed as a harrowing journey into the dark heart of man and war this is also a very funny movie This isnt to say its not horrifying it is at times but its also darkly comic How could it not be Here is a film where madness and insanity run rampant people are constantly trying to hustle tobacco leaves for food trying to get even a slightly better pair of shoes trying to remain a Japanese soldier in the face of absurdity by marching constantly but never getting anywhere and you cant help but laugh To be sure things go darker as it becomes clear that cannibalism maybe literally and figuratively the only way to survive but at the same time there is something uncomfortably funny about the human comedy Hailed as a great antiwar film its stark photographic style makes clear the insanity of war even as it dazzles our eye with its beauty Here we see landscapes full of bodies that include the soldier and the civilian set amid fields forests and trees that would otherwise be and to some extent still are quite beautiful Its a jarring sensation What intriguing is that I read that this is based on a novel about the redemptive power of Christianity The director removed all over the religious references to hope and salvation and instead used it as to show that life stinks war stinks worse and that there is ultimately no hope Intellectually I admire the film emotionally I dont Part of it is a strident downbeat score which for me over accentuates what we are seeing on the screen Its almost gilding the lily since the imagery is so strong it doesnt really need to have the music force you into feeling one way or another Is it a great film thats for you to decide For certain its unlike any other war film bloody horrific and real in ways that big budgeted films claim to be but never are This is not for those adverse to blood and gore since its here in spades Definitely worth a look
1,Its interesting to watch how late 1950s society is depicted in this film Men are lecherous chainsmoking boozers with one thing on their minds time hasnt changed men all that much but sexual harassment has  women are in the workplace only passing time until they find a husband  settle down Some of the dialog is cringeworthy but yet its charming in an innocent passé way I love the opening credits that show a romantic exciting view of Manhattan with Johnny Mathis singing The Best Of Everything on the soundtrack I want to jump right into some scenes filmed on NY streets circa 1959  experience a time Ive only seen on film  in photographs Some scenes in this movie reminded me of Melanie Griffiths Working Girl Especially when Hope Lange whos a cross between Grace Kelly  Dolores Hart gets bombed in handsome Stephen Boyds apartment he tucks her in  just watches her sleep like Melanie she wants to know if anything happened between them the following day Joan Crawford is definitely comparable to Sigourney Weavers horrible female boss except she was outwardly nasty with a soft core but Sigourneys character was sweet on the outside  horrible on the inside I found it distressing how the Suzy Parker character Gregg started out as an independent woman with career goals to be an actress who supposedly didnt need a man to complete her ended up She becomes a stalkerlunaticnutjob when she lets the man she falls in love with drive her bananas after hes done with her I loved the character Mary Agnes the office gossip with her thick New Yawk accent If you enjoy films like Valley Of The Dolls youll like this one too
1,I had the opportunity to see this last evening at a local film festival Herzog introduced the film and did an hour long QA afterward This is a brilliantly done documentary Herzog explained afterward that he does not consider his films to be true documentary since facts sometimes camouflage the truth Instead he scripts some scenes and adlibs some to introduce a new element that may have been missed if he followed the original story outline Little Dieter unlike Timothy Treadwell is a real person that you fall in love with you cheer for him you feel the anguish that he feels You admire the sense of humor and joy for life that he exhibited here 30 years after he was taken into captivity by the Viet Cong You are disappointed to hear afterward that Dieter passed on not too long ago As in most Herzog films the imagery is breathtakingly beautiful with a wonderful choice of background music Especially a scene of battle taken from archives of the Viet Nam war but fitting the story line of Dieter The core of the film has Dieter return to the hellish jungle where he was a POW and he reenacts his journey with some locals Harrowing for us to watch I cant imagine what he felt as he was bound again One of the better films to depict and discuss the nightmare of the Viet Nam war It should serve as a lesson to us all
1,Although it was dark depressing and at times hard to watch You Are Alone held my attention and was refreshingly honest in its dialog It truly captured the angst of teenage romantic relationships In addition the soundtrack was amazing The lyrics and the tone of the songs complemented the sadness of the film so well that it made you wonder if the tracks were created specifically for the movie  Jessica Bohl is the best actress I have ever watched Her compelling and believable performance made the movie It made me wonder if she really IS a prostitute Who knows Anyway the movie was very worth seeing LOVE YOUR SISTER yeah thats right
1,The bottom line is if you come looking for a scifi thrillerhorror film The Matrix is what youll like If like me you long for the rare true science fiction film involving characters with depth and provocative thought about where science will take us then you need to see eXistenZ
1,I liked this film very much as I liked before the other movies by Cedric Klapish All the actors coming from all over Europe are very good and funny One can really feel the influence of Amelie like in many other recent movies but its ok
1,OK maybe it doesnt deserve an Oscar Or a Golden Globe Or any award for that matter The acting isnt outstanding theres no reason to give credits to the directing and its really just another semigory 21st century slasher flick that MOST people will consider just decent Or maybe even dreadful But in my opinion all of this doesnt matter a bit And thats because i had a great time watching this movie Sure the first 40 minutes are pretty slow but as the movie progresses something in it you will like if you are like I was and anybody else should be when watching this movie And that is looking for 2 hours of fun mindless violence And a kickass ending which i wont spoil Yes there are many flaws in this movie but dont let the cast list on the front cover fool you Hilton delivers a decent performance that nobody saw coming Even her greatest haters like me and my friends had to agree that she surprised us greatly with her barely believable acting skills and a striptease that wasnt as nasty as anything an online popup would promise of her but still not so unbearable as to fastforward or turn off the DVD The violence in this surprised me nobody at school or on the horror board was talking about it like they were about these new movies called Saw and Hostel but I could safely say that Wax was more graphic than Saw and some death scenes were actually quite disturbing In conclusion Im not surprised House of Wax didnt make a place on the IMDb Top 250 but it is definitely worth a look
1,I watched Pola X because Scott Walker composed the film score and I admire his music a lot Frankly I expected a somewhat pretentious and possibly incoherent French movie I was wrong The vision of the film quickly managed to engage my attention to the fullest  starting with the opening sequence which shows black and white footage of military airplanes throwing bombs at graves at the sounds of music and Scott Walkers beautiful wailing voice The film explores the identity crisis of Pierre Guillaume Depardieu  a brilliant choice for the role and his consequential selfdestruction The story is divided into two parts  the first depicts Pierres carefree life in a beautiful house in the French countryside and the second follows his utter personal disintegration after he abandons everything and moves to Paris to live in squalor with his supposed halfsister Both parts contain some amazingly stunning photography  the first very colorful and bright the second utterly gloomy and nearly apocalyptic  adding up to a true aesthetic feast Pola X is a fascinating and quite unique movie experience
1,I didnt know what to expect  I only watched it on a rainy sunday afternoon on pay tv  Right from the start it drew me in  The music and settings and characters were excellent  I hadnt heard of any of the actors but they all were outstanding  A wonderful thriller  Now that ive read other comments on this movie referring to past versions and the book  i will be endeavouring to find out more on this great movie
1,Night of the Demons 1988 was another in a long line of teen horror films that were released on video and paytv during that mecca of film making the eighties But unlike most of the crap that was being peddled around this one was actually a decent watch A group of bored teenagers decide to party Halloween night away with a pair of bizarre sisters Mimi Kinkade and Linnea Quigley at the infamous Hull House Your usual cast of stereotypical teenagers are invited to the party But an average teenage bash turns into a night of terror as they try to survive Halloween night when they undead residents of Hull House decide to crash the party Wholl survive this night of bloodshed and horror A nice horror film that is best seen in the unrated version If you watch the RRated cut then youll miss all of the splatter effects and nudity Stay tune for the amusing epilogue A gory film that was followed by an equally entertaining sequel For horror fans only Highly recommended
1,Just to clarify Matthew Poncelet wasnt a real person but a character combination of 2 killers who were BOTH convicted and sentenced to die for a murder of two teenagers I read the User Comments and they react as if Matthew was real The character is based on a mixture of two killers Elmo Patrick Sonnier and Robert Lee Willie who murdered separate people and the murder itself was based on the one Willie committed The conflict of both Willie having someone else present and both parties swearing the other did the killing is worked into the story as well Prejeans approach is unique in that she not only is ministering to the convicts as they wait for their death and aiding them in taking responsibility for their actions she also reaches out to the victims families to help them know that the convict did indeed feel remorse for what they dideffectively aiding both parties Everyone posting here seems to have strong beliefs on the Death Sentence Its not my place to say its right or wrongin theory punishing death with death makes some sort of Karmic sense however denying a person their freedom for the rest of their days although costly makes more sense to mebeing stuck in a small room 237 with one hour of exercisefor the rest of their days to be reminded of the cruel thing they did seem a more apt punishmentthey are technically alive but denied living Say someone killed someone so they could get out of the responsibility the person they killed required like Susan Smith killing her poor kids by shoving her car into a lake I find it fittingly ironic that they would not get that freedom they craved and would now have to spend the rest of their days imprisoned Prejeans point comes through the story very well She has my respectshe manages to find that balanceshe isnt supporting a killer she is guiding them to accepting what they did If they didnt feel some kind of remorse they wouldnt be asking for spiritual guidance Ona final note when Poncelet apologizes to Delacroix parent for killing his son the parents of the girl who was also murdered mutters something about why he didnt apologize for her death I think the point was that throughout the movie Poncelet denies killing both kids There is doubt in Prejeans mind he did both killingsthere is a friend who was sentenced but not to deathmy thought is that Poncelet killed the Delacroix boy and the other man murdered the girlhence Poncelet was taking responsibility for what he did Had he been responsible for the girls death he probably would have apologized for that as well
1,Biographical tale of the life of Charles Lindbergh the first man to fly solo nonstop across the Atlantic in 1927 aboard his plane the Spirit of St Louis While not amongst Director Billy Wilders best films it does boast some very impressive production values especially for a film made 50 years ago The story is well told and the performances are also good though not outstanding One definite limiting factor upon the storytelling is that Lindbergh flew alone and without a radio which meant he has no one to speak with This necessitated a few different story telling techniques such as internal monologues speaking with a housefly and the occasional bouts of talking to himself especially once the exhaustion sets in Also in order to avoid an extended sequence of the famous flight it is interspersed with flashbacks from his life and the methodical preparations for the flight Charles Lindbergh was a huge hero of his era but his controversial beliefs would taint his legacy somewhat Despite this he would continue to contribute to the aviation field and assisted as a civilian aircraft consultant to the US effort in WWII Jimmy Stewart certainly had the flying background to back his portrayal of Lindbergh He rose to the rank of Colonel in US Air Force during WWII and while in the reserves following the War would reach the rank of Brigadier General
1,I saw this movie when it aired on the WB and fell in love with Riley Smith immediately I would recommend the movie to people of all ages who just feel like being entertained and not much more I wish theyd air it again or cast Riley Smith in another movie
1,At first I didnt think that the performance by Lauren Ambrose was anything but flaky but as her character developed the portrayal made more sense Amy Madigan seemed too terse for her role and didnt really tie her daughters characters together even though it was apparent that her character was disengaged with the character played by Lauren Ambrose Christopher Lloyd is a hit as usual and carried off his role to encourage the story line His character development left the audience wondering why he was chastised by the younger characters and could have been accomplished more directly with  The overwhelming glue to this somewhat vague story line was play by Taylor Roberts Her comprehensive delivery of a simplistic character held the movie together In this pivotal role Taylor was able to encourage a realistic family relationship between the characters while acting as the antagonist for all of the other relationships in the film
1,I just saw this film and I recommend it It has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good A very good film indeed about great and unconditional love Tom Wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering Emily Watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything I wont say more because it is better for you have to enter the story as it unfolds
1,While I cant say whether or not Larry Hama ever saw any of the old cartoons I would think that writing said cartoons file cards and some of the comics would count for something For fans of the old cartoon this is pretty much a continuation of the same except with a few new characters  and a more insane Cobra Commander We still have all the old favorites too but on a personal note one thing that always irritated me was this Duke in charge stuff when there are tons of other officers around instead The battle sequences are similar to the old series as well the main trick here seems to be the CGI Its overall pretty good if not a little overthetop
1,How did they get that cinematic shot of the car colliding with the back end of the semi And then Roy sits up  great Looks like the DVD is scheduled for May of 2006  about time Watch this on a large screen or film revival in a theater if possible in order to fully appreciate the full aspect ratio My other favorites in this category are Original Italian Job with Michael Caine Bullit with Steve McQueen To Live and Die in LA with the CSI guy when he was young French Connection with Gene Hackman Ronin with Robert Deniro Vanishing Point with Barry Newman Enemy of the State with Hackman again  What are your favorites
1,When the movie The Cure starts we find out about a young man named Erik Brad Renfro Erik is a teenage boy living with his paranoid mother and living next door to him is a young boy named Dexter Joseph Mazello One day Erik and Dexter connect and head up to the supermarket where Dexter gets his first taste of Butterfinger When Erik learns out that Dexter has AIDS he tries leavesandwater tea to make it better But when the front cover of The National Enquirer says a New Orleans doctor has found the cure for AIDS the two boys will stop at nothing to get to New Orleans for the cure In my opinion The Cure is easily one of the best friendship movies ever made It shows unconditional love between a boy his new best friend and his best friends mom Everything is so well done nothing needs to be changed Not only do I give this a 1010 for being a fantastic friendship movie but it also is a sad but humorous and fun AIDS movie And the tragic finale with Dexters contraction of AIDS is enough to make me shed a tear Very well done
1,This isin shortthe TV comedy series with the best cast everand the most likable alsoEach one of them is a firsthand comedy actorI know only one TV series which was better ie Moonlightingthat one had Willis as a leadyet it had Willis onlywhile The King of Queens has a pocketful of actors that are as fine as one can enjoyKevin James Leah Remini Jerry Stiller Patton Oswalt Nicole Sullivan Victor Williams Gary Valentineand even all the rest of them I spontaneously and continually and promptly liked itAdvancing age didnt spoil the funanyway In a few wordsthe series is intelligent and originalmiraculously spared of the current TV stupidity and garbage It is politically incorrect and doesnt court the minorities in the usual disgusting way The comic is very palatable and savory I read mostly approvingly a few IMDb writers and sometimes they write about their favorite showsyet though these writers are several I did not encountered at any of them the slightest mention of my favorite TV shows but its true that the critics one likes are not those with whom he finds himself in complete approvalbut those who at least offer a common basis for disapprovalwhich are mainly WILD WILD WEST MOONLIGHTING QUEENS FANTOMAS the 80s TWILIGHT ZONE Bradburys TV show and SANDOKAN Most of them I have seen when I was 1314 yrs about a few of them I have written and execrably
1,I liked this movie I wasnt really sure what it was about before I started watching it but enjoyed it nonetheless It was about a girl Meredith Monroe whose mom didnt want her to turn out like she did She meets and falls in love with a boy Riley Smith who is town for a charity football game Its a good movie I just hope it will be on again or comes out on video
1,I thought Anywhere But Here was a good movieIt stars two wonderful actresses Susan Sarandon and Natlie Portman which when I heard they were in a movie together I resist watching itOverall it was a pretty enjoyable movieIt had its moments where I felt as if they tried to hard and there was also some really overdone and wornout material but there wasnt anything in the movie that I absolutely hatedI even liked how they used the popup performance of the uncredited Thora Birch and all the little happysad moments are touching and effectiveIf you want to watch this movie go ahead because even though I dont recommend it its not something you should avoid and a 59 rating seems unfair in my opinion
1,Ice the Limerick A virus pulled out of the ice Just didnt know how to play nice If infected youll kill Because you are ill The cure is to be infected twice Ice is a great episode one of the greats from season 1 that began shaping the show and if you ask me you really couldnt ask for much better throughout the entire series It starts out with an awesome teaser which in my opinion is really one of the best teasers of the series also A group of scientists in Alaska have drilled something out of the ice core which has for some reason caused them to kill each other Now Mulder and Scully are sent with three other scientists to investigate what happened As Mulder says this is either because they are brilliant or expendable I take this to mean that they had better be brilliant or else The group soon finds out that the cause of mayhem is a small parasite pulled out of the ice core A little worm that gets into the bloodstream and causes violent behavior Since the pilot is infected the rest of the show turns to a suspenseful sort of whodoneit paranoiac thriller as the others begin to suspect each other of being infected This is not helped at all by an overly paranoid doctor Hodge who is untrusting of anyone which we learn early on by the first thing he asks to see everyones credentials to make sure we are who we say we are Events lead to finding out the one who is infected and learning how to cure them There are a number of things I like about the episode and of course certain characters that I want to smack in the face from this episode as well as a couple loopholes but most can be attributed to heightened caution and not thinking clearly I like Bear from the moment I first meet him Its a shame he has to die I also like the scene shown from the other scientists point of view as Mulder and Scully argue in the other room It gives an interesting twist to our typical perception as a viewer and for me seems to say maybe we shouldnt assume that just because someone is government means they know all sorts of conspiracy secrets As much as Hodges frustrates me in this episode I do think that Mulder was as much to blame for some of the rash actions taken as any I really like Scully in this episode First of all she can tackle like a frickin linebacker Second I really like the focus on her terror of what can happen to them out there and how she tries not to let trust and friendship of Mulder keep her from biasing her judgment I love the scene when she goes into the room to sleep and first looks as the picture of the previous group all hugging and the birthday presents from them to whoever used to sleep in that room and then how she suddenly freaks out and pushes the dresser in front of the door and in a final touch of subtlety as she sits on the floor with her knees pulled into her chest we see the bottom of a poster on the wall that says Bosom Buddies This is such great writing A way to say without any words that Scully is worried that she may not be able to trust even her very best friend Unfortunately this heightened suspicion leads the group to believe Mulder to be infected since he discovers Murphys dead body even though they havent inspected him at all to find out for sure That was my main problem with the behavior of the characters is they could easily have solved all the suspicion simply by giving blood But I guess I probably would have acted rashly in that situation too But then stupid Hodges decides that he has to assume Mulder is infected even though Mulder willingly surrenders and then is going willingly to be inspected and almost infects Mulder in the process Luckily he sees that it is really Dasilva that is infected and we finally reach a resolution At least as much as you can expect from an XFile The government wastes no time in torching the evidence as always happens in these cases and Mulder is left with yet another frustrating unsolved case In closing I give Ice and easy 1010 and I leave you with a haiku Were not who we are It goes no further than this It ends right here right now
1,This is the kind of movie that I grew up on It is great family fun that the kids love and the parents enjoy as well I wish more films like this were made Its a great story about a little boy who raises a Bull with his mother and sister and shows it all the way up to the National Grand Championship where he wins Then hes scared that someones going to barbecue his bull so he kidnaps it and heads home with it I was really excited when I first saw this film in the theater and was surprised to see George Strait Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis in this little film The music was great with all kinds of huge country names like Willie Nelson and the Dixie Chicks Anyone who doesnt enjoy this movie doesnt have any children or never was a kid them self
1,After seeing the oh so acclaimed Fargo and thinking it was nothing more than average I was wandering if it would be a good idea to rent another Coen masterpiece This time I was much less disappointed than I was with Fargo and I must say that most of the credit for that goes to the good jokes and the good acting of George Clooney Well done Mr Clooney make more of these and less Perfect Stormish movies You can act and you showed it here 7 out of 10
1,I read the book written by Bill Carter on which this movie is based many years ago The book is certainly stronger than the movie It provides more detail than a movie can possibly provide the end result being that I thought the movie seemed a wee bit sketchy on a handful of items All things considered though and given the limitations of the medium the movie provides a wholly entertaining and informative account of the battle between Jay Leno and David Letterman in the early 90s to host The Tonight Show after the retirement of Johnny Carson The highlight is clearly the performances I can think of no more difficult performance for an actor than to play a character who is still alive and wellknown and on TV on a regular basis John Michael Higgins nailed the part of Letterman perfectly Watching him really was like watching Letterman Daniel Roebuck tried valiantly to be Jay Leno but somehow didnt pull it off as effectively His whole look seemed fake and he just didnt seem natural in the role In a less central role Rich Little not surprisingly nailed the voice of Carson although the look was a bit off In the book the most interesting of the central figures was probably Lenos agent Helen Kushnick In the movie Kathy Bates was perfect in the role although not quite as out of control as Carters portrayal of the woman in writing In the end this is light and entertaining viewing The subject matter isnt especially important in the overall scheme of things but its a fun behind the scenes look at a memorable time in the entertainment industry 710
1,Sri Lanka not a country Ive ever given much thought to I have to admit I didnt even know it was near India let alone that there has been a bloody civil war going on there since 1983 It seems that the rebels of the Tamil minority have been in an ongoing conflict with the military regime that runs the country for many years causing many deaths and widespread suffering on the island Mani Ratmans latest film A PECK ON THE CHEEK tells the story of a young girl named Amudha who is separated from her Sri Lankan parents by the war and raised by a young Indian couple Amudha is a bright and mischievous girl whose life is turned upside down when her parents tell her that she was adopted as a child Although her adopted parents love her as much as could be and have raised her without prejudice along with their biological children Amudha cannot help but want to learn more about her biological family Mani Ratman is probably best known for his 1998 film DIL SE which hides a story about terrorism and politics inside a love story or is it the other way around A PECK ON THE CHEEK inhabits similar territory but is perhaps more ambitious in the ground it covers The central theme that binds the movie is of love between all the various members of a family and especially that between a child and her adopted parents Its a pretty honest and open look at feelings that can be extremely touching and heartwarming at some times and quite painful at others Its an emotionally complex film with characters that are somewhat idealised but still behave in a very human way The film revolves around 9 year old Amudha played with charm and vivaciousness by young actress PS Keerthana in her first and only acting role Shes a princess and a monster always getting into trouble but so disarmingly charming nobody can stay mad at her for long The young actress is perfectly cast for the role and does a tremendous job in the various and often difficult emotional scenes required of her A PECK ON THE CHEEK has such an innocent name I was quite unprepared for the intensity of the experience Never has such a small act come with such an enormous emotional impact I dare say The film is a bold and artistic effort to explore issues that are not frequently covered on the silver screen Mani Ratmans direction is superb very confident and mature  the most sophisticated work Ive seen from this director yet The film is visually very stylish with some excellent camerawork and imagery AR Rahman provides the films soundtrack which is not as good as his classic DIL SE or BOMBAY music based on first impressions at least but still shows his great musical talent Im not aware of a DVD release for the film yet  I saw it in Tamil with English subtitles thanks to the San Francisco International Film Festival of which the film was undoubtedly the highlight The production is a truly world class effort and I am sure it will be popular with western audiences as it begins to receive wider exposure Recommended
1,Movies are something you see on Saturday night and forget by Sunday morning Motion pictures are works of art that stick with you forever Mishima falls into the latter category This is the type of thing that should win Academy Awards a brilliant visual peice of film that is both depressing and uplifting Instead of doing a straightforward look at the life of Yukio Mishima director Paul Schrader interweaves three adaptations of the authors stories into a look at his past and final day on Earth the day he tried to lead the Japanese military into rebellion in the name of the Emperor Failing to do that he commits ritual suicide in an ending that hits you like a ton of bricks The three short story adaptations allow a look into what led him to this and are presented in an experimental way that makes them appear to be filmed stage plays Ken Ogata is magnificent as Mishima Despite his eccentricities he comes off as very sympathetic a man who is quite willing to die for his beliefs and does This makes the ending that much more devastating and the sense of loss more meaningful Of the three story adaptations Temple of the Golden Pavilion Kyokos House and Runaway Horses it is the last that is the strongest and most emotional It also is the story that most closely matches Mishimas mood in his final years and illustrates what truly led him to the events of November 1970 This review cannot be complete without a mention of Philip Glass striking musical score Not since 2001 has a film score been such a perfect compliment to its visuals Paul Schrader crafted one of the most beautiful movies of the 1980s or any other decade for that matter Have the hankies at the ready because the ending will leave you in tears Mishima A Life in Four Chapters reminds you that sometimes film can still be an art form and as art it is brilliant
1,Im glad they finally released it on DVD I bought the video tape years ago and watch it at least once or twice a year Grammer has a wry wit about him that really makes this movie a success Its formula is certainly not original but its very funny nonetheless I am very surprised that it didnt receive higher in the ratings It ranks as one of my alltime favorite comedies Its just a fun little flick that makes you feel good And sometimes thats all a movie is meant to be
1,With the war not going well for the Soviet Union Stalin accepted volunteers from the prisons and used the prisoners as shock troops This is the story of one such battalion There are petty crooks political prisoners soldiers kicked out of other units grayhaired veterans of the White Army plus some dangerous criminals They are thrown into battle illequipped untrained and face the threat of the NKVD if they show signs of cowardice or failure The special effects are rudimentary and many of the minor characters are onedimensional but the overall story is very human and riveting I have not seen a version with subtitles or dubbing Viewing the show required liberal use of the pause button and explanations from a native speaker of Russian
1,Plot Ed and Alice are engaged They live together and are living the dull life He has slept around before meeting Alice She has a lot less experience She decides she needs to sleep around before marrying He very reluctantly agrees they should both see other people for a while  At first he is not really into it His wild days are behind him and he is simply content Until one day Alice comes back and tells him she made out with some random guy who of course starts to fall for her  Of course this is a BAD idea which causes extreme strain on the relationship Good movie You can see the train wreck coming but still good Worth a rental
1,Think like a Dinosaur was an wellproduced  executed show of the Outerlimits series The actor Enrico Colantoni as Michael Burr plays an impressively well and convincing protagonistrole You can actually identify yourself with him and his introspective feelings on what to do to the girl whom he has fallen for because hes been alone and disappointed for 2 years and feels hopeless until Kamala comes to his life with a timid fear of performing the task of being transported He then consoles her and lets her know its all going to be alright which ends up being an deception to both of them More so something bad occurs and she prototype comes backand her clone is sent to the other inhabitant planet Although the Dino and Micheal have yet to find this out when they do its up to Michael to decide to either kill her or to let her live Yet what happen to him prior upon meeting her kamala was very much related to what happen to his wife his wife died similarly This show professes irregularity and sorrow thruout most of it After the show youre left ponderingabout what SHOULD have been done and youre stuck with the 5050 of whats right from wrong Hence The balance equation being solely there is no one 1010 Highly recommend watching this show
1,As is often the case when you attempt to take a 400 plus page book and cram it into a two hour film a lot is lost Here director John Madden Shakespeare in Love takes on an extremely ambitious project and almost pulls it off What we get is a charming and emotionally compelling film that seems somehow incomplete There is much about this film that is wonderful and fantastic The cinematography by John Toll Cinematographer for Braveheart and Legends of the Fall winning Oscars for both is splendid Working with Madden the choices for locations on the Greek island of Kefallonia are superb and the visual images that come from photographing these majestic locations in varying light are lush and beautiful Madden also uses numerous Greek actors as the townspeople giving the town an authentic feel The soundtrack is also terrific and the mandolin passages and vocals by the Italian soldiers are marvelous Madden does an excellent job of bringing us the Italian occupation and the romance which take up the greater part of the film There are numerous sweet and funny moments throughout this segment However by the time the serious battle drama is ready to unfold there isnt much film left in the reel and this component is extremely rushed and abbreviated While the battle scenes are well done subsequent to the battle it is obvious that increasingly greater compromises are being made to keep the film from running too long By the time we reach the post war scenes the treatment is merely skeletal Another negative is that the DVD is particularly sparse on features Nicholas Cage is charming in the romantic lead as the sentimental Captain who seems to have joined the army to sing rather than fight When fight he must Cage switches gears seamlessly into a man of fierce principle and resolve and somehow remains believable in both personas Penelope Cruz whom the camera loves gives an uninspired performance as Pelagia In part this is because Cage so dominates the screen but Cruz just seems too placid in a part that should be emotionally torrential and dynamic She allows the character to be objectified as Corellis love interest rather than establishing her as a powerful character in her own right John Hurt gives a fantastic performance as the wise old doctor who knows as much about human nature as medicine However Christian Bale seems a bit overwrought and stiff as Pelagias fiancé I rated this film an 810 Despite some drawbacks this is a touching film that is well worth seeing The photography alone is worth the price of admission
1,My husband dragged me to this film as I had no interest in seeing some Anime cartoon I was absolutely delighted by the simple story and amazing animation In a digital world where effects are computer generated it was refreshing to see gorgeous imaginative hand drawn animation The world of Sosuke and Ponyo is a vivid fantasyland intermixed with minimal reality I havent seen animation like this since I was a child and it is wonderful to see it endure and succeed The actors supplying the voices in the English version were fabulous The length of the movie was PERFECT especially for children who tend to get squirrelly in films Overall a delightful experience worth the very expensive ticket prices we have nowadays
1,Ninja Hunter AKA Wu Tang vs Ninja is pure entertainment from start to finish due to its outrageous characters nonsensical plot and lack of any pretensions whatsoever The makers of this film have given us a truly OTT masterpiece which has to be seen to be believed The plot centres around Wu Tang villain Abbot White who wants to destroy the Shaolin monks and become supreme martial artist In order to do so he teams up with a clan of Ninjas led by three masters  gold lamé ninja white mustachioed ninja and black ninja  and succeeds in destroying the Shaolin temple and most of its inhabitants However there are some survivors It is their job to pass on the knowledge of the Shaolin finger jab to a new generation who must defeat the ninjas and Abbott White if peace and order is to be restored Unfortunately Abbott White is a difficult foe to beat since he is able to make himself virtually indestructible by sucking the life force out of hot naked chicks an excuse for some welcome gratuitous nudity Other treats in store for viewers include loads of very impressive fighting despite some of it being speeded up some really amazing outfits the aforementioned gold lamé ninja Abbott Whites Yin Yang suits and even some assassins wearing Swastika tunics a ninja turning into a flying carpet plus some cheesy gore for good measure And I nearly forgot to mention the really impressive eyebrows on display in this movie  surely a good reason not to pass up on this gem
1,I liked this movie way too much My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside Of corse Ironside is just a low rent Jack Nicholson I guess Mike was busy that year with Highlander 2 The Quickening Sadly Beastmaster 2 would have been a much better career move It is certainly the best of the Beastmaster series and in many ways reminiscent of that great big screen classic Masters of the Universe Not only does it star the incomparable Mark Singer it also features an amazing supporting cast specifically the second girl from Sliders Uncle Phil from Fresh Prince of Belair and evil chick from Superman 2 It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets BEASTMASTER FOREVER ROCKN ROLL
1,I consider this film to be a complete masterpiece  actually I consider it to be Fernando Fragatas best work and undoubtedly the best of all Portuguese movies I dont think you can come across such a zero budget kind of film as impressive and astonishing as this one The direction is done with perfection at an incredible fast pace and the music also composed by Fragata is mostly excellent The story is creepy and humorous at the same time and it is certainly an advanced study of the old saying Misery loves company kind of situations intertwined with a mind boggling mystery A more than perfect recipe to glue the viewers eyes to the screen from frame one to the last Its been called NeoHitchcock and Ill agree Much like the best Hitchcocks it kept me guessing during the entire film and most of my suppositions were far for what ends up being smartly revealed
